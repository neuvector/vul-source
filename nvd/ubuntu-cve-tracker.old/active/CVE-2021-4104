Description:
 JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data
 when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker
 can provide TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName
 configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in
 remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. Note this
 issue only affects Log4j 1.2 when specifically configured to use
 JMSAppender, which is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life
 in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous
 other issues from the previous versions.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> This issue is similar to CVE-2021-44228, but for log2j < 2.0 and
  is only vulnerable if configured to use JMSAppender.
  For an environment to be vulnerable, an attacker would need write access
  to the log4j.properties configuration file to specifically enable the JMS
  Appender and configure it with a JNDI lookup to a third party server. If
  an attacker has write access to the log4j.properties configuration file,
  there are also other configuration options that can be used to perform
  code execution attacks. We therefore recommend configuration files be set
  with appropriate permissions to only permit being modified by trusted
  individuals.
