Description:
 OpenSearch is open-source software suite for search, analytics, and
 observability applications. Prior to versions 1.3.10 and 2.7.0, there is an
 issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules
 (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where
 they are not correctly applied to the queries during extremely rare race
 conditions potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. For this
 issue to be triggered, two concurrent requests need to land on the same
 instance exactly when query cache eviction happens, once every four hours.
 OpenSearch 1.3.10 and 2.7.0 contain a fix for this issue.
