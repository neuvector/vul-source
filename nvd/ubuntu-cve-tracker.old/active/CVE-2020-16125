Description:
 gdm3 versions before 3.36.2 or 3.38.2 would start gnome-initial-setup if
 gdm3 can't contact the accountservice service via dbus in a timely manner;
 on Ubuntu (and potentially derivatives) this could be be chained with an
 additional issue that could allow a local user to create a new privileged
 account.
