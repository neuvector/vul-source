Description:
 Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client written from scratch for Node.js. Prior to
 version 5.26.2, Undici already cleared Authorization headers on
 cross-origin redirects, but did not clear `Cookie` headers. By design,
 `cookie` headers are forbidden request headers, disallowing them to be set
 in RequestInit.headers in browser environments. Since undici handles
 headers more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect from the
 assumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation of fetch. As such
 this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a third-party site or a
 malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open
 redirector) to leak the cookie to the third party site. This was patched in
 version 5.26.2. There are no known workarounds.
