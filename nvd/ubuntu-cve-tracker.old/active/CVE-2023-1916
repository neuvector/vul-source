 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6428-1
Description:
 A flaw was found in tiffcrop, a program distributed by the libtiff package.
 A specially crafted tiff file can lead to an out-of-bounds read in the
 extractImageSection function in tools/tiffcrop.c, resulting in a denial of
 service and limited information disclosure. This issue affects libtiff
 versions 4.x.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> low security impact as it is a denial of service in a command-
 mdeslaur> line tool only, marking as low priority
 ccdm94> As of 2023-08-22, the fix for this issue seems to have not been
 ccdm94> merged (https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/merge_requests/476).
 mdeslaur> There is a new merge request here: https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/merge_requests/535
 mdeslaur> Since the tiffcrop tool has been removed, the merge request will
 mdeslaur> go nowhere, but can likely be used to fix previous releases.
