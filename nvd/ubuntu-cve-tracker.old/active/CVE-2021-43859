Description:
 XStream is an open source java library to serialize objects to XML and back
 again. Versions prior to 1.4.19 may allow a remote attacker to allocate
 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel
 execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by
 manipulating the processed input stream. XStream 1.4.19 monitors and
 accumulates the time it takes to add elements to collections and throws an
 exception if a set threshold is exceeded. Users are advised to upgrade as
 soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may set the NO_REFERENCE mode to
 prevent recursion. See GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf for further details on a
 workaround if an upgrade is not possible.
