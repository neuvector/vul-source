Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Versions prior to 9.1.6 and 8.5.13 are vulnerable to an escalation from
 admin to server admin when auth proxy is used, allowing an admin to take
 over the server admin account and gain full control of the grafana
 instance. All installations should be upgraded as soon as possible. As a
 workaround deactivate auth proxy following the instructions at:
 https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/auth-proxy/
