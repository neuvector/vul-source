Description:
 A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer
 overflow was discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before it
 validates the received DNS entries. This flaw allows a remote attacker, who
 can create valid DNS replies, to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated
 memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in
 rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute
 memcpy() with a negative size in sort_rrset() and cause a crash in dnsmasq,
 resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to system availability.
