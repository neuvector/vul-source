Description:
 A flaw was found in podman. The `podman machine` function (used to create
 and manage Podman virtual machine containing a Podman process) spawns a
 `gvproxy` process on the host system. The `gvproxy` API is accessible on
 port 7777 on all IP addresses on the host. If that port is open on the
 host's firewall, an attacker can potentially use the `gvproxy` API to
 forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making private services on
 the VM accessible to the network. This issue could be also used to
 interrupt the host's services by forwarding all ports to the VM.
