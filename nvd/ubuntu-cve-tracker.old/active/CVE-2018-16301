Description:
 The command-line argument parser in tcpdump before 4.99.0 has a buffer
 overflow in tcpdump.c:read_infile(). To trigger this vulnerability the
 attacker needs to create a 4GB file on the local filesystem and to specify
 the file name as the value of the -F command-line argument of tcpdump.
