Description:
 Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Users publishing a composer.phar
 to a public web-accessible server where the composer.phar can be executed
 as a php file may be subject to a remote code execution vulnerability if
 PHP also has `register_argc_argv` enabled in php.ini. Versions 2.6.4,
 2.2.22 and 1.10.27 patch this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.
 Users unable to upgrade should make sure `register_argc_argv` is disabled
 in php.ini, and avoid publishing composer.phar to the web as this is not
 best practice.
