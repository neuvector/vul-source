Description:
 In FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.14.0-rc1, resource exhaustion can
 occur because of a lack of a check in primitive value deserializers to
 avoid deep wrapper array nesting, when the UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS
 feature is enabled. Additional fix version in 2.13.4.1 and 2.12.17.1
