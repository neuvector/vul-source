Description:
 Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
 desktop applications on Linux. Versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4,
 and 1.15.4 contain a vulnerability similar to CVE-2017-5226, but using the
 `TIOCLINUX` ioctl command instead of `TIOCSTI`. If a Flatpak app is run on
 a Linux virtual console such as `/dev/tty1`, it can copy text from the
 virtual console and paste it into the command buffer, from which the
 command might be run after the Flatpak app has exited. Ordinary graphical
 terminal emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal and Konsole are unaffected.
 This vulnerability is specific to the Linux virtual consoles `/dev/tty1`,
 `/dev/tty2` and so on. A patch is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8,
 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, don't run Flatpak on a Linux virtual
 console. Flatpak is primarily designed to be used in a Wayland or X11
 graphical environment.
