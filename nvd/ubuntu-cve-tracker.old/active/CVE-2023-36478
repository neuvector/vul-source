Description:
 Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions
 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52,
 an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK
 header values to exceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines
 if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception
 if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is
 true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295 will overflow, and length will
 become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on
 line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize`
 allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative,
 potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the
 user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a
 negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when
 multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is
 a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause
 a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be
 impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in
 versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds.
