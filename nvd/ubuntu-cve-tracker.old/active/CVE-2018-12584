Description:
 The ConnectionBase::preparseNewBytes function in
 resip/stack/ConnectionBase.cxx in reSIProcate through 1.10.2 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code when TLS communication is enabled.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that reSIProcate incorrectly handled SIP message
 bodies. A remote attacker could exploit this with a crafted SIP message to
 cause reSIProcate to crash, resulting in a denial of service (buffer
 overflow).
