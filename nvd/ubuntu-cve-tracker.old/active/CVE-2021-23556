Description:
 The package guake before 3.8.5 are vulnerable to Exposed Dangerous Method
 or Function due to the exposure of execute_command and
 execute_command_by_uuid methods via the d-bus interface, which makes it
 possible for a malicious user to run an arbitrary command via the d-bus
 method. **Note:** Exploitation requires the user to have installed another
 malicious program that will be able to send dbus signals or run terminal
 commands.
