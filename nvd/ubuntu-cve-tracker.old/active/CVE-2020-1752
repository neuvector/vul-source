Description:
 A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14
 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths
 containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by
 this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
 specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would
 potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version
 2.32.
