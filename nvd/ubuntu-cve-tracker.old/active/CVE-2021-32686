Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
 STUN, TURN, and ICE. In PJSIP before version 2.11.1, there are a couple of
 issues found in the SSL socket. First, a race condition between callback
 and destroy, due to the accepted socket having no group lock. Second, the
 SSL socket parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. Both issues
 were reported to happen intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They
 cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service. These are fixed in version
 2.11.1.
