Description:
 There are several memory leaks in the MIFF coder in /coders/miff.c due to
 improper image depth values, which can be triggered by a specially crafted
 input file. These leaks could potentially lead to an impact to application
 availability or cause a denial of service. It was originally reported that
 the issues were in `AcquireMagickMemory()` because that is where
 LeakSanitizer detected the leaks, but the patch resolves issues in the MIFF
 coder, which incorrectly handles data being passed to
 `AcquireMagickMemory()`. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to
 7.0.9-0.
