Description:
 The LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugin in KDE Kate before 21.12.2 and
 KTextEditor before 5.91.0 tries to execute the associated LSP server binary
 when opening a file of a given type. If this binary is absent from the
 PATH, it will try running the LSP server binary in the directory of the
 file that was just opened (due to a misunderstanding of the QProcess API,
 that was never intended). This can be an untrusted directory.
