Description:
 A vulnerability was discovered in ImageMagick where a specially created SVG
 file loads itself and causes a segmentation fault. This flaw allows a
 remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file that leads to a
 segmentation fault, generating many trash files in "/tmp," resulting in a
 denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates a lot of trash
 files. These trash files can be large if the SVG file contains many render
 actions. In a denial of service attack, if a remote attacker uploads an SVG
 file of size t, ImageMagick generates files of size 103*t. If an attacker
 uploads a 100M SVG, the server will generate about 10G.
