Description:
 undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js. It is
 possible to inject CRLF sequences into request headers in undici in
 versions less than 5.7.1. A fix was released in version 5.8.0. Sanitizing
 all HTTP headers from untrusted sources to eliminate `\r\n` is a workaround
 for this issue.
