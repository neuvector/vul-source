Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Janino 3.1.9 and earlier are subject to denial of service
 (DOS) attacks when using the expression evaluator.guess parameter name
 method. If the parser runs on user-supplied input, an attacker could supply
 content that causes the parser to crash due to a stack overflow. NOTE: this
 is disputed by multiple parties because Janino is not intended for use with
 untrusted input.
