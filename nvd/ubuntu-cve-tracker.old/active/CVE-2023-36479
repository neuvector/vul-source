Description:
 Eclipse Jetty Canonical Repository is the canonical repository for the
 Jetty project. Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command
 structure may have the wrong command executed. If a user sends a request to
 a org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary with a space in its
 name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation
 marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be
 executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name
 provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the
 resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one. This
 issue was patched in version 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16 and 12.0.0-beta2.
