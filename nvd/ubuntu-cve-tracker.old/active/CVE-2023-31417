Description:
 Elasticsearch generally filters out sensitive information and credentials
 before logging to the audit log. It was found that this filtering was not
 applied when requests to Elasticsearch use certain deprecated URIs for
 APIs. The impact of this flaw is that sensitive information such as
 passwords and tokens might be printed in cleartext in Elasticsearch audit
 logs. Note that audit logging is disabled by default and needs to be
 explicitly enabled and even when audit logging is enabled, request bodies
 that could contain sensitive information are not printed to the audit log
 unless explicitly configured.
