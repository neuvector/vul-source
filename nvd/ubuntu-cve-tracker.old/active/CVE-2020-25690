Description:
 An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in FontForge in versions before
 20200314 while parsing SFD files containing certain LayerCount tokens. This
 flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the memory allocated on the heap,
 causing the application to crash or execute arbitrary code. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as
 system availability.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray| This is a Red Hat specific CVE due to an insufficient backport of
  the upstream patch in CVE-2020-5395. Since that CVE is not yet patched in
  Ubuntu, I am adding this CVE to be tracked so we don't make the same
  mistake.
