Description:
 Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security.
 Prior to version 2.1.4, a buffer that was used for inbound network traffic
 had no upper limit. Pion DTLS would buffer all network traffic from the
 remote user until the handshake completes or timed out. An attacker could
 exploit this to cause excessive memory usage. Version 2.1.4 contains a
 patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds available.
