Description:
 In LemonLDAP::NG (aka lemonldap-ng) before 2.0.7, the default Apache HTTP
 Server configuration does not properly restrict access to SOAP/REST
 endpoints (when some LemonLDAP::NG setup options are used). For example, an
 attacker can insert index.fcgi/index.fcgi into a URL to bypass a Require
 directive.
