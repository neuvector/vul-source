Description:
 A flaw was found in cairo's image-compositor.c in all versions prior to
 1.17.4. This flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file
 to cairo's image-compositor (for example, by convincing a user to open a
 file in an application using cairo, or if an application uses cairo on
 untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow -> out-of-bounds WRITE.
 The highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
 integrity, as well as system availability.
