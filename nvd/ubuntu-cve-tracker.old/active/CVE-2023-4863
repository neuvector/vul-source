Description:
 Heap buffer overflow in libwebp in Google Chrome prior to 116.0.5845.187
 and libwebp 1.3.2 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds
 memory write via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity:
 Critical)
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> The Debian chromium source package is called chromium-browser
 alexmurray> in Ubuntu
 mdeslaur> starting with Ubuntu 19.10, the chromium-browser package is just
 mdeslaur> a script that installs the Chromium snap
 rodrigo-zaiden> in libwebp source, it seems like the affected versions
  starts from 0.5.0, with a high probability that the commit f75dfbf2 is
  the one adding the issue. I can be wrong in my assumption but, at least,
  the reproducer available in the the-webp-0day blog post, reproduces in
  0.5.0 but not in 0.4.4, and the buffer huffman_tables was added in the
  mentioned commit.
 rodrigo-zaiden> in Ubuntu, libwebp versions earlier than 0.5.0 does not
  contain the affected code, hence are probably not affected.
