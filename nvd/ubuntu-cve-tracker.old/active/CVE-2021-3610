Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in ImageMagick in
 versions prior to 7.0.11-14 in ReadTIFFImage() in coders/tiff.c. This issue
 is due to an incorrect setting of the pixel array size, which can lead to a
 crash and segmentation fault.

Notes:
 alexmurray> Originally this was though to be an issue specific to IM7, but
  turns out it also applies to IM6 versions from 6.9.10.88. As such Ubuntu
  releases since jammy are likely affected.
