Description:
 Lack of error handling in the TCP server in Google's gRPC starting version
 1.23 on posix-compatible platforms (ex. Linux) allows an attacker to cause
 a denial of service by initiating a significant number of connections with
 the server. Note that gRPC C++ Python, and Ruby are affected, but gRPC
 Java, and Go are NOT affected.
