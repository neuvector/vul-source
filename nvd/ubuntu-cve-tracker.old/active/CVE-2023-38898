Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue in Python cpython v.3.7 allows an attacker to
 obtain sensitive information via the _asyncio._swap_current_task component.
 NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because (1) neither 3.7 nor any other
 release is affected (it is a bug in some 3.12 pre-releases); (2) there are
 no common scenarios in which an adversary can call
 _asyncio._swap_current_task but does not already have the ability to call
 arbitrary functions; and (3) there are no common scenarios in which
 sensitive information, which is not already accessible to an adversary,
 becomes accessible through this bug.
