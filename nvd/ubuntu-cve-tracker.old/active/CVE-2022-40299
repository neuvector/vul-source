Description:
 In Singular before 4.3.1, a predictable /tmp pathname is used (e.g., by
 sdb.cc), which allows local users to gain the privileges of other users via
 a procedure in a file under /tmp. NOTE: this CVE Record is about sdb.cc and
 similar files in the Singular interface that have predictable /tmp
 pathnames; this CVE Record is not about the lack of a safe temporary-file
 creation capability in the Singular language.
