Description:
 An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from
 15.4 prior to 15.4.4, and 15.5 prior to 15.5.2. GitLab was not performing
 correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address
 restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of
 a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.
