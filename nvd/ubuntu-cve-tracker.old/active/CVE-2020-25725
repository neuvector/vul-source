Description:
 In Xpdf 4.02, SplashOutputDev::endType3Char(GfxState *state)
 SplashOutputDev.cc:3079 is trying to use the freed `t3GlyphStack->cache`,
 which causes an `heap-use-after-free` problem. The codes of a previous fix
 for nested Type 3 characters wasn't correctly handling the case where a
 Type 3 char referred to another char in the same Type 3 font.
