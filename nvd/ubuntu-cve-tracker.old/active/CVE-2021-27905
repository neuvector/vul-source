Description:
 The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at "/replication" under a Solr
 core) in Apache Solr has a "masterUrl" (also "leaderUrl" alias) parameter
 that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core
 to replicate index data into the local core. To prevent a SSRF
 vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar
 configuration it uses for the "shards" parameter. Prior to this bug getting
 fixed, it did not. This problem affects essentially all Solr versions prior
 to it getting fixed in 8.8.2.
