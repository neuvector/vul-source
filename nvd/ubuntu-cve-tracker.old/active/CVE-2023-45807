Description:
 OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and
 Kibana following the license change in early 2021. There is an issue with
 the implementation of tenant permissions in OpenSearch Dashboards where
 authenticated users with read-only access to a tenant can perform create,
 edit and delete operations on index metadata of dashboards and
 visualizations in that tenant, potentially rendering them unavailable. This
 issue does not affect index data, only metadata. Dashboards correctly
 enforces read-only permissions when indexing and updating documents. This
 issue does not provide additional read access to data users don’t already
 have. This issue can be mitigated by disabling the tenants functionality
 for the cluster. Versions 1.3.14 and 2.11.0 contain a fix for this issue.
