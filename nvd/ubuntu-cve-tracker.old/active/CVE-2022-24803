Description:
 Asciidoctor-include-ext is Asciidoctor’s standard include processor
 reimplemented as an extension. Versions prior to 0.4.0, when used to render
 user-supplied input in AsciiDoc markup, may allow an attacker to execute
 arbitrary system commands on the host operating system. This attack is
 possible even when `allow-uri-read` is disabled! The problem has been
 patched in the referenced commits.
