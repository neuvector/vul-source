Description:
 github.com/crewjam/saml is a saml library for the go language. In affected
 versions the package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to
 the SAML binding being parsed. If abused, this flaw allows attackers to
 register malicious Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in
 the ACS endpoint definition, achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the
 IdP context during the redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow.
 Consequently, an attacker may perform any authenticated action as the
 victim once the victim’s browser loaded the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for
 the malicious service provider. Note: SP registration is commonly an
 unrestricted operation in IdPs, hence not requiring particular permissions
 or publicly accessible to ease the IdP interoperability. This issue is
 fixed in version 0.4.14. Users unable to upgrade may perform external
 validation of URLs provided in SAML metadata, or restrict the ability for
 end-users to upload arbitrary metadata.
