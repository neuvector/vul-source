Description:
 A relative path traversal vulnerability in a FileUtil class used by the
 PEAR management component of Apache UIMA allows an attacker to create files
 outside the designated target directory using carefully crafted ZIP entry
 names. This issue affects Apache UIMA Apache UIMA version 3.3.0 and prior
 versions. Note that PEAR files should never be installed into an UIMA
 installation from untrusted sources because PEAR archives are executable
 plugins that will be able to perform any actions with the same privileges
 as the host Java Virtual Machine.
