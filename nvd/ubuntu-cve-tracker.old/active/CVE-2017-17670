Description:
 In VideoLAN VLC media player through 2.2.8, there is a type conversion
 vulnerability in modules/demux/mp4/libmp4.c in the MP4 demux module leading
 to a invalid free, because the type of a box may be changed between a read
 operation and a free operation.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mikesalvatore> According to the openwall thread, "the VLC project probably
                won't backport a fix to 2.2.x." I'm deferring this CVE.
