Description:
 Those using java.sql.Statement or java.sql.PreparedStatement in hsqldb
 (HyperSQL DataBase) to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to a
 remote code execution attack. By default it is allowed to call any static
 method of any Java class in the classpath resulting in code execution. The
 issue can be prevented by updating to 2.7.1 or by setting the system
 property "hsqldb.method_class_names" to classes which are allowed to be
 called. For example, System.setProperty("hsqldb.method_class_names", "abc")
 or Java argument -Dhsqldb.method_class_names="abc" can be used. From
 version 2.7.1 all classes by default are not accessible except those in
 java.lang.Math and need to be manually enabled.
