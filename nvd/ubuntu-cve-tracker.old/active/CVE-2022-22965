Description:
 A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be
 vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific
 exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If
 the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the
 default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the
 vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.
