Description:
 Elvish is a programming language and interactive shell, combined into one
 package. In versions prior to 0.14.0 Elvish's web UI backend (started by
 `elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint that allows executing the code sent from
 the web UI. The backend does not check the origin of requests correctly. As
 a result, if the user has the web UI backend open and visits a compromised
 or malicious website, the website can send arbitrary code to the endpoint
 in localhost. All Elvish releases from 0.14.0 onward no longer include the
 the web UI, although it is still possible for the user to build a version
 from source that includes the web UI. The issue can be patched for previous
 versions by removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web,
 depending on the exact version).
