Description:
 There exists a race condition between the deletion of the temporary file
 and the creation of the temporary directory in `webkit` subproject of
 HTML/Java API version 1.7. A similar vulnerability has recently been
 disclosed in other Java projects and the fix in HTML/Java API version 1.7.1
 follows theirs: To avoid local privilege escalation version 1.7.1 creates
 the temporary directory atomically without dealing with the temporary file:
