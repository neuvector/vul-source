Description:
 wolfSSL before 4.5.0 mishandles TLS 1.3 server data in the WAIT_CERT_CR
 state, within SanityCheckTls13MsgReceived() in tls13.c. This is an
 incorrect implementation of the TLS 1.3 client state machine. This allows
 attackers in a privileged network position to completely impersonate any
 TLS 1.3 servers, and read or modify potentially sensitive information
 between clients using the wolfSSL library and these TLS servers.
