Description:
 In Nim 1.2.4, the standard library httpClient is vulnerable to a CR-LF
 injection in the target URL. An injection is possible if the attacker
 controls any part of the URL provided in a call (such as httpClient.get or
 httpClient.post), the User-Agent header value, or custom HTTP header names
 or values.
