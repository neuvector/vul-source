Description:
 OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
 share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network.
 The website mode of the onionshare allows to use a hardened CSP, which will
 block any scripts and external resources. It is not possible to configure
 this CSP for individual pages and therefore the security enhancement cannot
 be used for websites using javascript or external resources like fonts or
 images.
