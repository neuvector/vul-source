Description:
 Multiple exploitable integer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the
 MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content
 library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an integer
 overflow due to unchecked addition arithmetic resulting in a heap-based
 buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a
 user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.
