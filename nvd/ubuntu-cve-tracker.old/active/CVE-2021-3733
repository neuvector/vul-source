Description:
 There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who
 controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser)
 connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS)
 during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is
 sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses
 is to application availability.

Notes:
 leosilva> code affected in hirsute and devel is already patched, so both releases
