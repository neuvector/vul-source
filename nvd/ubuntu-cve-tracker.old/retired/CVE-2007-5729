Candidate: CVE-2007-5729

 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5729
Description:
 The NE2000 emulator in QEMU 0.8.2 allows local users to execute arbitrary
 code by writing Ethernet frames with a size larger than the MTU to the
 EN0_TCNT register, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in the slirp
 library, aka NE2000 "mtu" heap overflow.  NOTE: some sources have used
 CVE-2007-1321 to refer to this issue as part of "NE2000 network driver and
 the socket code," but this is the correct identifier for the mtu overflow
 vulnerability.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> kvm includes qemu (0.9.1 on hardy)
 jdstrand> kvm does not use ne2000 by default
