Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. During USB device
 initialization, descriptors are read with very little bounds checking and
 assumes the USB device is providing sane values. If properly exploited, an
 attacker could trigger memory corruption leading to arbitrary code
 execution allowing a bypass of the Secure Boot mechanism. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as
 well as system availability.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sbeattie| Ubuntu packaging does not include the usb module in the
   signed EFI grub artifacts, so is not affected.
 sbeattie| grub2-unsigned will contain fixes and supersede grub2, which
  will contain only BIOS grub bits.
