Description:
 A flaw was discovered in fence-agents, prior to version 4.3.4, where using
 non-ASCII characters in a guest VM's comment or other fields would cause
 fence_rhevm to exit with an exception. In cluster environments, this could
 lead to preventing automated recovery or otherwise denying service to
 clusters of which that VM is a member.
