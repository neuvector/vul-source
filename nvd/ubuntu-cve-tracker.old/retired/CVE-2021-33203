Description:
 Django before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 has a
 potential directory traversal via django.contrib.admindocs. Staff members
 could use the TemplateDetailView view to check the existence of arbitrary
 files. Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have
 been customized by application developers to also show file contents, then
 not only the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed.
 In other words, there is directory traversal outside of the template root
 directories.
