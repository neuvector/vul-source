Description:
 Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
 reusable PHP components. A vulnerability related to firewall authentication
 is in Symfony starting with version 5.3.0 and prior to 5.3.2. When an
 application defines multiple firewalls, the token authenticated by one of
 the firewalls was available for all other firewalls. This could be abused
 when the application defines different providers for each part of the
 application, in such a situation, a user authenticated on a part of the
 application could be considered authenticated on the rest of the
 application. Starting in version 5.3.2, a patch ensures that the
 authenticated token is only available for the firewall that generates it.
