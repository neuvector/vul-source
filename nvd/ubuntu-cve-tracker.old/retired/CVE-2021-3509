 A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In
 response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an

 response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The
 greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and
 availability.

 cross-site scripting attack. An attacker could use this to expose
 sensitive information or gain unintended access.
