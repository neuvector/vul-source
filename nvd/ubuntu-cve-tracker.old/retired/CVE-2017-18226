Description:
 The Gentoo net-im/jabberd2 package through 2.6.1 sets the ownership of
 /var/run/jabber to the jabber account, which might allow local users to
 kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this account for PID file
 modification before a root script executes a "kill -TERM `cat
 /var/run/jabber/filename.pid`" command.
