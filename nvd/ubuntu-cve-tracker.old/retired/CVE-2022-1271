Description:
 An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep
 utility. When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for
 example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to
 an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient
 validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where
 selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted
 multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker
 to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.
