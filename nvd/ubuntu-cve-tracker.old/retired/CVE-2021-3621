Description:
 A flaw was found in SSSD, where the sssctl command was vulnerable to shell
 command injection via the logs-fetch and cache-expire subcommands. This
 flaw allows an attacker to trick the root user into running a specially
 crafted sssctl command, such as via sudo, to gain root access. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as
