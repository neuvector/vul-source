Description:
 Apache Solr versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.6, 7.0.0 to 7.7.3 and 8.0.0 to 8.6.2
 prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote
 code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that's uploaded via API
 without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to prevent such
 features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE
 actions.
