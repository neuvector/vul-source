Description:
 An issue was discovered in Valve Steam Client 2.10.91.91. The installer
 allows local users to gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges because some
 parts of %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam and/or %COMMONPROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam
 have weak permissions during a critical time window. An attacker can make
 this time window arbitrarily long by using opportunistic locks.
