 https://github.com/PanguL4b/pocs/tree/master/xpdf/heap-buffer-overflow_JBIG2Stream__readTextRegionSeg
Description:
 In Xpdf 4.01.01, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the function
 JBIG2Stream::readTextRegionSeg() located at JBIG2Stream.cc. It can, for
 example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftoppm
 tool. It might allow an attacker to cause Information Disclosure.
