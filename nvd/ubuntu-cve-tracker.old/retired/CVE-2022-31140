Description:
 Valinor is a PHP library that helps to map any input into a strongly-typed
 value object structure. Prior to version 0.12.0, Valinor can use
 `Throwable#getMessage()` when it should not have permission to do so. This
 is a problem with cases such as an SQL exception showing an SQL snippet, a
 database connection exception showing database IP
 address/username/password, or a timeout detail / out of memory detail.
 Attackers could use this information for potential data exfiltration,
 denial of service attacks, enumeration attacks, etc. Version 0.12.0
 contains a patch for this vulnerability.
