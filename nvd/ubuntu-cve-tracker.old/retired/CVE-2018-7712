Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The validateInputImageSize function in
 modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp in OpenCV 3.4.1 allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (assertion failure) because (size.height <=
 (1<<20)) may be false. Note: “OpenCV CV_Assert is not an assertion (C-like
 assert()), it is regular C++ exception which can raised in case of invalid
 or non-supported parameters.”
