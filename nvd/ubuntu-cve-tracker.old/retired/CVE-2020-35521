Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> various sources, including upstream, seem to indicate that the
 ccdm94> patch for this issue is the same as the patch for CVE-2020-35522.
 ccdm94> No patches addressing CVE-2020-35521 specifically were found, and
 ccdm94> the upstream changelog indicates that commit b5a935d96b is fixing
 ccdm94> more than one issue, both being most likely closely related. No
 ccdm94> reproducers or stack traces involving this vulnerability were
 ccdm94> found, and the issue links (207 and 209) seem to not exist anymore. 
 ccdm94> Therefore, releases that have been patched for CVE-2020-35522 will
 ccdm94> be considered to have been patched for CVE-2020-35521 as well, as 
 ccdm94> the only sources of information indicate that the patch for both
 ccdm94> issues is the same.
