Description:
 A flaw was found in the permissions of a log file created by kexec-tools.
 This flaw allows a local unprivileged user to read this file and leak
 kernel internal information from a previous panic. The highest threat from
 this vulnerability is to confidentiality. This flaw affects kexec-tools
 shipped by Fedora versions prior to 2.0.21-8 and RHEL versions prior to
 2.0.20-47.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> on ubuntu/debian, makedumpfile from src:makedumpfile is used
   to create the dmesg file, and correctly limits the permissions on it.
   On Fedora/RedHat, the kdump-lib-initramfs.sh is used and is where
   the vulnerability lies. This script is not included in ubuntu/debian
   packaging.
