Description:
 A flaw was found in ansible-runner where the default temporary files
 configuration in ansible-2.0.0 are written to world R/W locations. This
 flaw allows an attacker to pre-create the directory, resulting in reading
 private information or forcing ansible-runner to write files as the
 legitimate user in a place they did not expect. The highest threat from
 this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.
