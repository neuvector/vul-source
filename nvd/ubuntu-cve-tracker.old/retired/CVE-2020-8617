Description:
 Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND
 server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or
 successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since
 BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose
 configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND
 servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and
 after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and
 deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would
 continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful
 results.
