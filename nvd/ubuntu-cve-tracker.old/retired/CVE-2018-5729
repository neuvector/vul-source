Description:

 principals to an LDAP Kerberos database to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference) or bypass a DN container check by supplying tagged
 data that is internal to the database module.

 It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled tagged data. A
 remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain
 sensitive information or cause a denial of service.
