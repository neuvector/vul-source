Description:
 Subversion's mod_dav_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption. While looking
 up path-based authorization rules, mod_dav_svn servers may attempt to use
 memory which has already been freed. Affected Subversion mod_dav_svn
 servers 1.10.0 through 1.14.1 (inclusive). Servers that do not use
 mod_dav_svn are not affected.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Thomas Weißschuh discovered that subversion servers did not properly
 handle memory in certain configurations. A remote attacker could potentially
 use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.
