Description:
 Improper access control in editor components of The Document Foundation
 LibreOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause
 external links to be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of
 LibreOffice documents that used "floating frames" linked to external files,
 would load the contents of those frames without prompting the user for
 permission to do so. This was inconsistent with the treatment of other
 linked content in LibreOffice. This issue affects: The Document Foundation
 LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to 7.4.7; 7.5 versions prior to 7.5.3.
