Description:
 Apport reads and writes information on a crashed process to /proc/pid with
 elevated privileges. Apport then determines which user the crashed process
 belongs to by reading /proc/pid through get_pid_info() in data/apport. An
 unprivileged user could exploit this to read information about a privileged
 running process by exploiting PID recycling. This information could then be
 used to obtain ASLR offsets for a process with an existing memory
 corruption vulnerability. The initial fix introduced regressions in the
 Python Apport library due to a missing argument in Report.add_proc_environ
 in apport/report.py. It also caused an autopkgtest failure when reading
 /proc/pid and with Python 2 compatibility by reading /proc maps. The
 initial and subsequent regression fixes are in 2.20.11-0ubuntu16,
 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.6, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.12, 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.22 and
 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29+esm3.
