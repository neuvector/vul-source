Description:
 An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in
 QEMU. The qxl_phys2virt() function does not check the size of the structure
 pointed to by the guest physical address, potentially reading past the end
 of the bar space into adjacent pages. A malicious guest user could use this
 flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host causing a denial of service
 condition.
