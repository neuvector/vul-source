Description:
 Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4 allows a trusted peer to perform
 Denial of Service by consuming all available CPU cycles during handling of
 a crafted Cache Digest response message. This only occurs when cache_peer
 is used with the cache digests feature. The problem exists because
 peerDigestHandleReply() livelocking in peer_digest.cc mishandles EOF.
