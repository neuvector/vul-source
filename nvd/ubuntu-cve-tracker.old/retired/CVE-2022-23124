Description:
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
 information on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not
 required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
 get_finderinfo method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
 of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an
 allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other
 vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was
 ZDI-CAN-15870.
