Description:
 Blueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. In Blueman before 2.1.4, the
 DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to
 an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on the
 system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than
 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for
 version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the
 `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel
 group in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On
 systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to
 `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an
 interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and
 without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by
 passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in
 2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ
 network object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to
 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-support
 is enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to
 users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in
 /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.

Notes:
 alexmurray| blueman should use polkit for authorisation but due to a packaging
  bug in Debian and Ubuntu this was not enabled
