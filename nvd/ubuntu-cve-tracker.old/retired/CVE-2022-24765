Description:
 Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This
 vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted
 parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties
 could create the folder `C:\.git`, which would be picked up by Git
 operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git
 directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git
 Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users
 who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users
 of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project
 would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\.git\config`.
 Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git
 Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable
 to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands
 are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround.
 Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the
 _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\Users` if the user profile
 is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.
