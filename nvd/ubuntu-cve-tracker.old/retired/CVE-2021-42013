Description:
 It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50
 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs
 to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If
 files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default
 configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI
 scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for
 remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache
 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.
