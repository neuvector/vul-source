Description:
 An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the trapper command
 functionality of Zabbix Server 2.4.X. A specially crafted set of packets
 can cause a command injection resulting in remote code execution. An
 attacker can make requests from an active Zabbix Proxy to trigger this
 vulnerability.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Zabbix incorrectly handled certain requests. A remote
 attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.
