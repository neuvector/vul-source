Description:
 Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows
 HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input
 into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline
 character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive
 clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an
 isolated CR or an isolated LF.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that JRuby mishandled newline characters in HTTP response
 headers. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to display malicious
 content to HTTP clients.
