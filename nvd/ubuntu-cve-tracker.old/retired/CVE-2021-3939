Description:
 Ubuntu-specific modifications to accountsservice (in patch file
 debian/patches/0010-set-language.patch) caused the fallback_locale
 variable, pointing to static storage, to be freed, in the
 user_change_language_authorized_cb function. This is reachable via the
 SetLanguage dbus function. This is fixed in versions
 0.6.55-0ubuntu12~20.04.5, 0.6.55-0ubuntu13.3, 0.6.55-0ubuntu14.1.
