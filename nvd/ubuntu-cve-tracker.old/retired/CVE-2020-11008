Description:
 Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked
 into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. This
 bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug
 still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked
 (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external "credential
 helper" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from
 secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs
 that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can
 cause Git to send a "blank" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and
 protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL,
 and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to
 an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a
 malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather
 suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically
 clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package
 systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which
 should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to
 exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use.
 Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's
 "store" helper - Git's "cache" helper - the "osxkeychain" helper that ships
 in Git's "contrib" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe
 even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows
 Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.
