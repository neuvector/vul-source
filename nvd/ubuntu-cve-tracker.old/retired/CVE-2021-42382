Description:
 A use-after-free in Busybox's awk applet leads to denial of service and
 possibly code execution when processing a crafted awk pattern in the
 getvar_s function
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> fix (importing awk.c from busybox version >= 1.34.0 due to large  
 ccdm94> amount of changes made to the awk.c code) introduces a regression 
 ccdm94> to busybox awk in xenial and earlier. Applying changes from the 
 ccdm94> commit which prevents this regression from happening (237bedd499c)  
 ccdm94> could result in further regressions being introduced to other 
 ccdm94> applets in busybox. This happens because interfaces for applets
 ccdm94> are altered in this commit, and the calls to get them executed
 ccdm94> through busybox are modified. External applications which use
 ccdm94> busybox could end up with regressions as well because of this.
