Description:
 The SMTP client in Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0.5 BETA, 1.0.7, and possibly
 other versions, does not notify users when it cannot establish a secure
 channel with the server, which allows remote attackers to obtain
 authentication information without detection via a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
 attack that bypasses TLS authentication or downgrades CRAM-MD5
 authentication to plain authentication.
