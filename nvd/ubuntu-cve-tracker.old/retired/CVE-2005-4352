Description:
 The securelevels implementation in NetBSD 2.1 and earlier, and Linux 2.6.15
 and earlier, allows local users to bypass time setting restrictions and set
 the clock backwards by setting the clock ahead to the maximum unixtime
 value (19 Jan 2038), which then wraps around to the minimum value (13 Dec
 1901), which can then be set ahead to the desired time, aka "settimeofday()
 time wrap."
