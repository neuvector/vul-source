Description:
 Puma is a HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. Prior to versions
 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header
 values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling.
 A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send
 a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this
 behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If
 the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request
 in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's
 body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the
 second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the
 proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request
 for a different client, the second response from the first client will be
 sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and
 4.3.9. As a workaround, do not use Apache Traffic Server with `puma`.
