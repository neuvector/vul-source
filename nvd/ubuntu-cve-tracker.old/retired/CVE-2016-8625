 https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102K.html

 curl before version 7.51.0 uses outdated IDNA 2003 standard to handle
 International Domain Names and this may lead users to potentially and
 unknowingly issue network transfer requests to the wrong host.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> upstream patch switched from libidn to libidn2 and may be
 mdeslaur> causing issues, see:
 mdeslaur> https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2016-11/0033.html
 mdeslaur> http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/333
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Fixing this is intrusive and is likely to cause regressions in
 mdeslaur> stable releases. As such, we will not be fixing this issue in
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and earlier.
