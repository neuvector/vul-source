Description:
 A denial of service vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in the way libcurl
 provides several different backends for resolving host names, selected at
 build time. If it is built to use the synchronous resolver, it allows name
 resolves to time-out slow operations using `alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`.
 When doing this, libcurl used a global buffer that was not mutex protected
 and a multi-threaded application might therefore crash or otherwise
 misbehave.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu is not vulnerable to this issue as packages are built
 mdeslaur> with the threaded resolver, not the synchronous resolver.
