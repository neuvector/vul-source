Description:
 Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software
 containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting
 to copy files using `docker cp` into a specially-crafted container can
 result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host’s
 filesystem, widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow
 files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating
 process. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users
 should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers do
 not need to be restarted.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Lei Wang and Ruizhi Xiao discovered that the Moby Docker engine
 subsystem in Docker incorrectly allowed the docker cp command to
 make permissions changes in the host filesystem in some situations. A
 local attacker could possibly use to this to expose sensitive
 information or gain administrative privileges.
