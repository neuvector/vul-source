Description:
 A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A
 complete lack of validation of attacker-controlled parameters can lead to a
 buffer over read. The results of the over read are then written back to the
 guest virtual machine memory. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker
 in a virtual machine to read significant amounts of host memory. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and
 system availability.
