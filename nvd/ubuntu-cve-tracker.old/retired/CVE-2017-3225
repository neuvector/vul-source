Description:
 Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an
 AES encrypted file. For devices utilizing this environment encryption mode,
 U-Boot's use of a zero initialization vector may allow attacks against the
 underlying cryptographic implementation and allow an attacker to decrypt
 the data. Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature uses a zero (0)
 initialization vector. This allows an attacker to perform dictionary
 attacks on encrypted data produced by Das U-Boot to learn information about
 the encrypted data.
