Description:
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
 affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to
 exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
 setfilparams function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
 of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length
 stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute
 code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-15837.
