Description:
 slapd in OpenLDAP 2.4.45 and earlier creates a PID file after dropping
 privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill
 arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for PID
 file modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname`"
 command, as demonstrated by openldap-initscript.
