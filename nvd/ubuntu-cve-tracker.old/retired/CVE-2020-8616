Description:
 A malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effective
 limitation on the number of fetches performed when processing referrals
 can, through the use of specially crafted referrals, cause a recursing
 server to issue a very large number of fetches in an attempt to process the
 referral. This has at least two potential effects: The performance of the
 recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional work
 required to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit this
 behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack
 with a high amplification factor.
