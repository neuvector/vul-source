Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's
 ReadTIM2ImageData() function in coders/tim2.c. A local attacker could trick
 the user in opening specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds
 read error, allowing an application to crash, resulting in a denial of
 service.
