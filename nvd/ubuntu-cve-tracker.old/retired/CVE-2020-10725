Description:
 A flaw was found in DPDK version 19.11 and above that allows a malicious
 guest to cause a segmentation fault of the vhost-user backend application
 running on the host, which could result in a loss of connectivity for the
 other guests running on that host. This is caused by a missing validity
 check of the descriptor address in the function
 `virtio_dev_rx_batch_packed()`.
