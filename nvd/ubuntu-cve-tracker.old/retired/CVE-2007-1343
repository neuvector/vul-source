Description:
 includes/functions.php in Craig Knudsen WebCalendar before 1.0.5 does not
 protect the noSet variable from external modification, which allows remote
 attackers to set arbitrary global variables via a URL with modified values
 in the noSet parameter, which leads to resultant vulnerabilities that
 probably include remote file inclusion and other issues.
