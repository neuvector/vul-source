Description:
 A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with
 Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
 where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses
 outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is
 not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an
 open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows
 an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other
 systems.
