Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Dnsmasq 2.86 has a heap-based buffer overflow in
 resize_packet (called from FuzzResizePacket and fuzz_rfc1035.c) because of
 the lack of a proper bounds check upon pseudo header re-insertion. NOTE:
 the vendor's position is that CVE-2021-45951 through CVE-2021-45957 "do not
 represent real vulnerabilities, to the best of our knowledge." However, a
 contributor states that a security patch (mentioned in 016162.html) is
 needed.
