Description:
 A Node.js application that allows an attacker to trigger a DNS request for
 a host of their choice could trigger a Denial of Service in versions <
 15.2.1, < 14.15.1, and < 12.19.1 by getting the application to resolve a
 DNS record with a larger number of responses. This is fixed in 15.2.1,
 14.15.1, and 12.19.1.
