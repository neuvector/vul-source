Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation
 vulnerability. A low-privileged OS user with access to a Windows host where
 Cacti is installed can create arbitrary PHP files in a web document
 directory. The user can then execute the PHP files under the security
 context of SYSTEM. This allows an attacker to escalate privilege from a
 normal user account to SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version
 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
 this vulnerability.
