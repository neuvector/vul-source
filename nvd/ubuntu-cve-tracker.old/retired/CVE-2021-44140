Description:
 Remote attackers may delete arbitrary files in a system hosting a JSPWiki
 instance, versions up to 2.11.0.M8, by using a carefuly crafted http
 request on logout, given that those files are reachable to the user running
 the JSPWiki instance. Apache JSPWiki users should upgrade to 2.11.0 or
 later.
