Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.16, 3.0 before 3.0.10, and
 3.1 before 3.1.1 (when Python 3.7+ is used). The intermediate-level
 directories of the filesystem cache had the system's standard umask rather
 than 0o077.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> This issue is caused by a behavioural change in Python 3.7.
 mdeslaur> While python3.7 is available for bionic, it doesn't replace
 mdeslaur> python3.6, so bionic is not affected by this issue.
