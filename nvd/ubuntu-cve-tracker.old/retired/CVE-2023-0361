Description:
 A timing side-channel in the handling of RSA ClientKeyExchange messages was
 discovered in GnuTLS. This side-channel can be sufficient to recover the
 key encrypted in the RSA ciphertext across a network in a Bleichenbacher
 style attack. To achieve a successful decryption the attacker would need to
 send a large amount of specially crafted messages to the vulnerable server.
 By recovering the secret from the ClientKeyExchange message, the attacker
 would be able to decrypt the application data exchanged over that
 connection.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> bionic already contains a sidechannel in RSA decryption because
 mdeslaur> CVE-2018-16868 is not fixed due to it being too intrusive. We
 mdeslaur> will ignore this CVE for bionic and earlier also.
