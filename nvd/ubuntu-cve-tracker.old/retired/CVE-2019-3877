Description:
 A vulnerability was found in mod_auth_mellon before v0.14.2. An open
 redirect in the logout URL allows requests with backslashes to pass through
 by assuming that it is a relative URL, while the browsers silently convert
 backslash characters into forward slashes treating them as an absolute URL.
 This mismatch allows an attacker to bypass the redirect URL validation
 logic in apr_uri_parse function.
