Description:
 MaraDNS is open-source software that implements the Domain Name System
 (DNS). In version 3.5.0024 and prior, a remotely exploitable integer
 underflow vulnerability in the DNS packet decompression function allows an
 attacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an abnormal program
 termination. The vulnerability exists in the `decomp_get_rddata` function
 within the `Decompress.c` file. When handling a DNS packet with an Answer
 RR of qtype 16 (TXT record) and any qclass, if the `rdlength` is smaller
 than `rdata`, the result of the line `Decompress.c:886` is a negative
 number `len = rdlength - total;`. This value is then passed to the
 `decomp_append_bytes` function without proper validation, causing the
 program to attempt to allocate a massive chunk of memory that is impossible
 to allocate. Consequently, the program exits with an error code of 64,
 causing a Denial of Service. One proposed fix for this vulnerability is to
 patch `Decompress.c:887` by breaking `if(len <= 0)`, which has been
 incorporated in version 3.5.0036 via commit
 bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58.
