Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to
 incorrect parser validation, it allows a Denial of Service attack against
 the Cache Manager API. This allows a trusted client to trigger memory leaks
 that. over time, lead to a Denial of Service via an unspecified short query
 string. This attack is limited to clients with Cache Manager API access
 privilege.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> this issue only affects the Cache Manager, which is usually
 mdeslaur> restricted to trusted clients only.
 mdeslaur> The patch is intrusive to backport to 3.x versions, so we will
 mdeslaur> not be fixing this issue in older releases. We recommend setting
 mdeslaur> appropriate access control to limit connections from trusted
 mdeslaur> clients.
