 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles contextlib2
 mdeslaur> binaries when built. After updating contextlib2, a no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, contextlib2 is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
