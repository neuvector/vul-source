Notes: 
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-colorama binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-colorama, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-colorama is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
