Notes: 
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-cachecontrol binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-cachecontrol, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is
 mdeslaur> required. On jammy and later, python-cachecontrol is bundled in
 mdeslaur> the python-pip package and needs to be patched.
