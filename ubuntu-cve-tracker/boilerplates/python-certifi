Notes: 
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-certifi binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-certifi, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-certifi is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> In Debian and Ubuntu, the python-certifi packages are patched to
 mdeslaur> return the location of the system CA certs provided by the
 mdeslaur> ca-certificates package. While the source and binary packages do
 mdeslaur> contain the ca certificates, they are not used by anything.
