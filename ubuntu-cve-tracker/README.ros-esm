ROS ESM
-------------------------
The Robotics team maintains the ROS (Robot Operating System) ESM as a separate service from regular ESM. For more details on ROS ESM, you can visit its wiki page: https://wiki.canonical.com/UbuntuEngineering/Security/ROS-ESM/ 

Currently, ROS ESM supports two distros: ROS Kinetic, for Ubuntu Xenial, and ROS Melodic, for Ubuntu Bionic.

To determine the package youâ€™re working on is a ROS ESM package, please refer to the list of supported packages for ROS Kinetic ('ros-esm-xenial-kinetic-supported.txt'), ROS Melodic ('ros-esm-bionic-melodic-supported.txt'), ROS Noetic ('ros-esm-focal-noetic-supported.txt'), and ROS 2 Foxy ('ros-esm-focal-foxy-supported.txt').

How to proceed?

If a CVE affects a ROS ESM package, just notify the Robotics team via Mattermost (https://chat.canonical.com/canonical/channels/robotics), and leave its status as 'needs-triage'.
