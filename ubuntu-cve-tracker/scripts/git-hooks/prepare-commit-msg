# git prepare-commit-msg hook
# Sadly, on git merge, the pre-commit hook is not invoked. So we use
# this hook instead to check if a merge has borked cve syntax.
# Unfortunately, if the hook fails, then you are left in an incomplete
# merge state.

    # elsewhere for regular commits *and* it's handled more cleanly
