Description:
 The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading
 the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original
 file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the
 callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the
 manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege
 escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has
 privileged access. Note: This attack requires local system access and only
 affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.2 and Firefox < 54.
