Description:
 If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to
 the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER
 attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the
 referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block
 remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the
 composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional
 capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for
 CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This
 vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.
