Description:
 Exim SMTP Challenge Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of Exim. Authentication is not
 required to exploit this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the handling of NTLM challenge requests.
 The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of
 user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based
 buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the
 context of the service account.
 . Was ZDI-CAN-17515.
