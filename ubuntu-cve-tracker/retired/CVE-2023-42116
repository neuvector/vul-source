Description:
 Exim SMTP Challenge Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of Exim. Authentication is not
 required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
 handling of NTLM challenge requests. The issue results from the lack of
 proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it
 to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
 vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was
 ZDI-CAN-17515.
