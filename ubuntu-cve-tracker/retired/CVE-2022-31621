Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of
 Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_xbstream.cc, when an error occurs
 (stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL) while executing the method xbstream_open,
 the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to
 trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues
 this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse
 effects.
