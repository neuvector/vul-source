Description:
 When curl is instructed to get content using the metalink feature, and a
 user name and password are used to download the metalink XML file, those
 same credentials are then subsequently passed on to each of the servers
 from which curl will download or try to download the contents from. Often
 contrary to the user's expectations and intentions and without telling the
 user it happened.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> introduced in 7.27.0
 mdeslaur> per upstream "curl has completely removed the metalink feature
 mdeslaur> as of 7.78.0. No fix for this flaw will be produced by the curl
 mdeslaur> project. The fix for earlier versions is to rebuild curl
 mdeslaur> with the metalink support switched off!"
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu builds curl with metalink support switched off already.
