 https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/e9f395e77afee5490b5ae9a677231e2f7072e72c
Description:
 Node.js depends on multiple built-in utility functions to normalize paths
 provided to node:fs functions, which can be overwitten with user-defined
 implementations leading to filesystem permission model bypass through path
 traversal attack. This vulnerability affects all users using the
 experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21. Please note
 that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an
 experimental feature of Node.js.
