Description:
 librsvg before 2.34.1 uses the node name to identify the type of node,
 which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a SVG file
 with a node with the element name starting with "fe," which is
 misidentified as a RsvgFilterPrimitive.
