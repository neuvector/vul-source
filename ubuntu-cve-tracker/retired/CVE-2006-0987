Description:
 The default configuration of ISC BIND before 9.4.1-P1, when configured as a
 caching name server, allows recursive queries and provides additional
 delegation information to arbitrary IP addresses, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via DNS
 queries with spoofed source IP addresses.
