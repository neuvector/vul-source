Description:
 Buffer overflow in UnZip 5.50 and earlier allows user-assisted attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a long filename command line argument.  NOTE:
 since the overflow occurs in a non-setuid program, there are not many
 scenarios under which it poses a vulnerability, unless unzip is passed long
 arguments when it is invoked from other programs.
