Description:
 The HTMLMediaElement::loadResource function in html/HTMLMediaElement.cpp in
 WebCore in WebKit before r49480, as used in Apple Safari before 4.0.4 on
 Mac OS X, does not perform the expected callbacks for HTML 5 media elements
 that have external URLs for media resources, which allows remote attackers
 to trigger sub-resource requests to arbitrary web sites via a crafted HTML
 document, as demonstrated by an HTML e-mail message that uses a media
 element for X-Confirm-Reading-To functionality, aka rdar problem 7271202.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from
  it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit
