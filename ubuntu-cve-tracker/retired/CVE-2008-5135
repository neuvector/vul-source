Description:
 os-prober in os-prober 1.17 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files
 via a symlink attack on the (1) /tmp/mounted-map or (2) /tmp/raided-map
 temporary file.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating "the
 insecure code path should only ever run inside a d-i environment, which has
 no non-root users.
