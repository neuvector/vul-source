Description:
 The cabd_extract function in cabd.c in libmspack before 0.5 does not
 properly maintain decompression callbacks in certain cases where an invalid
 file follows a valid file, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted
 CAB archive.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that cabextract incorrectly handled certain malformed CAB
 files. An attacker could use this issue to cause cabextract to crash,
 resulting in a denial of service.
