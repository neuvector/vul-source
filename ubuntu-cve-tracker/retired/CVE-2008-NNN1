Notes: 
 jdstrand> dapper - feisty doesn't use have 'Leave message' enabled
 jdstrand> I couldn't reproduce this-- putting a large amount of text doesn't
  crash gnome-screensaver-- only makes it 'hang' after which it works fine
 jdstrand> seems to be OOM local DoS only.  In gs-lock-plug.c submit_note()
   gnome-screensaver uses gtk_* functions for dealing with the note text, so
   no overrun potential. Could invoke OOM killer with disabling swap and using
   large amount of text
