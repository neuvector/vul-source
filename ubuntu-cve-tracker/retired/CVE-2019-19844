Description:
 Django before 1.11.27, 2.x before 2.2.9, and 3.x before 3.0.1 allows
 account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an
 existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode
 characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for
 the matched user account. (One mitigation in the new releases is to send
 password reset tokens only to the registered user email address.)
