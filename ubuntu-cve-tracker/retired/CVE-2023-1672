Description:
 A race condition exists in the Tang server functionality for key generation
 and key rotation. This flaw results in a small time window where Tang
 private keys become readable by other processes on the same host.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> For tang 6 and 7 in bionic and focal respectively, the code
  from src/keys.c and src/tangd-rotate-keys.in is not present, however there
  is an equivalent src/tangd-keygen script which looks like it needs to be
  updated to set the umask correctly
