Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** jackson-databind through 2.15.2 allows attackers to cause a
 denial of service or other unspecified impact via a crafted object that
 uses cyclic dependencies. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that this is
 not a valid vulnerability report, because the steps of constructing a
 cyclic data structure and trying to serialize it cannot be achieved by an
 external attacker.
