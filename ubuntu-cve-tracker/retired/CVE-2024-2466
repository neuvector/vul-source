Description:
 libcurl did not check the server certificate of TLS connections done to a
 host specified as an IP address, when built to use mbedTLS. libcurl would
 wrongly avoid using the set hostname function when the specified hostname
 was given as an IP address, therefore completely skipping the certificate
 check. This affects all uses of TLS protocols (HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POPS3,
 SMTPS, etc).
