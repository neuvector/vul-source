Description:
 Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of a
 file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data
 without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk
 into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing
 buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending
 crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU
 time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests.
 This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.1.
