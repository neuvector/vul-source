Description:
 istream.c in w3m 0.5.2 and possibly other versions, when ssl_verify_server
 is enabled, does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in
 the (1) subject's Common Name or (2) Subject Alternative Name field of an
 X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
 arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
 Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
