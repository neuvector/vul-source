Description:
 urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Starting in
 version 2.2.0 and prior to 2.5.0, urllib3 does not control redirects in
 browsers and Node.js. urllib3 supports being used in a Pyodide runtime
 utilizing the JavaScript Fetch API or falling back on XMLHttpRequest. This
 means Python libraries can be used to make HTTP requests from a browser or
 Node.js. Additionally, urllib3 provides a mechanism to control redirects,
 but the retries and redirect parameters are ignored with Pyodide; the
 runtime itself determines redirect behavior. This issue has been patched in
 version 2.5.0.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 hlibk> Issue is specific to Emscripten, support for which was added in
  version 2.2.0
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3 binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-urllib3 is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
