Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> as of 2021-02-24, no upstream fix
 sbeattie> likely fixed in upstream 4.0.7 release
 sbeattie> reproducer in oss-security post
 ccdm94> bionic and later are not-affected and the issue
 ccdm94> is not reproducible in trusty (no huge reallocs
 ccdm94> are made, as would be expected), and is also
 ccdm94> not reproducible in xenial (no reallocs made
 ccdm94> at all, according to ltrace output) with the
 ccdm94> POC file provided in the oss-security post.
 ccdm94> No upstream patch was identified after analysis
 ccdm94> of the libtiff changelog file, as well as the
 ccdm94> change history for the tiffdither code. Since
 ccdm94> this is a 2015 issue, trusty and xenial will
 ccdm94> be marked as ignored.
