Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue discovered in XZ 5.2.5 allows attackers to cause a
 denial of service via decompression of a crafted file. NOTE: the vendor
 disputes the claims of "endless output" and "denial of service" because
 decompression of the 17,486 bytes always results in 114,881,179 bytes,
 which is often a reasonable size increase.
