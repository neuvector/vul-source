Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial of
 service via a special request. NOTE: The discoverer reports "Trustwave has
 signaled they are disputing our claims." The CVE suggests that there is a
 security issue with how ModSecurity handles regular expressions that can
 result in a Denial of Service condition. The vendor does not consider this
 as a security issue because1) there is no default configuration issue here.
 An attacker would need to know that a rule using a potentially problematic
 regular expression was in place, 2) the attacker would need to know the
 basic nature of the regular expression itself to exploit any resource
 issues. It's well known that regular expression usage can be taxing on
 system resources regardless of the use case. It is up to the administrator
 to decide on when it is appropriate to trade resources for potential
 security benefit.
