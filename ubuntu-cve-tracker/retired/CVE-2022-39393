Description:
 Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2,
 there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance
 allocator where when a linear memory is reused for another instance the
 initial heap snapshot of the prior instance can be visible, erroneously to
 the next instance. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to
 Wasmtime 2.0.2. Other mitigations include disabling the pooling allocator
 and disabling the `memory-init-cow`.
