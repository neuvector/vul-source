Description:
 Red Hat libvirt 0.2.0 through 0.8.2 creates iptables rules with improper
 mappings of privileged source ports, which allows guest OS users to bypass
 intended access restrictions by leveraging IP address and source-port
 values, as demonstrated by copying and deleting an NFS directory tree.
