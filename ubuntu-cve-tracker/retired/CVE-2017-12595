Description:
 The tokenizer in QPDF 6.0.0 and 7.0.b1 is recursive for arrays and
 dictionaries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (stack consumption and segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a PDF document with a deep data structure, as demonstrated
 by a crash in QPDFObjectHandle::parseInternal in
 libqpdf/QPDFObjectHandle.cc.
