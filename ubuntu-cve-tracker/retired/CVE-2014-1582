Description:
 The Public Key Pinning (PKP) implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0
 does not properly consider the connection-coalescing behavior of SPDY and
 HTTP/2 in the case of a shared IP address, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to bypass an intended pinning configuration and spoof a web site
 by providing a valid certificate from an arbitrary recognized Certification
 Authority.
