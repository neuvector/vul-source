Description:
 pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping,
 and transforming the pages of PDF files. An attacker who uses this
 vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to unexpected long runtime. This
 quadratic runtime blocks the current process and can utilize a single core
 of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. This issue has been
 addressed in PR 808 and versions from 1.27.9 include this fix. Users are 
 advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
