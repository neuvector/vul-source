Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** svm_predict_values in svm.cpp in Libsvm v324, as used in
 scikit-learn 0.23.2 and other products, allows attackers to cause a denial
 of service (segmentation fault) via a crafted model SVM (introduced via
 pickle, json, or any other model permanence standard) with a large value in
 the _n_support array. NOTE: the scikit-learn vendor's position is that the
 behavior can only occur if the library's API is violated by an application
 that changes a private attribute.
