Description:
 Improper isolation of shared resources in some Intel(R) Processors may
 allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via
 local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Pietro Borrello, Andreas Kogler, Martin Schwarzl, Daniel Gruss, Michael
 Schwarz and Moritz Lipp discovered that some Intel processors did not
 properly clear data between subsequent xAPIC MMIO reads. This could allow a
 local attacker to compromise SGX enclaves.
Notes:
 sbeattie> Intel TA-00657
 sbeattie> only known impact is to compromise SGX
