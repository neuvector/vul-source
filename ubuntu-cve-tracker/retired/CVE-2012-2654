Description:
 The (1) EC2 and (2) OS APIs in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom (2012.2),
 Essex (2012.1), and Diablo (2011.3) do not properly check the protocol when
 security groups are created and the network protocol is not specified
 entirely in lowercase, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
 access restrictions.
