Description:
 The monitor component in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD
 platforms accepts extraneous username data in MONITOR_REQ_PAM_INIT_CTX
 requests, which allows local users to conduct impersonation attacks by
 leveraging any SSH login access in conjunction with control of the sshd uid
 to send a crafted MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request, related to monitor.c and
 monitor_wrap.c.
