Description:
 go-tuf is a Go implementation of The Update Framework (TUF). go-tuf does
 not correctly implement the client workflow for updating the metadata files
 for roles other than the root role. Specifically, checks for rollback
 attacks are not implemented correctly meaning an attacker can cause clients
 to install software that is older than the software which the client
 previously knew to be available, and may include software with known
 vulnerabilities. In more detail, the client code of go-tuf has several
 issues in regards to preventing rollback attacks: 1. It does not take into
 account the content of any previously trusted metadata, if available,
 before proceeding with updating roles other than the root role (i.e., steps
 5.4.3.1 and 5.5.5 of the detailed client workflow). This means that any
 form of version verification done on the newly-downloaded metadata is made
 using the default value of zero, which always passes. 2. For both timestamp
 and snapshot roles, go-tuf saves these metadata files as trusted before
 verifying if the version of the metafiles they refer to is correct (i.e.,
 steps 5.5.4 and 5.6.4 of the detailed client workflow). A fix is available
 in version 0.3.0 or newer. No workarounds are known for this issue apart
 from upgrading.
