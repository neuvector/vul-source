Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** scp in OpenSSH through 8.3p1 allows command injection in the
 scp.c toremote function, as demonstrated by backtick characters in the
 destination argument. NOTE: the vendor reportedly has stated that they
 intentionally omit validation of "anomalous argument transfers" because
 that could "stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> the upstream OpenSSH project will not be fixing this issue as
 mdeslaur> it may result in breaking existing workflows. As such, we will
 mdeslaur> not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu.
