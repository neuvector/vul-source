Description:
 The Snapweb interface before version 0.21.2 was exposing controls to
 install or remove snap packages without controlling the identity of the
 user, nor the origin of the connection. An attacker could have used the
 controls to remotely add a valid, but malicious, snap package, from the
 Store, potentially using system resources without permission from the
 legitimate administrator of the system.
