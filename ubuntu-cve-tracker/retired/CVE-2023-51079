Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A long execution time can occur in the
 ParseTools.subCompileExpression method in MVEL 2.5.0.Final because of many
 Java class lookups. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because "the only thing
 that you could expect is that the parser will take a crazy amount of time
 to complete its task."
