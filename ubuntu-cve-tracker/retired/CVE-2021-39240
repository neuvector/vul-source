Description:
 An issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before 2.3.13,
 and 2.4 before 2.4.3. It does not ensure that the scheme and path portions
 of a URI have the expected characters. For example, the authority field (as
 observed on a target HTTP/2 server) might differ from what the routing
 rules were intended to achieve.
