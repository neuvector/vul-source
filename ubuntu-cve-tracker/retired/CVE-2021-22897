Description:
 curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to wrong
 session due to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST when
 libcurl is built to use the Schannel TLS library. The selected cipher set
 was stored in a single "static" variable in the library, which has the
 surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent
 transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the
 set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport
 security significantly.
