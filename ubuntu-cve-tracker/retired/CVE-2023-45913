Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Mesa v23.0.4 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer
 dereference via the function dri2GetGlxDrawableFromXDrawableId(). This
 vulnerability is triggered when the X11 server sends an
 DRI2_BufferSwapComplete event unexpectedly when the application is using
 DRI3. NOTE: this is disputed because there is no scenario in which the
 vulnerability was demonstrated.
