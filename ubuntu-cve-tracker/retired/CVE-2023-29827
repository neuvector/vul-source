Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** ejs v3.1.9 is vulnerable to server-side template injection.
 If the ejs file is controllable, template injection can be implemented
 through the configuration settings of the closeDelimiter parameter. NOTE:
 this is disputed by the vendor because the render function is not intended
 to be used with untrusted input.
