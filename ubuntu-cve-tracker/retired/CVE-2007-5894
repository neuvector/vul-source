Candidate: CVE-2007-5894
References:
 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5894
Description:
 The reply function in ftpd.c in the gssftp ftpd in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5)
 does not initialize the length variable when auth_type has a certain value,
 which has unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors.  NOTE:
 the original disclosure misidentifies the conditions under which the
 uninitialized variable is used.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue,
 stating " The 'length' variable is only uninitialized if 'auth_type' is
 neither the 'KERBEROS_V4' nor 'GSSAPI'; this condition cannot occur in the
 unmodified source code.
