Description:
 A pointer overflow, with code execution, was discovered in ZeroMQ libzmq
 (aka 0MQ) 4.2.x and 4.3.x before 4.3.1. A v2_decoder.cpp
 zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready integer overflow allows an authenticated
 attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of bytes beyond the bounds of a
 buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the target system.
 The memory layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands into a data
 structure located immediately after the problematic buffer (i.e., it is not
 necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation technique that
 changes the flow of control).
