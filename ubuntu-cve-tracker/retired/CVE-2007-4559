 https://peps.python.org/pep-0706/
Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in the (1) extract and (2) extractall
 functions in the tarfile module in Python allows user-assisted remote
 attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) sequence in
 filenames in a TAR archive, a related issue to CVE-2001-1267.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> Upstream python eventually decided to fix this by adding an
 mdeslaur> additional option to the affected functions to specify adding a
 mdeslaur> filter. See PEP 706.
 mdeslaur> While this does not change the default behaviour, applications
 mdeslaur> modified to use the filter can now safely extract untrusted tar
 mdeslaur> files.
 mdeslaur> Due to the default not changing, we will not be fixing this
 mdeslaur> issue in older Python releases, marking as ignored.
