Description:
 A potentially exploitable crash in TransportSecurityInfo used for SSL can
 be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile
 directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another
 vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or
 from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable
 startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions
 of Firefox if the same profile is used. This vulnerability affects
 Thunderbird < 60.2.1, Firefox ESR < 60.2.1, and Firefox < 62.0.2.
