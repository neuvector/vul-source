Description:
 Arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability in Drupal Core under certain
 circumstances. An attacker could trick an administrator into visiting a
 malicious site that could result in creating a carefully named directory on
 the file system. With this directory in place, an attacker could attempt to
 brute force a remote code execution vulnerability. Windows servers are most
 likely to be affected. This issue affects: Drupal Drupal Core 8.8.x
 versions prior to 8.8.8; 8.9.x versions prior to 8.9.1; 9.0.1 versions
 prior to 9.0.1.
