Description:
 A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an
 attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution
 via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to
 add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> To exploit this, you would need to trick someone into restoring
 mdeslaur> a set of iptables rules from a malicious iptables-save file.
 mdeslaur> This is quite an unlikely scenario.
 mdeslaur> Reproducer doesn't work on xenial and bionic, like an issue
 mdeslaur> in 1.8.2 only.
