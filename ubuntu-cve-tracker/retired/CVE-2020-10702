Description:
 A flaw was found in QEMU in the implementation of the Pointer
 Authentication (PAuth) support for ARM introduced in version 4.0 and fixed
 in version 5.0.0. A general failure of the signature generation process
 caused every PAuth-enforced pointer to be signed with the same signature. A
 local attacker could obtain the signature of a protected pointer and abuse
 this flaw to bypass PAuth protection for all programs running on QEMU.
