Description:
 HTTP response smuggling vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird
 before 1.5.0.4, when used with certain proxy servers, allows remote
 attackers to cause Firefox to interpret certain responses as if they were
 responses from two different sites via (1) invalid HTTP response headers
 with spaces between the header name and the colon, which might not be
 ignored in some cases, or (2) HTTP 1.1 headers through an HTTP 1.0 proxy,
 which are ignored by the proxy but processed by the client.
