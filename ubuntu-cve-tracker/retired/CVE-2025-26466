Description:
 A flaw was found in the OpenSSH package. For each ping packet the SSH
 server receives, a pong packet is allocated in a memory buffer and stored
 in a queue of packages. It is only freed when the server/client key
 exchange has finished. A malicious client may keep sending such packages,
 leading to an uncontrolled increase in memory consumption on the server
 side. Consequently, the server may become unavailable, resulting in a
 denial of service attack.
