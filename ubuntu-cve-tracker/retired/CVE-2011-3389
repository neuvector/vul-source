Description:
 The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows
 and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and
 other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization
 vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP
 headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session,
 in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API,
 (2) the Java URLConnection API, or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a
 "BEAST" attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered that the block-wise AES
 encryption algorithm block-wise as used in TLS/SSL was vulnerable
 to a chosen-plaintext attack. This could allow a remote attacker to
 view confidential data.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> in natty+, NetX and the plugin moved to the icedtea-web package
 jdstrand> this is not a lighttpd issue, however dsa-2368 disabled CBC ciphers
  by default. Ignoring as this is a configuration issue.
 sbeattie> openssl contains a countermeasure since openssl 0.9.8d,
  though it can be disabled with the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS
  option (which is included in SSL_OP_ALL). Need to search through
  openssl user that enable the option.
 tyhicks> All versions of gnutls in supported releases have TLS 1.1 and 1.2
  support. TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are not affected by this attack. Upstream advised
  applications to use 1.1 and 1.2 in GNUTLS-SA-2011-1. Additionally, DTLS 1.0
  can be used or RC4 can be used with TLS 1.0 if TLS 1.1 or 1.2 are not viable
  options.
 jdstrand> arcticdog blog points out that users of SSL_OP_ALL should be updated
  to use 'SSL_OP_ALL & ~SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS' to not be
  vulnerable to this attack
 mdeslaur> removing SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS will break
  compatibility with certain SSL implementations, which is why it's
  included in SSL_OP_ALL in the first place. Since the BEAST attack is only
  practical in web browsers where you can run arbitrary code, and current
  web browsers are already fixed, modifying other software in the archive
  to enable the work around will break compatibility with no added security
  benefit.
