Description:
 libcurl supports *pinning* of the server certificate public key for HTTPS
 transfers. Due to an omission, this check is not performed when connecting
 with QUIC for HTTP/3, when the TLS backend is wolfSSL. Documentation says
 the option works with wolfSSL, failing to specify that it does not for QUIC
 and HTTP/3. Since pinning makes the transfer succeed if the pin is fine,
 users could unwittingly connect to an impostor server without noticing.

Notes:
