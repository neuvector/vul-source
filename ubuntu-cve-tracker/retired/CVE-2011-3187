Description:
 The to_s method in actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb
 in Ruby on Rails 3.0.5 does not validate the X-Forwarded-For header in
 requests from IP addresses on a Class C network, which might allow remote
 attackers to inject arbitrary text into log files or bypass intended
 address parsing via a crafted header.
