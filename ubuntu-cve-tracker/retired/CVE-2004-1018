Description:
 Multiple integer handling errors in PHP before 4.3.10 allow attackers to
 bypass safe mode restrictions, cause a denial of service, or execute
 arbitrary code via (1) a negative offset value to the shmop_write function,
 (2) an "integer overflow/underflow" in the pack function, or (3) an
 "integer overflow/underflow" in the unpack function.  NOTE: this issue was
 originally REJECTed by its CNA before publication, but that decision is in
 active dispute.  This candidate may change significantly in the future as a
 result of further discussion.
