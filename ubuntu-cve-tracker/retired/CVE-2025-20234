Description:
 A vulnerability in Universal Disk Format (UDF) processing of ClamAV could
 allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
 (DoS) condition on an affected device.
 
 This vulnerability is due to a memory overread during UDF file scanning. An
 attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file
 containing UDF content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A
 successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate the ClamAV
 scanning process, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software.
 For a description of this vulnerability, see the .
