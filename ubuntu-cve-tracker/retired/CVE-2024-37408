Description:
 fprintd through 1.94.3 lacks a security attention mechanism, and thus
 unexpected actions might be authorized by "auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so"
 for Sudo. NOTE: the supplier disputes this because they believe issue
 resolution would involve modifying the PAM configuration to restrict
 pam_fprintd.so to front-ends that implement a proper attention mechanism,
 not modifying pam_fprintd.so or fprintd.
