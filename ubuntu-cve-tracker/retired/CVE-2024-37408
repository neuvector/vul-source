Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** fprintd through 1.94.3 lacks a security attention mechanism,
 and thus unexpected actions might be authorized by "auth sufficient
 pam_fprintd.so" for Sudo. NOTE: the supplier disputes this because they
 believe issue resolution would involve modifying the PAM configuration to
 restrict pam_fprintd.so to front-ends that implement a proper attention
 mechanism, not modifying pam_fprintd.so or fprintd.
