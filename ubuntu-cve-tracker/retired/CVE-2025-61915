Description:
 OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other
 Unix-like operating systems. Prior to version 2.4.15, a user in the lpadmin
 group can use the cups web ui to change the config and insert a malicious
 line. Then the cupsd process which runs as root will parse the new config
 and cause an out-of-bound write. This issue has been patched in version
 2.4.15.
