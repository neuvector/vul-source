Description:
 An integer overflow was found in QEMU 4.0.1 through 4.2.0 in the way it
 implemented ATI VGA emulation. This flaw occurs in the ati_2d_blt() routine
 in hw/display/ati-2d.c while handling MMIO write operations through the
 ati_mm_write() callback. A malicious guest could abuse this flaw to crash
 the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service.
