Description:
 In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.2 and before 3.12.3, if an application using
 Puma allows untrusted input in a response header, an attacker can use
 newline characters (i.e. `CR`, `LF` or`/r`, `/n`) to end the header and
 inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new
 response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting.
 While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several
 other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to
 CVE-2019-16254, which fixed this vulnerability for the WEBrick Ruby web
 server. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking all
 headers for line endings and rejecting headers with those characters.
