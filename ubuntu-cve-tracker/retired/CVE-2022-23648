Description:
 containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and
 Windows. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and
 1.14.12 where containers launched through containerd’s CRI implementation
 on Linux with a specially-crafted image configuration could gain access to
 read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host. This may
 bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a
 Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive
 information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use
 containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd
 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12. Users should update to these versions to resolve
 the issue.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that containerd allows attackers to gain access to read-only
 copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host via a specially-crafted
 image configuration. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain
 sensitive information.
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> While this was fixed in USN-5311-1, a subsequent SRU regressed
 mdeslaur> the security update.
