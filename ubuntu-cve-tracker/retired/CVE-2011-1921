Description:
 The mod_dav_svn module for the Apache HTTP Server, as distributed in Apache
 Subversion 1.5.x and 1.6.x before 1.6.17, when the SVNPathAuthz
 short_circuit option is disabled, does not properly enforce permissions for
 files that had been publicly readable in the past, which allows remote
 attackers to obtain sensitive information via a replay REPORT operation.
