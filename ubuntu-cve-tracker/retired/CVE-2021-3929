Description:
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME)
 emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it,
 when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(),
 data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious
 guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting
 in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code
 within the context of the QEMU process on the host.
