Description:
 When copying files with rsync, octorpki uses the "-a" flag 0, which forces
 rsync to copy binaries with the suid bit set as root. Since the provided
 service definition defaults to root (
 https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/blob/master/package/octorpki.service )
 this could allow for a vector, when combined with another vulnerability
 that causes octorpki to process a malicious TAL file, for a local privilege
 escalation.
