Description:
 OpenSSH on FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4, when used with OpenPAM, does not properly
 handle when a forked child process terminates during PAM authentication,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client
 connection refusal) by connecting multiple times to the SSH server, waiting
 for the password prompt, then disconnecting.
