Description:
 The MPEG4Extractor::parse3GPPMetaData function in MPEG4Extractor.cpp in
 libstagefright in Android before 5.1.1 LMY48I does not enforce a minimum
 size for UTF-16 strings containing a Byte Order Mark (BOM), which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer underflow, buffer
 over-read, and mediaserver process crash) via crafted 3GPP metadata, aka
 internal bug 20923261, a related issue to CVE-2015-3828.
