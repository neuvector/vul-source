Description:
 The accessibility-tools feature in Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 on OS X
 improperly interacts with the implementation of the TABLE element, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code by using an NSAccessibilityIndexAttribute
 value to reference a row index.
