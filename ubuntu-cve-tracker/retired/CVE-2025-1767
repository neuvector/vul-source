Description:
 This CVE only affects Kubernetes clusters that utilize the in-tree gitRepo
 volume to clone git repositories from other pods within the same node.
 Since the in-tree gitRepo volume feature has been deprecated and will not
 receive security updates upstream, any cluster still using this feature
 remains vulnerable.
