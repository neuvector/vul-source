Description:
 A missing allocation check in sftp server processing read requests may
 cause a NULL dereference on low-memory conditions. The malicious client can
 request up to 4GB SFTP reads, causing allocation of up to 4GB buffers,
 which was not being checked for failure. This will likely crash the
 authenticated user's sftp server connection (if implemented as forking as
 recommended). For thread-based servers, this might also cause DoS for
 legitimate users. Given this code is not in any released versions, no
 security releases have been issued.
