Description:
 libssh before 0.7.3 improperly truncates ephemeral secrets generated for
 the (1) diffie-hellman-group1 and (2) diffie-hellman-group14 key exchange
 methods to 128 bits, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers
 to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions via unspecified vectors, aka a
 "bits/bytes confusion bug."
