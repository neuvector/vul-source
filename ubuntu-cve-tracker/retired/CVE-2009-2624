Description:
 The huft_build function in inflate.c in gzip before 1.3.13 creates a hufts
 (aka huffman) table that is too small, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash or infinite loop) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted archive.  NOTE: this issue is caused
 by a CVE-2006-4334 regression.
