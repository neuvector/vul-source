Description:
 In Python before 3.10.3 on Windows, local users can gain privileges because
 the search path is inadequately secured. The installer may allow a local
 attacker to add user-writable directories to the system search path. To
 exploit, an administrator must have installed Python for all users and
 enabled PATH entries. A non-administrative user can trigger a repair that
 incorrectly adds user-writable paths into PATH, enabling search-path
 hijacking of other users and system services. This affects Python (CPython)
 through 3.7.12, 3.8.x through 3.8.12, 3.9.x through 3.9.10, and 3.10.x
 through 3.10.2.
