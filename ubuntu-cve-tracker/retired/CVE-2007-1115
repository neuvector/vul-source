Description:
 The child frames in Opera 9 before 9.20 inherit the default charset from
 the parent window when a charset is not specified in an HTTP Content-Type
 header or META tag, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
 scripting (XSS) attacks, as demonstrated using the UTF-7 character set.
