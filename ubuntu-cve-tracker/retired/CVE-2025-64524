Description:
 cups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software required to get
 the cups printing service working on operating systems other than macos. In
 versions 2.0.1 and prior, a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the
 rastertopclx filter causes the program to crash with a segmentation fault
 when processing maliciously crafted input data. This issue can be exploited
 to trigger memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code
 execution. This issue has been patched via commit 956283c.
