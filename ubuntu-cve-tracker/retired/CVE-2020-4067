Description:
 In coturn before version 4.5.1.3, there is an issue whereby STUN/TURN
 response buffer is not initialized properly. There is a leak of information
 between different client connections. One client (an attacker) could use
 their connection to intelligently query coturn to get interesting bytes in
 the padding bytes from the connection of another client. This has been
 fixed in 4.5.1.3.
