Description:
 A vulnerability in the OLE2 file parser of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) versions
 0.104.0 through 0.104.2 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
 cause a denial of service condition on an affected device.The vulnerability
 is due to incorrect use of the realloc function that may result in a
 double-free. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a
 crafted OLE2 file to be scanned by ClamAV on the affected device. An
 exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to
 crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
