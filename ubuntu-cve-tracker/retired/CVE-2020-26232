Description:
 Jupyter Server before version 1.0.6 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A
 maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to
 a different website. All jupyter servers are technically affected, however,
 these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known
 jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may appear safe, but
 ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.
