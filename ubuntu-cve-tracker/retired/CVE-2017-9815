Description:
 In LibTIFF 4.0.7, the TIFFReadDirEntryLong8Array function in
 libtiff/tif_dirread.c mishandles a malloc operation, which allows attackers
 to cause a denial of service (memory leak within the function _TIFFmalloc
 in tif_unix.c) via a crafted file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> If this actually leaks only the 8 bytes shown in the bug then this
  cve should be rejected. I'm marking it 'low' rather than 'negligible'
  just so that we eventually return to the bug and see the results.
 mdeslaur> same commit as CVE-2017-9403
 mdeslaur> this will not be fixed in precise/esm
