Description:
 If a specific sequence of actions is performed when opening a new tab, the
 triggering principal associated with the new tab may have been incorrect.
 The triggering principal is used to calculate many values, including the
 `Referer` and `Sec-*` headers, meaning there is the potential for incorrect
 security checks within the browser in addition to incorrect or misleading
 information sent to remote websites. *This bug only affects Firefox for
 Android. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.* This vulnerability
 affects Firefox < 127.
