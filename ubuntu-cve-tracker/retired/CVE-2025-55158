Description:
 Vim is an open source, command line text editor. In versions from 9.1.1231
 to before 9.1.1406, when processing nested tuples during Vim9 script import
 operations, an error during evaluation can trigger a double-free in Vimâ€™s
 internal typed value (typval_T) management. Specifically, the clear_tv()
 function may attempt to free memory that has already been deallocated, due
 to improper lifetime handling in the handle_import / ex_import code paths.
 The vulnerability can only be triggered if a user explicitly opens and
 executes a specially crafted Vim script. This issue has been patched in
 version 9.1.1406.
