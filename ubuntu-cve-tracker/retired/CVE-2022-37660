Description:
 In hostapd 2.10 and earlier, the PKEX code remains active even after a
 successful PKEX association. An attacker that successfully bootstrapped
 public keys with another entity using PKEX in the past, will be able to
 subvert a future bootstrapping by passively observing public keys, re-using
 the encrypting element Qi and subtracting it from the captured message M (X
 = M - Qi). This will result in the public ephemeral key X; the only element
 required to subvert the PKEX association.
