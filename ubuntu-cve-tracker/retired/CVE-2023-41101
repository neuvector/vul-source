Description:
 An issue was discovered in the captive portal in OpenNDS before version
 10.1.3. get_query in http_microhttpd.c does not validate the length of the
 query string of GET requests. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow
 in versions 9.x and earlier, and to a heap-based buffer overflow in
 versions 10.x and later. Attackers may exploit the issue to crash OpenNDS
 (Denial-of-Service condition) or to inject and execute arbitrary bytecode
 (Remote Code Execution). Affected OpenNDS before version 10.1.3 fixed in
 OpenWrt master and OpenWrt 23.05 on 23. November by updating OpenNDS to
 version 10.2.0.
