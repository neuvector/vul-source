Description:
 sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.3.13 and 5.4.x before 5.4.3, when
 configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), does not properly handle query
 strings that contain a %3D sequence but no = (equals sign) character, which
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line
 options in the query string, related to lack of skipping a certain
 php_getopt for the 'd' case.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1823.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor
 for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query
 strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
 running with the privilege of the web server. Configurations using
 mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable.
Mitigation:
 The php-security.net article has an updated set of mod_rewrite rules that
 can mitigate the vulnerability as well:
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^[^=]*$
   RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} %2d|\- [NC]
   RewriteRule .? - [F,L]
Notes: 
 sbeattie> Please see http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-06-1 for
  more details when using configurations other than as described in
  /usr/share/doc/php5-cgi/README.Debian.gz.
