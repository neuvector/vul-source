Description:
 An authorization flaw was found in Pacemaker before 1.1.16, where it did
 not properly guard its IPC interface. An attacker with an unprivileged
 account on a Pacemaker node could use this flaw to, for example, force the
 Local Resource Manager daemon to execute a script as root and thereby gain
 root access on the machine.
