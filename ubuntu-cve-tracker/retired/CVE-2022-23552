Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Starting with the 8.1 branch and prior to versions 8.5.16, 9.2.10, and
 9.3.4, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin
 GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because SVG files weren't
 properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the
 context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. An
 attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to
 include either an external URL to a SVG-file containing JavaScript, or use
 the `data:` scheme to load an inline SVG-file containing JavaScript. This
 means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with
 Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if
 the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.
 Users may upgrade to version 8.5.16, 9.2.10, or 9.3.4 to receive a fix.
