Description:
 In systemd through 233, certain sizes passed to dns_packet_new in
 systemd-resolved can cause it to allocate a buffer that's too small. A
 malicious DNS server can exploit this via a response with a specially
 crafted TCP payload to trick systemd-resolved into allocating a buffer
 that's too small, and subsequently write arbitrary data beyond the end of
 it.

Notes: 
 chrisccoulson> I believe this was introduced in v223 by
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/a0166609f782da91710dea9183d1bf138538db37
 chrisccoulson> systemd-resolved is not used by default in Xenial. It is
  spawned if a user execs the systemd-resolve utility, but that shouldn't
  impact the system.
