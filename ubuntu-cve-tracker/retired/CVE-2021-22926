Description:
 libcurl-using applications can ask for a specific client certificate to be
 used in a transfer. This is done with the `CURLOPT_SSLCERT` option
 (`--cert` with the command line tool).When libcurl is built to use the
 macOS native TLS library Secure Transport, an application can ask for the
 client certificate by name or with a file name - using the same option. If
 the name exists as a file, it will be used instead of by name.If the
 appliction runs with a current working directory that is writable by other
 users (like `/tmp`), a malicious user can create a file name with the same
 name as the app wants to use by name, and thereby trick the application to
 use the file based cert instead of the one referred to by name making
 libcurl send the wrong client certificate in the TLS connection handshake.
