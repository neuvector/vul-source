Description:
 In Django 2.2 before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2 before 3.2.4,
 URLValidator, validate_ipv4_address, and validate_ipv46_address do not
 prohibit leading zero characters in octal literals. This may allow a bypass
 of access control that is based on IP addresses. (validate_ipv4_address and
 validate_ipv46_address are unaffected with Python 3.9.5+..) .
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> Python earlier than 3.8.0 is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-29921,
