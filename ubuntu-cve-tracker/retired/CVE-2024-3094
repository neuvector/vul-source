Description:
 Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with
 version 5.6.0. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build
 process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing
 in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the
 liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used
 by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the
 data interaction with this library.
