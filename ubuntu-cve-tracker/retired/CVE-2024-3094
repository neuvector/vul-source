Description:
 Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with
 version 5.6.0. 
 Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process
 extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the
 source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma
 code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any
 software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data
 interaction with this library.
