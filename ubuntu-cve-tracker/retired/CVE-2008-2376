Description:
 Integer overflow in the rb_ary_fill function in array.c in Ruby before
 revision 17756 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call to the
 Array#fill method with a start (aka beg) argument greater than
 ARY_MAX_SIZE.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
 other closely related integer overflows.
