Description:
 A problem with the implementation of the new serve-stale feature in BIND
 9.12 can lead to an assertion failure in rbtdb.c, even when
 stale-answer-enable is off. Additionally, problematic interaction between
 the serve-stale feature and NSEC aggressive negative caching can in some
 cases cause undesirable behavior from named, such as a recursion loop or
 excessive logging. Deliberate exploitation of this condition could cause
 operational problems depending on the particular manifestation -- either
 degradation or denial of service. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.
