Description:
 The do_ssl3_write function in s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 1.x through 1.0.1g, when
 SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, does not properly manage a buffer
 pointer during certain recursive calls, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash)
 via vectors that trigger an alert condition.
