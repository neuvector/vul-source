Description:
 curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the NTLM
 authentication code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash
 multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large
 temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then
 subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the
 allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to
 calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds
 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer
 to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the
 use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow. (This bug is almost
 identical to CVE-2017-8816.)
