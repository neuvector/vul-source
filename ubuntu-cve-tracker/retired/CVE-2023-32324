Description:
 OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system. In versions 2.4.2 and
 prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability would allow a remote attacker
 to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. A buffer overflow vulnerability
 in the function `format_log_line` could allow remote attackers to cause a
 DoS on the affected system. Exploitation of the vulnerability can be
 triggered when the configuration file `cupsd.conf` sets the value of
 `loglevel `to `DEBUG`. No known patches or workarounds exist at time of
 publication.
