Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MediaWiki before 1.16.4, when
 Internet Explorer 6 or earlier is used, allows remote attackers to inject
 arbitrary web script or HTML via an uploaded file accessed with a dangerous
 extension such as .html located before a ? (question mark) in a query
 string, in conjunction with a modified URI path that has a %2E sequence in
 place of the . (dot) character.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
 an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1578.
