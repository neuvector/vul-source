Description:
 Squid 2.5, when processing the configuration file, parses empty Access
 Control Lists (ACLs), including proxy_auth ACLs without defined auth
 schemes, in a way that effectively removes arguments, which could allow
 remote attackers to bypass intended ACLs if the administrator ignores the
 parser warnings.
