Description:
 An oracle protection mechanism in the get_client_master_key function in
 s2_srvr.c in the SSLv2 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0
 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a overwrites
 incorrect MASTER-KEY bytes during use of export cipher suites, which makes
 it easier for remote attackers to decrypt TLS ciphertext data by leveraging
 a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, a related issue to CVE-2016-0800.
