Description:
 An internal reference count is held on the buffer pool, incremented every
 time a new buffer is created from the pool. The reference count is
 maintained as an int; on LP64 systems this can cause the reference count to
 overflow if the client creates a large number of wl_shm buffer objects, or
 if it can coerce the server to create a large number of external references
 to the buffer storage. With the reference count overflowing, a
 use-after-free can be constructed on the wl_shm_pool tracking structure,
 where values may be incremented or decremented; it may also be possible to
 construct a limited oracle to leak 4 bytes of server-side memory to the
 attacking client at a time.
