Description:
 Format string vulnerability in Dia 0.94 allows user-assisted attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by
 triggering errors or warnings, as demonstrated via format string specifiers
 in a .bmp filename.  NOTE: the original exploit was demonstrated through a
 command line argument, but there are other mechanisms for input that are
 automatically processed by Dia, such as a crafted .dia file.
