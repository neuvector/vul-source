Description:
 sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, when
 configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), does not properly handle query
 strings that lack an = (equals sign) character, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line options in the
 query string, related to lack of skipping a certain php_getopt for the 'd'
 case.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor
 for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query
 strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
 running with the privilege of the web server. Configurations using
 mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable.
