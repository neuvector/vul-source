Description:
 A flaw was found in samba's DNS server. An authenticated user could use
 this flaw to the RPC server to crash. This RPC server, which also serves
 protocols other than dnsserver, will be restarted after a short delay, but
 it is easy for an authenticated non administrative attacker to crash it
 again as soon as it returns. The Samba DNS server itself will continue to
 operate, but many RPC services will not.
