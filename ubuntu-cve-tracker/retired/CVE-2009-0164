Description:
 The web interface for CUPS before 1.3.10 does not validate the HTTP Host
 header in a client request, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
 conduct DNS rebinding attacks.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 kees> cups/CVE-2009-0164.patch
 jdstrand> patch is large, could break existing configurations if the
  auto-discovery of alternate names does not work (eg, with CNAMES), and
  requires a coordinated attack. The vulnerability appears to be mostly
  information leakage, but might also allow starting and stopping of
  printers. An attacker trying to perform actions via the web interface should
  be challenged by the authentication system. The new ServerAlias directive
  will be a part of 1.3.10.
