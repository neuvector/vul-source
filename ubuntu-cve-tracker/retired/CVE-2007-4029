Description:
 libvorbis 1.1.2, and possibly other versions before 1.2.0, allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) an invalid
 mapping type, which triggers an out-of-bounds read in the vorbis_info_clear
 function in info.c, and (2) invalid blocksize values that trigger a
 segmentation fault in the read function in block.c.
