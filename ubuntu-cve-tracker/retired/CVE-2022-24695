Description:
 Bluetooth Classic in Bluetooth Core Specification through 5.3 does not
 properly conceal device information for Bluetooth transceivers in
 Non-Discoverable mode. By conducting an efficient over-the-air attack, an
 attacker can fully extract the permanent, unique Bluetooth MAC identifier,
 along with device capabilities and identifiers, some of which may contain
 identifying information about the device owner. This additionally allows
 the attacker to establish a connection to the target device.
