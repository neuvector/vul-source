Description:
 A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6.
 Due to incorrect integer-overflow protection, the SSPI and SMB
 authentication helpers are vulnerable to reading unintended memory
 locations. In some configurations, cleartext credentials from these
 locations are sent to a client. This is fixed in 5.7.
