Description:
 systemd 239 through 245 accepts any certificate signed by a trusted
 certificate authority for DNS Over TLS. Server Name Indication (SNI) is not
 sent, and there is no hostname validation with the GnuTLS backend. NOTE:
 This has been disputed by the developer as not a vulnerability since
 hostname validation does not have anything to do with this issue (i.e.
 there is no hostname to be sent)
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> DNS over TLS not enabled by default in Ubuntu.
 mdeslaur> this is only an issue in v243 because strict mode got
 mdeslaur> introduced (DNSOverTLS=yes). Versions earlier than 243 only
 mdeslaur> implemented opportunistic mode which, according to specs,
 mdeslaur> might or not validate the resolver and can also be downgraded.
