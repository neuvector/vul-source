Description:
 The ConvolveHorizontally function in Skia, as used in Mozilla Firefox
 before 31.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.7, and Thunderbird before 24.7,
 does not properly handle the discarding of image data during function
 execution, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
 triggering prolonged image scaling, as demonstrated by scaling of a
 high-quality image.
