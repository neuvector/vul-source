Description:
 The ap_some_auth_required function in server/request.c in the Apache HTTP
 Server 2.4.x before 2.4.14 does not consider that a Require directive may
 be associated with an authorization setting rather than an authentication
 setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging the presence of a
 module that relies on the 2.2 API behavior.
