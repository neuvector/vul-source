Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In Supervisor through 4.0.2, an unauthenticated user can
 read log files or restart a service. Note: The maintainer responded that
 the affected component, inet_http_server, is not enabled by default but if
 the user enables it and does not set a password, Supervisor logs a warning
 message. The maintainer indicated the ability to run an open server will
 not be removed but an additional warning was added to the documentation.
