Description:
 The SSL/TLS server implementation in OpenSSL 0.9.7 before 0.9.7h and 0.9.8
 before 0.9.8a, when using the SSL_OP_MSIE_SSLV2_RSA_PADDING option,
 disables a verification step that is required for preventing protocol
 version rollback attacks, which allows remote attackers to force a client
 and server to use a weaker protocol than needed via a man-in-the-middle
 attack.
