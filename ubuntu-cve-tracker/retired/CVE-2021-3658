Description:
 bluetoothd from bluez incorrectly saves adapters' Discoverable status when
 a device is powered down, and restores it when powered up. If a device is
 powered down while discoverable, it will be discoverable when powered on
 again. This could lead to inadvertent exposure of the bluetooth stack to
 physically nearby attackers.
