Description:
 kbx/keybox-search.c in GnuPG before 1.4.19, 2.0.x before 2.0.27, and 2.1.x
 before 2.1.2 does not properly handle bitwise left-shifts, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid read operation) via
 a crafted keyring file, related to sign extensions and "memcpy with
 overlapping ranges."
