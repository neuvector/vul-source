Description:
 ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
 that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
 service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on an
 affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation
 checking mechanisms in the message parsing function on an affected system.
 An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
 sending a crafted email to the affected device. This action could cause a
 messageAddArgument (in message.c) buffer overflow condition when ClamAV
 scans the malicious email, allowing the attacker to potentially cause a DoS
 condition or execute arbitrary code on an affected device.
