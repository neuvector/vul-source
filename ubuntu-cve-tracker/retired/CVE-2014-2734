Description:
 The openssl extension in Ruby 2.x does not properly maintain the state of
 process memory after a file is reopened, which allows remote attackers to
 spoof signatures within the context of a Ruby script that attempts
 signature verification after performing a certain sequence of filesystem
 operations.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Ruby OpenSSL team
 and third parties, who state that the original demonstration PoC contains
 errors and redundant or unnecessarily-complex code that does not appear to
 be related to a demonstration of the issue. As of 20140502, CVE is not
 aware of any public comment by the original researcher
