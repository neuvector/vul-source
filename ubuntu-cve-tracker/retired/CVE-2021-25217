Description:
 In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other
 branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases in the 4.0.x series or lower and
 releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no
 longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is
 also present in releases from those series, but they have not been
 officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the
 defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the
 component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was
 built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag
 -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not
 successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit
 system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper
 lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected
 system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when
 run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a
 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to
 the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an
 objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally,
 the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease
 database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built
 for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag
 was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the
 offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be
 improperly deleted.
