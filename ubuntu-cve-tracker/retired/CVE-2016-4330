Description:
 In the HDF5 1.8.16 library's failure to check if the number of dimensions
 for an array read from the file is within the bounds of the space allocated
 for it, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to
 arbitrary code execution.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that HDF5 incorrectly handled certain input files. An
 attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.
