Description:
 RabbitMQ is a messaging and streaming broker. Versions prior to 4.0.3 are
 vulnerable to a sophisticated attack that could modify virtual host name on
 disk and then make it unrecoverable (with other on disk file modifications)
 can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the browsers of
 management UI users. When a virtual host on a RabbitMQ node fails to start,
 recent versions
 will display an error message (a notification) in the management UI. The
 error message includes virtual host name, which was not escaped prior to
 open source RabbitMQ 4.0.3 and Tanzu RabbitMQ 4.0.3, 3.13.8. An attack that
 both makes a virtual host fail to start and creates a new virtual host name
 with an XSS code snippet or changes the name of an existing virtual host on
 disk could trigger arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the management UI
 (the user's browser). Open source RabbitMQ `4.0.3` and Tanzu RabbitMQ
 `4.0.3` and `3.13.8` patch the issue.
