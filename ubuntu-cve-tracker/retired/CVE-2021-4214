Description:
 A heap overflow flaw was found in libpngs' pngimage.c program. This flaw
 allows an attacker with local network access to pass a specially crafted
 PNG file to the pngimage utility, causing an application to crash, leading
 to a denial of service.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> The pngimage utility is only used during build to test
 mdeslaur> well-known inputs. It is not shipped in the resulting binary
 mdeslaur> packages, so while the vulnerable code exists in the libpng1.6
 mdeslaur> source package it is not used in an insecure way and is not
 mdeslaur> present on end-user systems. Marking as not-affected.
 mdeslaur> Code is not compiled at all in firefox.
