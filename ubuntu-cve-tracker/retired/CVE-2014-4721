Description:
 The phpinfo implementation in ext/standard/info.c in PHP before 5.4.30 and
 5.5.x before 5.5.14 does not ensure use of the string data type for the
 PHP_AUTH_PW, PHP_AUTH_TYPE, PHP_AUTH_USER, and PHP_SELF variables, which
 might allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information
 from process memory by using the integer data type with crafted values,
 related to a "type confusion" vulnerability, as demonstrated by reading a
 private SSL key in an Apache HTTP Server web-hosting environment with
 mod_ssl and a PHP 5.3.x mod_php.
