Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference was found in the libvirt API responsible
 introduced in upstream version 3.10.0, and fixed in libvirt 6.0.0, for
 fetching a storage pool based on its target path. In more detail, this flaw
 affects storage pools created without a target path such as network-based
 pools like gluster and RBD. Unprivileged users with a read-only connection
 could abuse this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a potential
 denial of service.
