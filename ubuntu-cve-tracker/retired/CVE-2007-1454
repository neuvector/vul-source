Description:
 ext/filter in PHP 5.2.0, when FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING is used with the
 FILTER_FLAG_STRIP_LOW flag, does not properly strip HTML tags, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via HTML
 with a '<' character followed by certain whitespace characters, which
 passes one filter but is collapsed into a valid tag, as demonstrated using
 %0b.
