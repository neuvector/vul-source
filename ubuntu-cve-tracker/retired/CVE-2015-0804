Description:
 The HTMLSourceElement::BindToTree function in Mozilla Firefox before 37.0
 does not properly constrain a data type after omitting namespace validation
 during certain tree-binding operations, which allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a
 crafted HTML document containing a SOURCE element.
