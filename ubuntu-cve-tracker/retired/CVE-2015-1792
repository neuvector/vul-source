Description:
 The do_free_upto function in crypto/cms/cms_smime.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via
 vectors that trigger a NULL value of a BIO data structure, as demonstrated
 by an unrecognized X.660 OID for a hash function.
