Description:
 A heap out-of-bounds memory write exists in FFMPEG since version 5.1. The
 size calculation in `build_open_gop_key_points()` goes through all entries
 in the loop and adds `sc->ctts_data[i].count` to
 `sc->sample_offsets_count`. This can lead to an integer overflow resulting
 in a small allocation with `av_calloc()`. An attacker can cause remote code
 execution via a malicious mp4 file. We recommend upgrading past commit
 c953baa084607dd1d84c3bfcce3cf6a87c3e6e05
