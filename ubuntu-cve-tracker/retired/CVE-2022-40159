 ** DISPUTED ** This record was originally reported by the oss-fuzz project

 be used and failed to contact the JXPath maintainers prior to requesting
 the CVE allocation. The CVE was then allocated by Google in breach of the
 CNA rules. After review by the JXPath maintainers, the original report was
 found to be invalid.
