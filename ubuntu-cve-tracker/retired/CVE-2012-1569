Description:
 The asn1_get_length_der function in decoding.c in GNU Libtasn1 before 2.12,
 as used in GnuTLS before 3.0.16 and other products, does not properly
 handle certain large length values, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (heap memory corruption and application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ASN.1 structure.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per Simon Josefsson (upstream), asn1_get_length_der() does not
  itself have the vulnerability, but that callers wouldn't check its return
  code which could cause a DoS. It was deemed easier for asn1_get_length_der()
  to throw an error rather than changing all callers.
