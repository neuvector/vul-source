Description:
 A request smuggling attack is possible when using MaxBytesHandler. When
 using MaxBytesHandler, the body of an HTTP request is not fully consumed.
 When the server attempts to read HTTP2 frames from the connection, it will
 instead be reading the body of the HTTP request, which could be
 attacker-manipulated to represent arbitrary HTTP2 requests.
