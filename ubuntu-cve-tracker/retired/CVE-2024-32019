Description:
 Netdata is an open source observability tool. In affected versions the
 `ndsudo` tool shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows an
 attacker to run arbitrary programs with root permissions. The `ndsudo` tool
 is packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the SUID bit set. It only
 runs a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths are
 supplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to
 control where `ndsudo` looks for these commands, which may be a path the
 attacker has write access to. This may lead to local privilege escalation.
 This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and 1.45.2-169.
 Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
