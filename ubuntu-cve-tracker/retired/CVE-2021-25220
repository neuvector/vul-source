Description:
 BIND 9.11.0 -> 9.11.36 9.12.0 -> 9.16.26 9.17.0 -> 9.18.0 BIND Supported
 Preview Editions: 9.11.4-S1 -> 9.11.36-S1 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.26-S1 Versions
 of BIND 9 earlier than those shown - back to 9.1.0, including Supported

 records leading to queries being made to the wrong servers, which might
 also result in false information being returned to clients.
