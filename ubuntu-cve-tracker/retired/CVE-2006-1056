Description:
 The Linux kernel before 2.6.16.9 and the FreeBSD kernel, when running on
 AMD64 and other 7th and 8th generation AuthenticAMD processors, only
 save/restore the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an
 exception is pending, which allows one process to determine portions of the
 state of floating point instructions of other processes, which can be
 leveraged to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys. NOTE:
 this is the documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is inconsistent
 with Intel processors in a security-relevant fashion that was not addressed
 by the kernels.
