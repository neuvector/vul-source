Description:
 Mathjax up to v2.7.9 was discovered to contain two Regular expression
 Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities in MathJax.js via the components
 pattern and markdownPattern. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the
 regular expressions are not applied to user input; thus, there is no risk.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Upstream dispute this CVE since these components are internal
  to MathJax.js and cannot be influenced by a user / attacker so there is no
  way to abuse this as a ReDoS
