Description:
 java/org/apache/coyote/http11/filters/ChunkedInputFilter.java in Apache
 Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.42, 7.x before 7.0.55, and 8.x before 8.0.9 does not
 properly handle attempts to continue reading data after an error has
 occurred, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling
 attacks or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by streaming
 data with malformed chunked transfer coding.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled data with malformed
 chunked transfer coding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
 conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks, or cause Tomcat to consume
 resources, resulting in a denial of service.
