Description:
 The Nova scheduler in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom (2012.2) and Essex
 (2012.1), when DifferentHostFilter or SameHostFilter is enabled, allows
 remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (excessive database
 lookup calls and server hang) via a request with many repeated IDs in the
 os:scheduler_hints section.

 Dan Prince from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova scheduler
 nodes. By creating servers with malicious scheduler_hints, an
 authenticated user may generate a huge amount of database calls,
 potentially resulting in a Denial of Service attack against Nova
 scheduler nodes. Only setups exposing the OpenStack API and enabling
 DifferentHostFilter and/or SameHostFilter are affected.
