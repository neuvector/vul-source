Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In ncurses, possibly a 6.x version, there is a NULL pointer
 dereference at the function _nc_name_match that will lead to a denial of
 service attack. NOTE: the original report stated version 6.1, but the issue
 did not reproduce for that version according to the maintainer or a
 reliable third-party.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> for xenial and trusty the issue reproduces for the release version of
 ccdm94> the package with the provided POC file. However, patches applied to fix 
 ccdm94> the CVE group CVE-2017-137xx and the CVE group CVE-2017-1068x have most
 ccdm94> likely fixed the currently considered vulnerability as well, with the

 ccdm94> package that include these patches. This means that within the fixes
 ccdm94> present in the already applied patches was the fix for this CVE as well.
