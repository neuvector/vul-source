Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.6, Thunderbird before 1.5.0.13 and 2.x before
 2.0.0.6, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.4 allow remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary commands via certain vectors associated with launching "a file
 handling program based on the file extension at the end of the URI," a
 variant of CVE-2007-4041. NOTE: the vendor states that "it is still
 possible to launch a filetype handler based on extension rather than the
 registered protocol handler."
