Description:
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug
 in versions 2.6 through 2.7.STABLE9, versions 3.1 through 5.9, and versions
 6.0.1 through 6.5, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack
 against HTTP Request parsing. This problem allows a remote client to
 perform Denial of Service attack by sending a large X-Forwarded-For header
 when the follow_x_forwarded_for feature is configured. This bug is fixed by
 Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the
 stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives.
