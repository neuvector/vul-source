Description:
 Integer overflow in plug-ins/common/psd.c in the Adobe Photoshop PSD plugin
 in GIMP 2.2.13 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted channels header
 value in a PSD image file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2009-3909.
