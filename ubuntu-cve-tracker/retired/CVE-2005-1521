Description:
 Integer overflow in the fetch_io function of the imap4d server in GNU
 Mailutils 0.5 and 0.6, and other versions before 0.6.90, allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via a partial message request with a
 large value in the END parameter, which leads to a heap-based buffer
 overflow.
