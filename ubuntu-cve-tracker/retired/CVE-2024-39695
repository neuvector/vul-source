Description:
 Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
 deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read
 was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.2. The vulnerability is in the parser for
 the ASF video format, which was a new feature in v0.28.0. The out-of-bounds
 read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted
 video file. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.3.
