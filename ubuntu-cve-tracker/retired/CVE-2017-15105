Description:
 A flaw was found in the way unbound before 1.6.8 validated
 wildcard-synthesized NSEC records. An improperly validated wildcard NSEC
 record could be used to prove the non-existence (NXDOMAIN answer) of an
 existing wildcard record, or trick unbound into accepting a NODATA proof.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Ralph Dolmans and Karst Koymans discovered that Unbound did not
 properly handle certain NSEC records. An attacker could use this to
 to prove the non-existence (NXDOMAIN answer) of an existing wildcard
 record, or trick Unbound into accepting a NODATA proof.
