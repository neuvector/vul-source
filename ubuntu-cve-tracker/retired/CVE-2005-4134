Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 1.5, Netscape 8.0.4 and 7.2, and K-Meleon before 0.9.12
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and
 delayed application startup) via a web site with a large title, which is
 recorded in history.dat but not processed efficiently during startup.
 NOTE: despite initial reports, the Mozilla vendor does not believe that
 this issue can be used to trigger a crash or buffer overflow in Firefox.
 Also, it has been independently reported that Netscape 8.1 does not have
 this issue.
