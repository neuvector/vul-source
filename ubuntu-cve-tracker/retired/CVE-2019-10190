Description:
 A vulnerability was discovered in DNS resolver component of knot resolver
 through version 3.2.0 before 4.1.0 which allows remote attackers to bypass
 DNSSEC validation for non-existence answer. NXDOMAIN answer would get
 passed through to the client even if its DNSSEC validation failed, instead
 of sending a SERVFAIL packet. Caching is not affected by this particular
 bug but see CVE-2019-10191.
