Description:
 Python 2.5.2 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via multiple vectors that cause a negative size value to be
 provided to the PyString_FromStringAndSize function, which allocates less
 memory than expected when assert() is disabled and triggers a buffer
 overflow.
