 ** DISPUTED ** This record was originally reported by the oss-fuzz project
 who failed to consider the security context in which JXPath is intended to
 be used and failed to contact the JXPath maintainers prior to requesting
 the CVE allocation. The CVE was then allocated by Google in breach of the
 CNA rules. After review by the JXPath maintainers, the original report was
 found to be invalid.
