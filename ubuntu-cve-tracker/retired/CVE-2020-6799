Description:
 Command line arguments could have been injected during Firefox invocation
 as a shell handler for certain unsupported file types. This required
 Firefox to be configured as the default handler for a given file type and
 for a file downloaded to be opened in a third party application that
 insufficiently sanitized URL data. In that situation, clicking a link in
 the third party application could have been used to retrieve and execute
 files whose location was supplied through command line arguments. Note:
 This issue only affects Windows operating systems and when Firefox is
 configured as the default handler for non-default filetypes. Other
 operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 73
 and Firefox < ESR68.5.
