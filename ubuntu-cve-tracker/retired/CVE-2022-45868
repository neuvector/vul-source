Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The web-based admin console in H2 Database Engine before
 2.2.220 can be started via the CLI with the argument -webAdminPassword,
 which allows the user to specify the password in cleartext for the web
 admin console. Consequently, a local user (or an attacker that has obtained
 local access through some means) would be able to discover the password by
 listing processes and their arguments. NOTE: the vendor states "This is not
 a vulnerability of H2 Console ... Passwords should never be passed on the
 command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to
 know that." Nonetheless, the issue was fixed in 2.2.220.
Ubuntu-Description:

 rodrigo-zaiden> prior to that are not affected.
