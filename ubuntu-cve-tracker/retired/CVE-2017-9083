Description:
 poppler 0.54.0, as used in Evince and other products, has a NULL pointer
 dereference in the JPXStream::readUByte function in JPXStream.cc. For
 example, the perf_test utility will crash (segmentation fault) when parsing
 an invalid PDF file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> I didn't inspect texlive-bin or luatex closely since I didn't
  spot a patch quickly
 mdeslaur> while Debian uses openjpeg, Ubuntu uses the internal JPX
 mdeslaur> decoder
 mdeslaur> texlive-bin is built with --with-system-poppler and
 mdeslaur> --with-system-xpdf, so embedded code copy isn't used.
