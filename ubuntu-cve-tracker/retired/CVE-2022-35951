Description:
 Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 7.0.0 and
 above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing an
 `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially
 crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap
 overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been
 patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.
