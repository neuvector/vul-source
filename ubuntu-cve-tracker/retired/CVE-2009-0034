Description:
 parse.c in sudo 1.6.9p17 through 1.6.9p19 does not properly interpret a
 system group (aka %group) in the sudoers file during authorization
 decisions for a user who belongs to that group, which allows local users to
 leverage an applicable sudoers file and gain root privileges via a sudo
 command.
