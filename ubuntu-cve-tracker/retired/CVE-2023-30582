Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js version 20, affecting users
 of the experimental permission model when the --allow-fs-read flag is used
 with a non-* argument. This flaw arises from an inadequate permission model
 that fails to restrict file watching through the fs.watchFile API. As a
 result, malicious actors can monitor files that they do not have explicit
 read access to.
 
 Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is
 an experimental feature of Node.js.
