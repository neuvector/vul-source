Description:
 In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0 on
 Windows, PHP link() function accepts filenames with embedded \0 byte and
 treats them as terminating at that byte. This could lead to security
 vulnerabilities, e.g. in applications checking paths that the code is
 allowed to access.
