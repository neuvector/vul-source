Description:
 A flaw was found in FRRouting when parsing certain babeld unicast hello
 messages that are intended to be ignored. This issue may allow an attacker
 to send specially crafted hello messages with the unicast flag set, the
 interval field set to 0, or any TLV that contains a sub-TLV with the
 Mandatory flag set to enter an infinite loop and cause a denial of service.
