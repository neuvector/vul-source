Description:
 Sequence of processor instructions leads to unexpected behavior for some
 Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
 escalation of privilege and/or information disclosure and/or denial of
 service via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Benoit Morgan, Paul Grosen, Thais Moreira Hamasaki, Ke Sun, Alyssa Milburn,
 Hisham Shafi, Nir Shlomovich, Tavis Ormandy, Daniel Moghimi, Josh Eads,
 Salman Qazi, Alexandra Sandulescu, Andy Nguyen, Eduardo Vela, Doug Kwan,
 and Kostik Shtoyk discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly
 handle certain sequences of processor instructions. A local attacker could
 possibly use this to cause a core hang (resulting in a denial of service)
 or gain access to sensitive information or possibly escalate their
 privileges.
Notes:
Mitigation:
Bugs:
Priority: high
 Allows privilege escalation from VM to host or unprivileged user to
 privileged user.
