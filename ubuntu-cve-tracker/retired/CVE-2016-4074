Description:
 The jv_dump_term function in jq 1.5 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (stack consumption and application crash) via a crafted
 JSON file. This issue has been fixed in jq 1.6_rc1-r0.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that jq did not perform sufficient bounds checking,
 resulting in unbounded resource consumption. An attacker could use this
 vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
