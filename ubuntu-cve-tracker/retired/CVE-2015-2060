Description:
 cabextract before 1.6 does not properly check for leading slashes when
 extracting files, which allows remote attackers to conduct absolute
 directory traversal attacks via a malformed UTF-8 character that is changed
 to a UTF-8 encoded slash.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that cabextract incorrectly handled certain malformed CAB
 files. A remote attacker could use this issue to write to arbitrary files on
 the host filesystem.
