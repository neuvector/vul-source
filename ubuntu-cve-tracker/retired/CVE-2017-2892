Description:
 An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT
 packet parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted
 MQTT packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory read and write
 potentially resulting in information disclosure, denial of service and
 remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT
 packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.
