Description:
 RSA verification recovery in the EVP_PKEY_verify_recover function in
 OpenSSL 1.x before 1.0.0a, as used by pkeyutl and possibly other
 applications, returns uninitialized memory upon failure, which might allow
 context-dependent attackers to bypass intended key requirements or obtain
 sensitive information via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: some of these details
 are obtained from third party information.
