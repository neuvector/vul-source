 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-2230
Description:
 Multiple format string vulnerabilities in xiTK (xitk/main.c) in xine 0.99.4
 might allow attackers to cause a denial of service via format string
 specifiers in an MP3 filename specified on the command line. NOTE: this is
 a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-1905.  In addition, if the only
 attack vectors involve a user-assisted, local command line argument of a
 non-setuid program, this issue might not be a vulnerability.
