Description:
 JFFS2, as used on One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) build 542 and possibly other
 Linux systems, when POSIX ACL support is enabled, does not properly store
 permissions during (1) inode creation or (2) ACL setting, which might allow
 local users to access restricted files or directories after a remount of a
 filesystem, related to "legacy modes" and an inconsistency between dentry
 permissions and inode permissions.
