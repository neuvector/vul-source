Description:
 Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures
 for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
 reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions
 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula
 injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in
 `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells
 starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\t`. Since then, OWASP added
 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the
 previous prefix char (Tab `\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and
 OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting
 with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP
 recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add
 the prefix to cells starting by `\t`, `\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and
 `@`.
