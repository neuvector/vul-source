Description:
 A parsing vulnerability for the MessageSet type in the ProtocolBuffers
 versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and
 3.21.5 for protobuf-cpp, and versions prior to and including 3.16.1,
 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 4.21.5 for protobuf-python can lead to
 out of memory failures. A specially crafted message with multiple key-value
 per elements creates parsing issues, and can lead to a Denial of Service
 against services receiving unsanitized input. We recommend upgrading to
 versions 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6 for protobuf-cpp and 3.18.3,
 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6 for protobuf-python. Versions for 3.16 and 3.17 are
 no longer updated.
