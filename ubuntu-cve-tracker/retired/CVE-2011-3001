Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 6, Thunderbird before 7.0, and SeaMonkey before
 2.4 do not prevent manual add-on installation in response to the holding of
 the Enter key, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass
 intended access restrictions via a crafted web site that triggers an
 unspecified internal error.
