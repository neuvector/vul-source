Description:
 tables/apr_hash.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library through
 1.4.5 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash
 collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
 denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application
 that maintains a hash table.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> from oss-security: "r1231605 and r1231858 cause massive
 mdeslaur> regressions and test case failures in httpd." (These were
 mdeslaur> subsequently reverted)
 mdeslaur> CVE was asked to be cancelled:
 mdeslaur> http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40apr.apache.org/msg24609.html
 mdeslaur> "After extensive consultation with the security projects of various
 mdeslaur>  APR consumers, it's apparent that there are no actual
 mdeslaur>  vulnerabilities to be exploited here."
 mdeslaur> "These changes do not represent either a security DEFECT nor any
 mdeslaur>  actual security FIX.  The APR Project dis-acknowledges the
 mdeslaur>  assignment of CVE-2012-0840 as erroneous, and invalid."
 mdeslaur> Downgrading priority to "low".
