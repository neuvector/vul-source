Description:
 The web interface (cgi-bin/admin.c) in CUPS before 1.3.8 uses the guest
 username when a user is not logged on to the web server, which makes it
 easier for remote attackers to bypass intended policy and conduct CSRF
 attacks via the (1) add and (2) cancel RSS subscription functions.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Only 1.3.x has rss subscriptions, so dapper is not vulnerable
