Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11,
 and 1.8 before 1.8.19. The django.utils.html.urlize() function was
 extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to catastrophic backtracking
 vulnerabilities in two regular expressions (only one regular expression for
 Django 1.8.x). The urlize() function is used to implement the urlize and
 urlizetrunc template filters, which were thus vulnerable.
