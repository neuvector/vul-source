Description:
 In LibTIFF 4.0.9, there is an uncontrolled resource consumption in the
 TIFFSetDirectory function of tif_dir.c. Remote attackers could leverage
 this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted tif file.
 This occurs because the declared number of directory entries is not
 validated against the actual number of directory entries.
