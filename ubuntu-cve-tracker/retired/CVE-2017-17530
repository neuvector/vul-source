Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** common/help.c in Geomview 1.9.5 does not validate strings
 before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable,
 which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks
 via a crafted URL. NOTE: this is disputed by a third party because no
 untrusted input can be used for the injection.
