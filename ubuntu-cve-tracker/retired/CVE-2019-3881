Description:
 Bundler prior to 2.1.0 uses a predictable path in /tmp/, created with
 insecure permissions as a storage location for gems, if locations under the
 user's home directory are not available. If Bundler is used in a scenario
 where the user does not have a writable home directory, an attacker could
 place malicious code in this directory that would be later loaded and
 executed.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Bundler incorrectly created directories with insecure
 permissions in /tmp. An attacker could write malicious libraries to this
 location for later execution.
