Description:
 curl and libcurl 7.2x before 7.24.0 do not properly consider special
 characters during extraction of a pathname from a URL, which allows remote
 attackers to conduct data-injection attacks via a crafted URL, as
 demonstrated by a CRLF injection attack on the (1) IMAP, (2) POP3, or (3)
 SMTP protocol.
