Description:
 XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request
 data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by
 manipulating the processed input stream with a Java runtime version 14 to
 8. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's
 security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.
 If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security
 Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will
 have to use at least version 1.4.18.
