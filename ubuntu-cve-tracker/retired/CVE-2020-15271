Description:
 In lookatme (python/pypi package) versions prior to 2.3.0, the package
 automatically loaded the built-in "terminal" and "file_loader" extensions.
 Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious
 shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version
 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and
 `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted.
 Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being
 rendered with lookatme.
