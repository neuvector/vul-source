Description:
 The cgi_initialize_string function in cgi-bin/var.c in the web interface in
 CUPS before 1.4.4, as used on Apple Mac OS X 10.5.8, Mac OS X 10.6 before
 10.6.4, and other platforms, does not properly handle parameter values
 containing a % (percent) character without two subsequent hex characters,
 which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information
 from cupsd process memory via a crafted request, as demonstrated by the (1)
 /admin?OP=redirect&URL=% and (2) /admin?URL=/admin/&OP=% URIs.
