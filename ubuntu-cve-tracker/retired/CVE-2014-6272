Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the evbuffer API in Libevent 1.4.x before
 1.4.15, 2.0.x before 2.0.22, and 2.1.x before 2.1.5-beta allow
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 other unspecified impact via "insanely large inputs" to the (1)
 evbuffer_add, (2) evbuffer_expand, or (3) bufferevent_write function, which
 triggers a heap-based buffer overflow or an infinite loop.  NOTE: this
 identifier has been SPLIT per ADT3 due to different affected versions. See
 CVE-2015-6525 for the functions that are only affected in 2.0 and later.
