Description:
 An issue was discovered in BusyBox through 1.30.0. An out of bounds read in
 udhcp components (consumed by the DHCP client, server, and/or relay) might
 allow a remote attacker to leak sensitive information from the stack by
 sending a crafted DHCP message. This is related to assurance of a 4-byte
 length when decoding DHCP_SUBNET. NOTE: this issue exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20679.
