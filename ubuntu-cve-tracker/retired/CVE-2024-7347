Description:
 NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus have a vulnerability in the
 ngx_http_mp4_module, which might allow an attacker to over-read NGINX
 worker memory resulting in its termination, using a specially crafted mp4
 file. The issue only affects NGINX if it is built with the
 ngx_http_mp4_module and the mp4 directive is used in the configuration
 file. Additionally, the attack is possible only if an attacker can trigger
 the processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the
 ngx_http_mp4_module.Â  Note: Software versions which have reached End of
 Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> In Focal and Jammy, the vulnerable module is in the nginx-extras
 mdeslaur> package in universe. Starting with Noble, it appears that it
 mdeslaur> is now included in the main binary in the nginx package.
