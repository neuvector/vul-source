Description:
 Integer overflow in the TIFF image decoding routines in CUPS 1.3.9 and
 earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash)
 and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image, which is not
 properly handled by the (1) _cupsImageReadTIFF function in the imagetops
 filter and (2) imagetoraster filter, leading to a heap-based buffer
 overflow.

 kees> cups/CVE-2009-0163.patch
 jdstrand> without a reproducer, AFAICS cups with libtiff should be vulnerable
  as libtiff doesn't error out on images with a height (ImageLength) larger
  than 0x3fffffff (2^30-1)
