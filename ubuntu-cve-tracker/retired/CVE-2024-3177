Description:
 A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where users may be able to
 launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the
 ServiceAccount admission plugin when using containers, init containers, and
 ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated. The policy ensures
 pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in
 the service accountâ€™s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected
 if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the
 kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation are used together with
 containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom
 field populated.
