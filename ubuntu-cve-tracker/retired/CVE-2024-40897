Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in orcparse.c of ORC
 versions prior to 0.4.39. If a developer is tricked to process a specially
 crafted file with the affected ORC compiler, an arbitrary code may be
 executed on the developer's build environment. This may lead to compromise
 of developer machines or CI build environments.
