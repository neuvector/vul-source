Description:
 Off-by-one error in t1lib 5.1.2 and earlier, as used in Xpdf before
 3.02pl6, teTeX, and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application crash) via a PDF document containing a
 crafted Type 1 font that triggers an invalid memory read, integer overflow,
 and invalid pointer dereference, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2011-0764.
