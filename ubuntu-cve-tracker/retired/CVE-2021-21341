Description:
 XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 XStream before version 1.4.16, there is vulnerability which may allow a
 remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on
 CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of
 service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is
 affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security
 framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you
 rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will
 have to use at least version 1.4.16.
