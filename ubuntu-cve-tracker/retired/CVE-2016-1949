Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 44.0.2 does not properly restrict the interaction
 between Service Workers and plugins, which allows remote attackers to
 bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site that triggers spoofed
 responses to requests that use NPAPI, as demonstrated by a request for a
 crossdomain.xml file.
