Description:
 stunnel before 5.00, when using fork threading, does not properly update
 the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which
 causes subsequent children with the same process ID to use the same entropy
 pool and allows remote attackers to obtain private keys for EC (ECDSA) or
 DSA certificates.
