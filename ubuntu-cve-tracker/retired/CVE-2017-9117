Description:
 In LibTIFF 4.0.6 and possibly other versions, the program processes BMP
 images without verifying that biWidth and biHeight in the
 bitmap-information header match the actual input, as demonstrated by a
 heap-based buffer over-read in bmp2tiff. NOTE: mentioning bmp2tiff does not
 imply that the activation point is in the bmp2tiff.c file (which was
 removed before the 4.0.7 release).
Ubuntu-Description:
