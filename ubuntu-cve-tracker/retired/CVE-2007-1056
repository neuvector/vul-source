Description:
 VMware Workstation 5.5.3 build 34685 does not provide per-user restrictions
 on certain privileged actions, which allows local users to perform
 restricted operations such as changing system time, accessing hardware
 components, and stopping the "VMware tools service" service. NOTE:
 exploitation is simplified via (1) weak file permissions (Users = Read &
 Execute) for %PROGRAMFILES%\VMware; and weak registry key permissions
 (access by Users) for (2) vmmouse, (3) vmscsi, (4) VMTools, (5) vmx_svga,
 and (6) vmxnet in HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\; which allows
 local users to perform various privileged actions outside of the guest OS
 by executing certain files under %PROGRAMFILES%\VMware\VMware Tools, as
 demonstrated by (a) VMControlPanel.cpl and (b) vmwareservice.exe.
