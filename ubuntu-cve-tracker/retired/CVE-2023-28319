Description:
 A use after free vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in the way libcurl
 offers a feature to verify an SSH server's public key using a SHA 256 hash.
 When this check fails, libcurl would free the memory for the fingerprint
 before it returns an error message containing the (now freed) hash. This
 flaw risks inserting sensitive heap-based data into the error message that
 might be shown to users or otherwise get leaked and revealed.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> introduced in 7.81.0 in
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3467e89bb97e6c87c7
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> This only affects curl when built with libssh2. Ubuntu packages
 mdeslaur> contain a delta from debian to build with libssh instead of
 mdeslaur> libssh2, so Ubuntu is not affected by this vulnerability.
