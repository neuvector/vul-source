Description:
 If Firefox is installed to a user-writable directory, the Mozilla
 Maintenance Service would execute updater.exe from the install location
 with system privileges. Although the Mozilla Maintenance Service does
 ensure that updater.exe is signed by Mozilla, the version could have been
 rolled back to a previous version which would have allowed exploitation of
 an older bug and arbitrary code execution with System Privileges. *Note:
 This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems
 are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80, Thunderbird <
 78.2, Thunderbird < 68.12, Firefox ESR < 68.12, and Firefox ESR < 78.2.
