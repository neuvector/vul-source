Description:
 In GLPI before version 9.5.2, the `​pluginimage.send.php​` endpoint allows
 a user to specify an image from a plugin. The parameters can be maliciously
 crafted to instead delete the .htaccess file for the files directory. Any
 user becomes able to read all the files and folders contained in “/files/”.
 Some of the sensitive information that is compromised are the user
 sessions, logs, and more. An attacker would be able to get the
 Administrators session token and use that to authenticate. The issue is
 patched in version 9.5.2.
