Description:
 add_password in pam_radius_auth.c in pam_radius 1.4.0 does not correctly
 check the length of the input password, and is vulnerable to a stack-based
 buffer overflow during memcpy(). An attacker could send a crafted password
 to an application (loading the pam_radius library) and crash it. Arbitrary
 code execution might be possible, depending on the application, C library,
 compiler, and other factors.
