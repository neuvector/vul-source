Description:
 The Python "Flask-Security-Too" package is used for adding security
 features to your Flask application. It is an is a independently maintained
 version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. In
 Flask-Security-Too from version 3.3.0 and before version 3.4.5, the /login
 and /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authentication
 token in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protected
 with a CSRF token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring
 the authentication token. Version 3.4.5 and version 4.0.0 are patched. As a
 workaround, if you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set the
 SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to "0" (seconds) which should make the token
 unusable.
