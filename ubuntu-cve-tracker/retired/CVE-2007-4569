Description:
 backend/session.c in KDM in KDE 3.3.0 through 3.5.7, when autologin is
 configured and "shutdown with password" is enabled, allows remote attackers
 to bypass the password requirement and login to arbitrary accounts via
 unspecified vectors.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that KDM would allow logins without password checks under
 certain circumstances. If autologin was configured, and "shutdown with
 password" enabled, a local user could exploit the problem and gain root
 privileges.
