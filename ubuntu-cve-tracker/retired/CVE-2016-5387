Description:
 The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and
 therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted
 client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow
 remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an
 arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka
 an "httpoxy" issue.  NOTE: the vendor states "This mitigation has been
 assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387"; in other words, this is not a CVE
 ID for a vulnerability.
