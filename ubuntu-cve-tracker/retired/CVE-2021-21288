Description:
 CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible
 way to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave before versions
 1.3.2 and 2.1.1 the download feature has an SSRF vulnerability, allowing
 attacks to provide DNS entries or IP addresses that are intended for
 internal use and gather information about the Intranet infrastructure of
 the platform. This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.
