Description:
 The asn1_d2i_read_bio function in crypto/asn1/a_d2i_fp.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8v, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0i, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1a does not properly
 interpret integer data, which allows remote attackers to conduct buffer
 overflow attacks, and cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact, via crafted DER data, as
 demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an RSA public key.
