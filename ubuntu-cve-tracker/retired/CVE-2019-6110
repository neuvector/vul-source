Description:
 In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output
 from the server, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can
 manipulate the client output, for example to use ANSI control codes to hide
 additional files being transferred.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
 mdeslaur> sftp instead of scp.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Per https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2019-January/037475.html
 mdeslaur> upstream doesn't consider this to be a vulnerability, and as of
 mdeslaur> 2020-07-07, there is no upstream fix. We will not be fixing
 mdeslaur> this issue in Ubuntu stable releases.
