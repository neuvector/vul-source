Description:
 CarrierWave is a solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and other
 Ruby web frameworks. The vulnerability CVE-2023-49090 wasn't fully
 addressed. This vulnerability is caused by the fact that when uploading to
 object storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to set a Content-Type
 value that is interpreted by browsers to be different from what's allowed
 by `content_type_allowlist`, by providing multiple values separated by
 commas. This bypassed value can be used to cause XSS. Upgrade to 3.0.7 or
 2.2.6.
