Description:
 The ScopedClipboardWriter::WritePickledData function in
 ui/base/clipboard/scoped_clipboard_writer.cc in Google Chrome before
 33.0.1750.152 on OS X and Linux and before 33.0.1750.154 on Windows does
 not verify a certain format value, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors
 related to the clipboard.
