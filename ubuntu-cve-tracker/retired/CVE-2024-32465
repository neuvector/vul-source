Description:
 Git is a revision control system. The Git project recommends to avoid
 working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git
 clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to
 make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but
 vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of
 cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has
 been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes
 for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip`
 file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted
 by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the
 context of that repository. The problem has been patched in versions
 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a
 workaround, avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained via
 archives from untrusted sources.
