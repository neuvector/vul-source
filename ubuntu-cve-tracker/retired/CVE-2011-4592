Description:
 The command-line cron implementation in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.6 and 2.1.x
 before 2.1.3 does not properly interact with IP blocking, which might allow
 remote attackers to bypass intended IP address restrictions by leveraging a
 configuration in which IP blocking was disabled to restore cron
 functionality.
