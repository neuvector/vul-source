Description:
 Race condition in the jas_stream_tmpfile function in
 libjasper/base/jas_stream.c in JasPer 1.900.1 allows local users to cause a
 denial of service (program exit) by creating the appropriate tmp.XXXXXXXXXX
 temporary file, which causes Jasper to exit.  NOTE: this was originally
 reported as a symlink issue, but this was incorrect.  NOTE: some vendors
 dispute the severity of this issue, but it satisfies CVE's requirements for
 inclusion.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> opened with O_EXCL
 mdeslaur> ghostscript jasper already uses appropriate temp filename
