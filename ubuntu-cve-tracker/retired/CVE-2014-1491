Description:
 Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.4, as used in Mozilla
 Firefox before 27.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.3, Thunderbird before 24.3,
 SeaMonkey before 2.24, and other products, does not properly restrict
 public values in Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms in ticket
 handling by leveraging use of a certain value.
