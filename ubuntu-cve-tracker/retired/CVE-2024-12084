Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the rsync daemon. This issue
 is due to improper handling of attacker-controlled checksum lengths
 (s2length) in the code. When MAX_DIGEST_LEN exceeds the fixed SUM_LENGTH
 (16 bytes), an attacker can write out of bounds in the sum2 buffer.
