Description:
 When incoming DNS over HTTPS support is enabled using the nghttp2 provider,
 and queries are routed to a tcp-only or DNS over TLS backend, an attacker
 can trigger an assertion failure in DNSdist by sending a request for a zone
 transfer (AXFR or IXFR) over DNS over HTTPS, causing the process to stop
 and thus leading to a Denial of Service. DNS over HTTPS is not enabled by
 default, and backends are using plain DNS (Do53) by default.
