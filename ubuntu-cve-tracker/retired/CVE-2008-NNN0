Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> patch for 03_libpaper_support.dpatch was wrong. have reproducer
 jdstrand> Requires malicious code to call gs_main_init_with_args() multiple
   times. The gs binary itself does not do this, so it is safe.
 jdstrand> checked rdepends on libgs8, libgs-esp (for multiple calls to 
   gsapi_init_with_args, which calls gs_main_init_with_args())-- only okular
   from kde4graphics calls it, and does so once per instance
 jdstrand> marking as negligible because if the user has the ability to compile
   and run malicious code, there are far worse things that could be done
 jdstrand> dapper doesn't ship libgs-esp
 jdstrand> gs-gpl doesn't ship library packages
 jdstrand> gs-afpl doesn't ship library packages
