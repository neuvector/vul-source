Description:
 containerd is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd versions
 prior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a specially-crafted
 container image can result in Unix file permission changes for existing
 files in the hostâ€™s filesystem. Changes to file permissions can deny access
 to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or set extended
 bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not directly allow
 files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating
 process. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a
 workaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted sources. Linux
 security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files
 potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent
 containerd from interacting with specific files.
