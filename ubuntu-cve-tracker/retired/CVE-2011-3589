 The Red Hat mkdumprd script for kexec-tools, as distributed in the
 kexec-tools 1.x before 1.102pre-154 and 2.x before 2.0.0-209 packages in
 Red Hat Enterprise Linux, uses world-readable permissions for vmcore files,
 which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by inspecting the
 file content, as demonstrated by a search for a root SSH key.
