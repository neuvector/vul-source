Description:
 strongSwan versions 5.9.2 through 5.9.5 are affected by authorization
 bypass through improper validation of certificate with host mismatch
 (CWE-297). When certificates are used to authenticate clients in TLS-based
 EAP methods, the IKE or EAP identity supplied by a client is not enforced
 to be contained in the client's certificate. So clients can authenticate
 with any trusted certificate and claim an arbitrary IKE/EAP identity as
 their own. This is problematic if the identity is used to make policy
 decisions. A fix was released in strongSwan version 5.9.6 in August 2022
 (e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136).
