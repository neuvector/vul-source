Description:
 CRLF injection vulnerability in WebKit in Apple Safari before 4.0, iPhone
 OS 1.0 through 2.2.1, and iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1 allows
 remote attackers to inject HTTP headers and bypass the Same Origin Policy
 via a crafted HTML document, related to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
 that depend on communication with arbitrary web sites on the same server
 through use of XMLHttpRequest without a Host header.
