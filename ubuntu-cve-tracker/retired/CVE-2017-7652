Description:
 In Eclipse Mosquitto 1.4.14, if a Mosquitto instance is set running with a
 configuration file, then sending a HUP signal to server triggers the
 configuration to be reloaded from disk. If there are lots of clients
 connected so that there are no more file descriptors/sockets available
 (default limit typically 1024 file descriptors on Linux), then opening the
 configuration file will fail.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Mosquitto incorrectly handled file descriptors.
 An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
