Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 3.2 before 3.2.14 and 4.0 before 4.0.6.
 The Trunc() and Extract() database functions are subject to SQL injection
 if untrusted data is used as a kind/lookup_name value. Applications that
 constrain the lookup name and kind choice to a known safe list are
 unaffected.

Notes:
 alexmurray| original advisory only
  lists 3.2.x and 4.x as affected but looks like 1.11.x as used in bionic
  and 2.2.x as used in focal/impish are also likely vulnerable too
