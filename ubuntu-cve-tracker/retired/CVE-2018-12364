Description:
 NPAPI plugins, such as Adobe Flash, can send non-simple cross-origin
 requests, bypassing CORS by making a same-origin POST that does a 307
 redirect to the target site. This allows for a malicious site to engage in
 cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability affects
 Thunderbird < 60, Thunderbird < 52.9, Firefox ESR < 60.1, Firefox ESR <
 52.9, and Firefox < 61.
