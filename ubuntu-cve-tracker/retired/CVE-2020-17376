Description:
 An issue was discovered in Guest.migrate in virt/libvirt/guest.py in
 OpenStack Nova before 19.3.1, 20.x before 20.3.1, and 21.0.0. By performing
 a soft reboot of an instance that has previously undergone live migration,
 a user may gain access to destination host devices that share the same
 paths as host devices previously referenced by the virtual machine on the
 source host. This can include block devices that map to different Cinder
 volumes at the destination than at the source. Only deployments allowing
 host-based connections (for instance, root and ephemeral devices) are
 affected.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This is only an issue when libvirt is 1.3.4 and later. On
 mdeslaur> Xenial, libvirt is 1.3.1 and is not vulnerable.
 mdeslaur> This is fixed in focal-updates but is not yet in -security
