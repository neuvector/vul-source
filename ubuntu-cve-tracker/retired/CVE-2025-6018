Description:
 A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in
 pam-config within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw
 allows an unprivileged local attacker (for example, a user logged in via
 SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally reserved for a physically
 present, "allow_active" user. The highest risk is that the attacker can
 then perform all allow_active yes Polkit actions, which are typically
 restricted to console users, potentially gaining unauthorized control over
 system configurations, services, or other sensitive operations.
