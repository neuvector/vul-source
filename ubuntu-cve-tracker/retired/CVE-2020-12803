Description:
 ODF documents can contain forms to be filled out by the user. Similar to
 HTML forms, the contained form data can be submitted to a URI, for example,
 to an external web server. To create submittable forms, ODF implements the
 XForms W3C standard, which allows data to be submitted without the need for
 macros or other active scripting Prior to version 6.4.4 LibreOffice allowed
 forms to be submitted to any URI, including file: URIs, enabling form
 submissions to overwrite local files. User-interaction is required to
 submit the form, but to avoid the possibility of malicious documents
 engineered to maximize the possibility of inadvertent user submission this
 feature has now been limited to http[s] URIs, removing the possibility to
 overwrite local files. This issue affects: The Document Foundation
 LibreOffice versions prior to 6.4.4.
