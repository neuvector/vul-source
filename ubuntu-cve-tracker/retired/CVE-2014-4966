Description:
 Ansible before 1.6.7 does not prevent inventory data with "{{" and "lookup"
 substrings, and does not prevent remote data with "{{" substrings, which
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted
 lookup('pipe') calls or (2) crafted Jinja2 data.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Ansible mishandled certain input. A remote attacker
 could use this to execute arbitrary code.
