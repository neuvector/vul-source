Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library and
 the Apache Portable Utility library (aka APR-util) 0.9.x and 1.3.x allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors that trigger crafted calls to
 the (1) allocator_alloc or (2) apr_palloc function in
 memory/unix/apr_pools.c in APR; or crafted calls to the (3) apr_rmm_malloc,
 (4) apr_rmm_calloc, or (5) apr_rmm_realloc function in misc/apr_rmm.c in
 APR-util; leading to buffer overflows. NOTE: some of these details are
 obtained from third party information.
