Description:
 Pydantic is a data validation and settings management using Python type
 hinting. In affected versions passing either `'infinity'`, `'inf'` or
 `float('inf')` (or their negatives) to `datetime` or `date` fields causes
 validation to run forever with 100% CPU usage (on one CPU). Pydantic has
 been patched with fixes available in the following versions: v1.8.2,
 v1.7.4, v1.6.2. All these versions are available on
 pypi(https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/#history), and will be available on
 conda-forge(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydantic) soon. See the
 changelog(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for details. If you
 absolutely can't upgrade, you can work around this risk using a
 validator(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/) to catch
 these values. This is not an ideal solution (in particular you'll need a
 slightly different function for datetimes), instead of a hack like this you
 should upgrade pydantic. If you are not using v1.8.x, v1.7.x or v1.6.x and
 are unable to upgrade to a fixed version of pydantic, please create an
 issue at https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues requesting a
 back-port, and we will endeavour to release a patch for earlier versions of
 pydantic.
