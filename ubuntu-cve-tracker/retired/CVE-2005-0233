Description:
 The International Domain Name (IDN) support in Firefox 1.0, Camino .8.5,
 and Mozilla before 1.7.6 allows remote attackers to spoof domain names
 using punycode encoded domain names that are decoded in URLs and SSL
 certificates in a way that uses homograph characters from other character
 sets, which facilitates phishing attacks.
