Description:
 WebExtensions with the appropriate permissions can attach content scripts
 to Mozilla sites such as accounts.firefox.com and listen to network traffic
 to the site through the "webRequest" API. For example, this allows for the
 interception of username and an encrypted password during login to Firefox
 Accounts. This issue does not expose synchronization traffic directly and
 is limited to the process of user login to the website and the data
 displayed to the user once logged in. This vulnerability affects Firefox <
 60.
