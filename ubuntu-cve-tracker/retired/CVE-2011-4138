Description:
 The verify_exists functionality in the URLField implementation in Django
 before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 originally tests a URL's validity
 through a HEAD request, but then uses a GET request for the new target URL
 in the case of a redirect, which might allow remote attackers to trigger
 arbitrary GET requests with an unintended source IP address via a crafted
 Location header.
