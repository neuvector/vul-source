 https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#JoinPath
Description:
 JoinPath and URL.JoinPath do not remove ../ path elements appended to a
 relative path. For example, JoinPath("https://go.dev", "../go") returns the
 URL "https://go.dev/../go", despite the JoinPath documentation stating that
 ../ path elements are removed from the result.
