Description:
 ajaxterm.js in AjaxTerm 0.10 and earlier generates session IDs with
 predictable random numbers based on certain JavaScript functions, which
 makes it easier for remote attackers to (1) hijack a session or (2) cause a
 denial of service (session ID exhaustion) via a brute-force attack.
