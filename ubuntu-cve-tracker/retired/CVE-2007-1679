Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
 Horde Groupware Webmail 1.0 allow remote authenticated users to inject
 arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors in (1) imp/search.php
 and (2) ingo/rule.php. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor,
 noting that the search.php issue was resolved in CVE-2006-4255, and
 attackers can only use rule.php to inject XSS into their own pages.
