 Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from
 before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory. Administrators
 relying on file access permissions in their manually
 created backups are advised to check them for the directory
 $JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups, and
 delete it if present.
