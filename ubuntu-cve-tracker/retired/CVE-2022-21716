Description:
 Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting
 Python 3.6+. Prior to 22.2.0, Twisted SSH client and server implement is
 able to accept an infinite amount of data for the peer's SSH version
 identifier. This ends up with a buffer using all the available memory. The
 attach is a simple as `nc -rv localhost 22 < /dev/zero`. A patch is
 available in version 22.2.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
