Description:
 XZ Utils provide a general-purpose data-compression library plus
 command-line tools. When built for native Windows (MinGW-w64 or MSVC), the
 command line tools from XZ Utils 5.6.2 and older have a command line
 argument injection vulnerability. If a command line contains Unicode
 characters (for example, filenames) that don't exist in the current legacy
 code page, the characters are converted to similar-looking characters with
 best-fit mapping. Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII characters that
 change the meaning of the command line, which can be exploited with
 malicious filenames to do argument injection or directory traversal
 attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.6.3. Command line tools built for
 Cygwin or MSYS2 are unaffected. liblzma is unaffected.
