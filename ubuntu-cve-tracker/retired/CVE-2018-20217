Description:
 A Reachable Assertion issue was discovered in the KDC in MIT Kerberos 5
 (aka krb5) before 1.17. If an attacker can obtain a krbtgt ticket using an
 older encryption type (single-DES, triple-DES, or RC4), the attacker can
 crash the KDC by making an S4U2Self request.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain S4U2Self
 requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
 service.
