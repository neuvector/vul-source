Description:
 Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x, when running on AMD64 processors, only
 save/restore the FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an
 exception is pending, which allows one domain to determine portions of the
 state of floating point instructions of other domains, which can be
 leveraged to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys, a
 similar vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056.  NOTE: this is the documented
 behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is inconsistent with Intel processors
 in a security-relevant fashion that was not addressed by the kernels.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
