Description:
 Add-on updates failed to verify that the add-on ID inside the signed
 package matched the ID of the add-on being updated. An attacker who could
 perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the user's connection to the update
 server and defeat the certificate pinning protection could provide a
 malicious signed add-on instead of a valid update. This vulnerability
 affects Firefox ESR < 45.5 and Firefox < 50.
