Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** DCTStream::getChars in DCTStream.cc in Poppler 20.12.1 has a
 heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted PDF document. NOTE: later reports
 indicate that this only affects builds from Poppler git clones in late
 December 2020, not the 20.12.1 release. In this situation, it should NOT be
 considered a Poppler vulnerability. However, several third-party Open
 Source projects directly rely on Poppler git clones made at arbitrary
 times, and therefore the CVE remains useful to users of those projects.
