Description:
 LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed
 macros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over,
 document-open etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under the
 share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories of the
 LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2018-16858, to
 avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on
 the file system could be executed. However this new protection could be
 bypassed by a URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions, the parsed url
 describing the script location is correctly encoded before further
 processing. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions
 prior to 6.2.6.
