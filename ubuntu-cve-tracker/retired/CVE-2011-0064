Description:
 The hb_buffer_ensure function in hb-buffer.c in HarfBuzz, as used in Pango
 1.28.3, Firefox, and other products, does not verify that memory
 reallocations succeed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via crafted OpenType font data that triggers use of
 an incorrect index.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> hardy's pango seems to check reallocs correctly in equivalent code
