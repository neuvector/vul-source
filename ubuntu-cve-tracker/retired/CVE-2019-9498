Description:
 The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server, when built against a
 crypto library missing explicit validation on imported elements, do not
 validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. An attacker may
 be able to use invalid scalar/element values to complete authentication,
 gaining session key and network access without needing or learning the
 password. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support
 prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd
 support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including
 version 2.7 are affected.
