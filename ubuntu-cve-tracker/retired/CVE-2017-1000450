 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-1000450
Description:
 In opencv/modules/imgcodecs/src/utils.cpp, functions FillUniColor and
 FillUniGray do not check the input length, which can lead to integer
 overflow. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or
 denial of service. This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenCV incorrectly handled certain image files.
 An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service,
 execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.
