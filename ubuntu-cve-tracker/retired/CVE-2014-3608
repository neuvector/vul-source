Description:
 The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.1.3 allows remote
 authenticated users to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of service
 (resource consumption) by putting the VM into the rescue state, suspending
 it, which puts into an ERROR state, and then deleting the image.  NOTE:
 this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2573.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> requires use with unsupported VMware ESX driver. This is not
  compiled in to libvirt in the Ubuntu archive, which makes this code path
  unavailable in Ubuntu
