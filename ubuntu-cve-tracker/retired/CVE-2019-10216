Description:
 In ghostscript before version 9.50, the .buildfont1 procedure did not
 properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER`
 restrictions. An attacker could abuse this flaw by creating a specially
 crafted PostScript file that could escalate privileges and access files
 outside of restricted areas.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Netanel Fisher discovered that the font handler in Ghostscript did not
 properly restrict privileged calls when '-dSAFER' restrictions were in
 effect. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
 specially crafted file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue
 to access arbitrary files.
