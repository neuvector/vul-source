Description:
 Issue summary: Use of -addreject option with the openssl x509 application
 adds
 a trusted use instead of a rejected use for a certificate.
 
 Impact summary: If a user intends to make a trusted certificate rejected
 for
 a particular use it will be instead marked as trusted for that use.
 
 A copy & paste error during minor refactoring of the code introduced this
 issue in the OpenSSL 3.5 version. If, for example, a trusted CA certificate
 should be trusted only for the purpose of authenticating TLS servers but
 not
 for CMS signature verification and the CMS signature verification is
 intended
 to be marked as rejected with the -addreject option, the resulting CA
 certificate will be trusted for CMS signature verification purpose instead.
 
 Only users which use the trusted certificate format who use the openssl
 x509
 command line application to add rejected uses are affected by this issue.
 The issues affecting only the command line application are considered to
 be Low severity.
 
 The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by
 this
 issue.
 
 OpenSSL 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are also not affected by
 this
 issue.
