Description:
 A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing
 client pipe names connecting to Unix domain sockets within a private
 directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients to
 remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba
 initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming
 client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unix
 directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients
 connecting as root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If
 an attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving to an external
 service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to
 unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events,
 including compromise or service crashes.
