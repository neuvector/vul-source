Description:
 In lighttpd 1.4.46 through 1.4.63, the mod_extforward_Forwarded function of
 the mod_extforward plugin has a stack-based buffer overflow (4 bytes
 representing -1), as demonstrated by remote denial of service (daemon
 crash) in a non-default configuration. The non-default configuration
 requires handling of the Forwarded header in a somewhat unusual manner.
 Also, a 32-bit system is much more likely to be affected than a 64-bit
 system.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> According to upstream the impact is limited to 32-bit lighttpd
 ebarretto> and to specific lighttpd mod_extforward configurations expected
 ebarretto> to be rare.
