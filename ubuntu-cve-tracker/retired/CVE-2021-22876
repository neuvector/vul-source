Description:
 curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an "Exposure of Private
 Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor" by leaking credentials in
 the HTTP Referer: header. libcurl does not strip off user credentials from
 the URL when automatically populating the Referer: HTTP request header
 field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking sensitive data
 to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.
