Description:
 In Sudo through 1.8.29, an attacker with access to a Runas ALL sudoer
 account can impersonate a nonexistent user by invoking sudo with a numeric
 uid that is not associated with any user. NOTE: The software maintainer
 believes that this is not a vulnerability because running a command via
 sudo as a user not present in the local password database is an intentional
 feature. Because this behavior surprised some users, sudo 1.8.30 introduced
 an option to enable/disable this behavior with the default being disabled.
 However, this does not change the fact that sudo was behaving as intended,
 and as documented, in earlier versions
