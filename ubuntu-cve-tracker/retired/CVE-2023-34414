Description:
 The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the
 activation-delay Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs
 from attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a malicious
 page elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately before
 navigating to a site with a certificate error and made the renderer
 extremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap between when
 the error page was loaded and when the display actually refreshed.
 With the right timing the elicited clicks could land in that gap and
 activate the button that overrides the certificate error for that site.
 This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.12, Firefox < 114, and
 Thunderbird < 102.12.
