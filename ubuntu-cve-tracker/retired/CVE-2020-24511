Description:
 Improper isolation of shared resources in some Intel(R) Processors may
 allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure
 via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Joseph Nuzman discovered that some Intel processors may not properly apply
 EIBRS mitigations (originally developed for CVE-2017-5715) and hence may
 allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. A local attacker
 could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.
