Description:
 The Apport hook (DistUpgradeApport.py) in Update Manager, as used by Ubuntu
 12.04 LTS, 11.10, and 11.04, uploads the /var/log/dist-upgrade directory
 when reporting bugs to Launchpad, which allows remote attackers to read
 repository credentials by viewing a public bug report.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0949.
