Description:
 squashfs_opendir in unsquash-1.c in Squashfs-Tools 4.5 stores the filename
 in the directory entry; this is then used by unsquashfs to create the new
 file during the unsquash. The filename is not validated for traversal
 outside of the destination directory, and thus allows writing to locations
 outside of the destination.
