Description:
 Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not
 affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however,
 it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules.
 Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be
 triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and
 header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL)
 files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache
 restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an
 increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend
 servers.
