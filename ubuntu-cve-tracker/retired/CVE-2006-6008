Description:
 ftpd in Linux Netkit (linux-ftpd) 0.17, and possibly other versions, does
 not check the return status of certain seteuid, setgid, and setuid calls,
 which might allow remote authenticated users to gain privileges if these
 calls fail in cases such as PAM failures or resource limits, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2006-5778.
