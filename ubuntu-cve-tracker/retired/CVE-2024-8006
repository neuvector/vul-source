Description:
 Remote packet capture support is disabled by default in libpcap.  When a
 user builds libpcap with remote packet capture support enabled, one of the
 functions that become available is pcap_findalldevs_ex().  One of the
 function arguments can be a filesystem path, which normally means a
 directory with input data files.  When the specified path cannot be used as
 a directory, the function receives NULL from opendir(), but does not check
 the return value and passes the NULL value to readdir(), which causes a
 NULL pointer derefence.
