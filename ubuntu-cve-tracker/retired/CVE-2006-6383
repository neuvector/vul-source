Description:
 PHP 5.2.0 and 4.4 allows local users to bypass safe_mode and open_basedir
 restrictions via a malicious path and a null byte before a ";" in a
 session_save_path argument, followed by an allowed path, which causes a
 parsing inconsistency in which PHP validates the allowed path but sets
 session.save_path to the malicious path.
