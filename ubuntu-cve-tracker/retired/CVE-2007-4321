 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4321
Description:
 fail2ban 0.8 and earlier does not properly parse sshd log files, which
 allows remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file
 and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the sshd
 log file, as demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a client protocol
 version identification containing an IP address string, a different vector
 than CVE-2006-6302.
