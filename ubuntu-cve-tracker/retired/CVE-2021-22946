Description:
 A user can tell curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 to require a successful
 upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd`
 on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or
 `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the
 server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate
 response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations
 **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing
 possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.
