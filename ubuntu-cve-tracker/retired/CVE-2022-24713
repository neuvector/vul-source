Description:
 regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language.
 The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service
 attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted
 regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to
 prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of
 the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations
 designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time
 during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such
 mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by
 sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled,
 untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4
 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5.
 All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade
 immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there
 is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite
 regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of
 this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.
