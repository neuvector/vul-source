Description:
 Xen maintains the _GTF_{read,writ}ing bits as appropriate, to inform the
 guest that a grant is in use. A guest is expected not to modify the grant
 details while it is in use, whereas the guest is free to modify/reuse the
 grant entry when it is not in use. Under some circumstances, Xen will clear
 the status bits too early, incorrectly informing the guest that the grant
 is no longer in use. A guest may prematurely believe that a granted frame
 is safely private again, and reuse it in a way which contains sensitive
 information, while the domain on the far end of the grant is still using
 the grant. Xen 4.9, 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, and 4.5 are affected.
