Description:
 pyjwt is a JSON Web Token implementation in Python. An incorrect string
 comparison is run for `iss` checking, resulting in `"acb"` being accepted
 for `"_abc_"`. This is a bug introduced in version 2.10.0: checking the
 "iss" claim changed from `isinstance(issuer, list)` to `isinstance(issuer,
 Sequence)`. Since str is a Sequnce, but not a list, `in` is also used for
 string comparison. This results in `if "abc" not in "__abcd__":` being
 checked instead of `if "abc" != "__abc__":`. Signature checks are still
 present so real world impact is likely limited to denial of service
 scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 2.10.1. All users are
 advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
