Description:
 webmail.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.0 to 1.4.5 allows remote attackers to
 inject arbitrary web pages into the right frame via a URL in the
 right_frame parameter.  NOTE: this has been called a cross-site scripting
 (XSS) issue, but it is different than what is normally identified as XSS.
