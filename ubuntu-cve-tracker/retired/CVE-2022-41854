Description:
 Those using Snakeyaml to parse untrusted YAML files may be vulnerable to
 Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied
 input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by
 stack overflow. This effect may support a denial of service attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 john-breton> False positive. snakeYAML isn't designed to operate on YAML
 john-breton> data coming from untrusted sources (and won't load the yaml).
 john-breton> No fix exists because there isn't a vulnerability (per
 john-breton> upstream).
