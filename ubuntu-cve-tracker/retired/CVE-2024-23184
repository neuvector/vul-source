Description:
 Having a large number of address headers (From, To, Cc, Bcc, etc.) becomes
 excessively CPU intensive. With 100k header lines CPU usage is already 12
 seconds, and in a production environment we observed 500k header lines
 taking 18 minutes to parse. Since this can be triggered by external actors
 sending emails to a victim, this is a security issue. An external attacker
 can send specially crafted messages that consume target system resources
 and cause outage. One can implement restrictions on address headers on MTA
 component preceding Dovecot. No publicly available exploits are known.
