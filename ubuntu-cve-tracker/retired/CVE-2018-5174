Description:
 In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors
 the "SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI" flag associated with downloaded files and will
 not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be
 allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision,
 and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because
 Windows won't prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets
 this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from
 SmartScreen. Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the
 April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other
 operating systems. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8,
 Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.
