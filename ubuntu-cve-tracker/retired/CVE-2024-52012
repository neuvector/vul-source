Description:
 Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Solr.
 
 Solr instances running on Windows are vulnerable to arbitrary filepath
 write-access, due to a lack of input-sanitation in the "configset upload"
 API.  Commonly known as a "zipslip", maliciously constructed ZIP files can
 use relative filepaths to write data to unanticipated parts of the
 filesystem.  
 This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6 through 9.7.0.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.8.0, which fixes the issue. 
 Users unable to upgrade may also safely prevent the issue by using Solr's
 "Rule-Based Authentication Plugin" to restrict access to the configset
 upload API, so that it can only be accessed by a trusted set of
 administrators/users.
