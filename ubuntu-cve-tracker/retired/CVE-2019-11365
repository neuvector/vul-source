Description:
 An issue was discovered in atftpd in atftp 0.7.1. A remote attacker may
 send a crafted packet triggering a stack-based buffer overflow due to an
 insecurely implemented strncpy call. The vulnerability is triggered by
 sending an error packet of 3 bytes or fewer. There are multiple instances
 of this vulnerable strncpy pattern within the code base, specifically
 within tftpd_file.c, tftp_file.c, tftpd_mtftp.c, and tftp_mtftp.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that atftp's FTP server did not properly handler certain
 input. An attacker could use this to to cause a denial of service (crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code.
