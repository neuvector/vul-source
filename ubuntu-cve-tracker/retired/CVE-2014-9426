Description:
 The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in the Fileinfo
 component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempts to perform a free operation on a
 stack-based character array, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption or application crash) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this is disputed by
 the vendor because the standard erealloc behavior makes the free operation
 unreachable
