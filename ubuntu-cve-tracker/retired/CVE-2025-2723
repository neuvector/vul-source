Description:
 Rejected reason: ** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs:
 none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further
 investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: The code
 maintainer explains that "[the] call is invalid [as] the buffer pointed to
 by "data" must have "len" valid bytes." The documentation was fixed to make
 that clear.
