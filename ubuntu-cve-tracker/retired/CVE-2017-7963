Description:
 The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) interfaces for PHP
 through 7.1.4 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption and application crash) via operations on long strings. NOTE:
 the vendor disputes this, stating "There is no security issue here, because
 GMP safely aborts in case of an OOM condition. The only attack vector here
 is denial of service. However, if you allow attacker-controlled, unbounded
 allocations you have a DoS vector regardless of GMP's OOM behavior.
