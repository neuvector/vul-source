Description:
 SVG's <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element could have been used to load
 unexpected content that could have executed script in certain
 circumstances. While the specification seems to allow this, other browsers
 do not, and web developers relied on this property for script security so
 gecko's implementation was aligned with theirs. This vulnerability affects
 Firefox < 99.
