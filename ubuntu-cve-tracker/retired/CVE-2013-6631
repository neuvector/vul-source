Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the Channel::SendRTCPPacket function in
 voice_engine/channel.cc in libjingle in WebRTC, as used in Google Chrome
 before 31.0.1650.48 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via vectors that trigger the absence of certain statistics
 initialization, leading to the skipping of a required
 DeRegisterExternalTransport call.
