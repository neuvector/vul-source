Description:
 cloud-init through 19.4 relies on Mersenne Twister for a random password,
 which makes it easier for attackers to predict passwords, because rand_str
 in cloudinit/util.py calls the random.choice function.

Notes:
 ccdm94> This CVE has been patched in Xenial ESM. The patch, however, has been 
 ccdm94> added only to the updates pocket, and since cloud-init is only used 
 ccdm94> during first boot (pulling from updates), there should not be a need 
 ccdm94> to add this to the security pocket.
