Description:
 In BIND 9.3.0 -> 9.11.35, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.21, and versions 9.9.3-S1 ->
 9.11.35-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.21-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition,
 as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.18 of the BIND 9.17 development
 branch, exploitation of broken authoritative servers using a flaw in
 response processing can cause degradation in BIND resolver performance. The
 way the lame cache is currently designed makes it possible for its internal
 data structures to grow almost infinitely, which may cause significant
 delays in client query processing.
