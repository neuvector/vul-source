Candidate: CVE-2007-5416

Description:
 Drupal 5.2 and earlier does not properly unset variables when the input
 data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an alphanumeric
 parameter's hash value, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 PHP code by invoking the drupal_eval function through a callback parameter
 to the default URI, as demonstrated by the _menu[callbacks][1][callback]
 parameter.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a
 bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be
 in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in
 Drupal.
