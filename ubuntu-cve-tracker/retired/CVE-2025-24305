Description:
 Insufficient control flow management in the Alias Checking Trusted Module
 (ACTM) firmware for some Intel(R) Xeon(R) processors may allow a privileged
 user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Avraham Shalev discovered that some Intel® Xeon® processors did not
 properly provide sufficient control flow management in the Alias
 Checking Trusted Module (ACTM) firmware. A local authenticated user
 could potentially use this issue to escalate their privileges.
