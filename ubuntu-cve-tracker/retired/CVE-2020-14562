Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component:
 ImageIO). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.7 and
 14.0.1. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
 with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE.
 Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
 to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE. Note: This
 vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running
 sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
 and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely
 on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
 deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
 (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.3
 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).
