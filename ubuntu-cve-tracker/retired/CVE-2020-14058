Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.12 and 5.x before 5.0.3. Due to
 use of a potentially dangerous function, Squid and the default certificate
 validation helper are vulnerable to a Denial of Service when opening a TLS
 connection to an attacker-controlled server for HTTPS. This occurs because
 unrecognized error values are mapped to NULL, but later code expects that
 each error value is mapped to a valid error string.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> In Ubuntu, squid is built without openssl support, so this
 mdeslaur> is not an issue.
