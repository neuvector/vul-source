Description:
 TorchServe is a flexible and easy-to-use tool for serving and scaling
 PyTorch models in production. TorchServe 's check on allowed_urls
 configuration can be by-passed if the URL contains characters such as ".."
 but it does not prevent the model from being downloaded into the model
 store. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced without providing a
 URL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed_urls security
 check. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC)
 through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected. This issue in TorchServe
 has been fixed by validating the URL without characters such as ".." before
 downloading see PR #3082. TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to
 address this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this vulnerability.
