Description:
 Swagger UI 4.1.2 and earlier could allow a remote attacker to conduct
 spoofing attacks. By persuading a victim to open a crafted URL, an attacker
 could exploit this vulnerability to display remote OpenAPI definitions.
 Note: This was originally claimed to be resolved in 4.1.3. However, third
 parties have indicated this is not resolved in 4.1.3 and even occurs in
 that version and possibly others.
