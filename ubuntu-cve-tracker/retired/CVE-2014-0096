Description:
 java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/DefaultServlet.java in the default
 servlet in Apache Tomcat before 6.0.40, 7.x before 7.0.53, and 8.x before
 8.0.4 does not properly restrict XSLT stylesheets, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass security-manager restrictions and read arbitrary files
 via a crafted web application that provides an XML external entity
 declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML
 External Entity (XXE) issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly restrict XSLT stylesheets.
 An attacker could use this issue with a crafted web application to bypass
 security-manager restrictions and read arbitrary files.
