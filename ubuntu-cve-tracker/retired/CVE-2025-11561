Description:
 A flaw was found in the integration of Active Directory and the System
 Security Services Daemon (SSSD) on Linux systems. In default
 configurations, the Kerberos local authentication plugin
 (sssd_krb5_localauth_plugin) is enabled, but a fallback to the an2ln plugin
 is possible. This fallback allows an attacker with permission to modify
 certain AD attributes (such as userPrincipalName or samAccountName) to
 impersonate privileged users, potentially resulting in unauthorized access
 or privilege escalation on domain-joined Linux hosts.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> The upstream fix for this issue removes the fallback to an2ln.
 mdeslaur> Changing this behaviour in stable releases may break existing
 mdeslaur> environments.
 mdeslaur> We will not be releasing an update for this issue for Ubuntu
 mdeslaur> stable releases.
Mitigation:
 In environments where fallback to the an2ln plugin is not desirable,
 "disable = an2ln" can be used to disable it in the localauth configuration
 in the plugins section of krb5.conf. See an example in the upstream bug
 report for this issue:
