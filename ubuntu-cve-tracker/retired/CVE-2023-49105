Description:
 An issue was discovered in ownCloud owncloud/core before 10.13.1. An
 attacker can access, modify, or delete any file without authentication if
 the username of a victim is known, and the victim has no signing-key
 configured. This occurs because pre-signed URLs can be accepted even when
 no signing-key is configured for the owner of the files. The earliest
 affected version is 10.6.0.
