Description:
 The ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8zc,
 1.0.0o, and 1.0.1j does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported
 protocols, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an unexpected handshake, as
 demonstrated by an SSLv3 handshake to a no-ssl3 application with certain
 error handling.  NOTE: this issue became relevant after the CVE-2014-3568
 fix.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu packages aren't compiled with no-ssl3, so aren't actually
 mdeslaur> vulnerable to this issue.
