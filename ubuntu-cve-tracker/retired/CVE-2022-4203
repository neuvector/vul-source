Description:
 A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
 specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
 certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have
 signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
 certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
 issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to
 a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the
 disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive
 plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to
 memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a
 TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a
 TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client
 authentication and a malicious client connects.
