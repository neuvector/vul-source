Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in Ghostscript, which
 occurs when it tries to render a large number of bits in memory. When
 allocating a buffer device, it relies on an init_device_procs defined for
 the device that uses it as a prototype that depends upon the number of bits
 per pixel. For bpp > 64, mem_x_device is used and does not have an
 init_device_procs defined. This flaw allows an attacker to parse a large
 number of bits (more than 64 bits per pixel), which triggers a NULL pointer
 dereference flaw, causing an application to crash.
