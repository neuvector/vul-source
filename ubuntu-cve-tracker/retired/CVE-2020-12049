Description:
 An issue was discovered in dbus >= 1.3.0 before 1.12.18. The DBusServer in
 libdbus, as used in dbus-daemon, leaks file descriptors when a message
 exceeds the per-message file descriptor limit. A local attacker with access
 to the D-Bus system bus or another system service's private AF_UNIX socket
 could use this to make the system service reach its file descriptor limit,
 denying service to subsequent D-Bus clients.
