Description:
 The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows
 authentication bypass for SSH logins. The pam_access.so module doesn't
 correctly restrict login if a user tries to connect from an IP address that
 is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a user with denied access to
 a machine can still get access. NOTE: the relevance of this issue is
 largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory; it does not
 affect Linux-PAM upstream.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> it was stated that upstream is not affected, so, Ubuntu
 rodrigo-zaiden> might not be affected as well, it worth checking
 mdeslaur> This CVE was assigned to a flaw in SUSE-specific code that was
 mdeslaur> part of the upstream PR226, and did not make its way into the
 mdeslaur> the upstream Linux-PAM code. The issue was fixed in PR447, which
 mdeslaur> was included in upstream Linux-PAM 1.5.3.
 mdeslaur> USN-5825-1 and USN-5825-2 added the whole PR447 which fixed a
 mdeslaur> bug, even though the original package didn't contain the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability described in this CVE.
 mdeslaur> Marking lunar, mantic, and noble as not-affected since they do
 mdeslaur> not contain the vulnerable code.
