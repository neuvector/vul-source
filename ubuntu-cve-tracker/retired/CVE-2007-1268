Description:
 Mutt 1.5.13 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when
 invoking GnuPG, which prevents Mutt from visually distinguishing between
 signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple components,
 which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a message without
 detection.
