Description:
 Off-by-one error in the QUtf8Decoder::toUnicode function in Trolltech Qt 3
 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
 a crafted Unicode string that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE:
 Qt 4 has the same error in the QUtf8Codec::convertToUnicode function, but
 it is not exploitable.
