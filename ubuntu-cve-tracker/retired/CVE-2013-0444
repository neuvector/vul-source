Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component
 in Oracle Java SE 7 through Update 11, and OpenJDK 7, allows remote
 attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via
 unknown vectors related to Beans.  NOTE: the previous information is from
 the February 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another
 vendor that this issue is related to "insufficient checks for cached
 results" by the Java Beans MethodFinder, which might allow attackers to
 access methods that should only be accessible to privileged code.
