Description:
 The (1) load_djpeg function in JpegImagePlugin.py, (2) Ghostscript function
 in EpsImagePlugin.py, (3) load function in IptcImagePlugin.py, and (4)
 _copy function in Image.py in Python Image Library (PIL) 1.1.7 and earlier
 and Pillow before 2.3.1 do not properly create temporary files, which allow
 local users to overwrite arbitrary files and obtain sensitive information
 via a symlink attack on the temporary file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> Normally mktemp() mistakes are classed as 'low' because Ubuntu has
  hardlink and symlink protections in the kernel. However, one of the discovered
  flaws is almost certainly also a shell metacharacter injection problem.
