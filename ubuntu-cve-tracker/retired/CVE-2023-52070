Description:
 JFreeChart v1.5.4 was discovered to be vulnerable to ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
 via the 'setSeriesNeedle(int index, int type)' method. NOTE: this is
 disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable
 evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The submission may
 have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust for vulnerability
 identification.
