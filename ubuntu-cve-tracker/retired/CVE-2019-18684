Description:
 Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to root if they have
 write access to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This occurs because
 of a race condition between determining a uid, and the setresuid and openat
 system calls. The attacker can write "ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" to
 /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for a password. NOTE:
 This has been disputed due to the way Linux /proc works. It has been argued
 that writing to /proc/#####/fd/3 would only be viable if you had permission
 to write to /etc/sudoers. Even with write permission to /proc/#####/fd/3,
 it would not help you write to /etc/sudoers
