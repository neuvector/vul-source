Description:
 Python Software Foundation CPython version From 3.2 until 3.6.4 on Windows
 contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in os.symlink() function on
 Windows that can result in Arbitrary code execution, likely escalation of
 privilege. This attack appears to be exploitable via a python script that
 creates a symlink with an attacker controlled name or location. This
 vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 3.7.0 and 3.6.5.
