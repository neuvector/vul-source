Description:
 chmextract.c in the chmextract sample program, as distributed with
 libmspack before 0.8alpha, does not protect against absolute/relative
 pathnames in CHM files, leading to Directory Traversal. NOTE: the vendor
 disputes that this is a libmspack vulnerability, because chmextract.c was
 only intended as a source-code example, not a supported application
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> clamav in xenial+ uses the system libmspack, trusty uses
 mdeslaur> the embedded one.
 mdeslaur> chmextract example isn't shipped in binary packages
