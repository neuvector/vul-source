Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** quartz-jobs 2.3.2 and below was discovered to contain a code
 injection vulnerability in the component
 org.quartz.jobs.ee.jms.SendQueueMessageJob.execute. This vulnerability is
 exploited via passing an unchecked argument. NOTE: this is disputed by
 multiple parties because it is not plausible that untrusted user input
 would reach the code location where injection must occur.
