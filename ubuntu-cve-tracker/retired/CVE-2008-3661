Description:
 Drupal, probably 5.10 and 6.4, does not set the secure flag for the session
 cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http
 requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Drupal doesn't consider this an issue.
 mdeslaur> "It's your responsibility to set session.cookie_secure in the
 mdeslaur> SSL virtual host if you want an SSL-only website."
 mdeslaur> setting to "ignored"
