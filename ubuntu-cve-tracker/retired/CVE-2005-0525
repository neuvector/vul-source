Description:
 The php_next_marker function in image.c for PHP 4.2.2, 4.3.9, 4.3.10 and
 5.0.3, as reachable by the getimagesize PHP function, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a JPEG image
 with an invalid marker value, which causes a negative length value to be
 passed to php_stream_seek.
