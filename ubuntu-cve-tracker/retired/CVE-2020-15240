Description:
 omniauth-auth0 (rubygems) versions >= 2.3.0 and < 2.4.1 improperly validate
 the JWT token signature when using the `jwt_validator.verify` method.
 Improper validation of the JWT token signature can allow an attacker to
 bypass authentication and authorization. You are affected by this
 vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply: 1. You are using
 `omniauth-auth0`. 2. You are using `JWTValidator.verify` method directly OR
 you are not authenticating using the SDKâ€™s default Authorization Code Flow.
 The issue is patched in version 2.4.1.
