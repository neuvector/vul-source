Description:
 A vulnerability in the filesystem image parser for Hierarchical File System
 Plus (HFS+) of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
 cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This
 vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for completion when a file is
 decompressed, which may result in a loop condition that could cause the
 affected software to stop responding. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ filesystem image to be scanned
 by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
 attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to stop responding, resulting
 in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available system
 resources. For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog .
