Description:
 If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a
 <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the
 <code>http-equiv="refresh"</code> attribute, and the content attribute
 specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL,
 regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination
 with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was
 possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context
 of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform
 actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the
 contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original
 message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of
 encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted
 to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to
 a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in
 the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default
 Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This
 vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.
