Description:
 The (1) NSID_SHUFFLE_ONLY and (2) NSID_USE_POOL PRNG algorithms in ISC BIND
 8 before 8.4.7-P1 generate predictable DNS query identifiers when sending
 outgoing queries such as NOTIFY messages when answering questions as a
 resolver, which allows remote attackers to poison DNS caches via unknown
 vectors.  NOTE: this issue is different from CVE-2007-2926.
