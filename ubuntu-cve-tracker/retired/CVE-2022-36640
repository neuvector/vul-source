Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** influxData influxDB before v1.8.10 contains no
 authentication mechanism or controls, allowing unauthenticated attackers to
 execute arbitrary commands. NOTE: the CVE ID assignment is disputed because
 the vendor's documentation states "If InfluxDB is being deployed on a
 publicly accessible endpoint, we strongly recommend authentication be
 enabled. Otherwise the data will be publicly available to any
 unauthenticated user. The default settings do NOT enable authentication and
 authorization."
