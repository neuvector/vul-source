Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
 Prior to version 1.2.27, a SQL injection vulnerability in
 `automation_get_new_graphs_sql` function of `api_automation.php` allows
 authenticated users to exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities to
 perform privilege escalation and remote code execution. In
 `api_automation.php` line 856, the `get_request_var('filter')` is being
 concatenated into the SQL statement without any sanitization. In
 `api_automation.php` line 717, The filter of `'filter'` is
 `FILTER_DEFAULT`, which means there is no filter for it. Version 1.2.27
 contains a patch for the issue.
