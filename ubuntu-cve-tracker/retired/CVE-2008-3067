 sudo in SUSE openSUSE 10.3 does not clear the stdin buffer when password
 entry times out, which might allow local users to obtain a password by
 reading stdin from the parent process after a sudo child process exits.

Notes:
 kees> could not reproduce on Dapper or Gutsy, which predated the patch.
 kees> I think this is a stand-alone vs PAM issue, and Debian/Ubuntu uses PAM.
