Description:
 Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability exists in numpy.sort in NumPy &lt
 and 1.19 in the PyArray_DescrNew function due to missing return-value
 validation, which allows attackers to conduct DoS attacks by repetitively
 creating sort arrays. NOTE: While correct that validation is missing, an
 error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can
 exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be
 practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory
 exhaustion to occur at exactly this place
