Description:
 actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails before
 3.0.13, 3.1.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly
 consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record
 component and the Rack interface, which allows remote attackers to bypass
 intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks via a crafted
 request, as demonstrated by certain "[nil]" values, a related issue to
 CVE-2012-2694.

 There is a vulnerability when Active Record is used in conjunction with
 parameter parsing from Rack via Action Pack.
