Description:
 cURL and libcurl 7.1 before 7.36.0, when using the OpenSSL, axtls, qsossl
 or gskit libraries for TLS, recognize a wildcard IP address in the
 subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted
 certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
