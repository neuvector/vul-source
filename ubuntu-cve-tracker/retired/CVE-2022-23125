Description:
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
 affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to
 exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
 copyapplfile function. When parsing the len element, the process does not
 properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a
 fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
 vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-15869.
