References:
 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5333
Description:
 Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 through 6.0.14, 5.5.0 through 5.5.25, and 4.1.0 through
 4.1.36 does not properly handle (1) double quote (") characters or (2) %5C
 (encoded backslash) sequences in a cookie value, which might cause
 sensitive information such as session IDs to be leaked to remote attackers
 and enable session hijacking attacks.  NOTE: this issue exists because of
 an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-3385.
