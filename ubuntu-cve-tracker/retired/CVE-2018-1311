Description:
 The Apache Xerces-C 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 XML parser contains a use-after-free
 error triggered during the scanning of external DTDs. This flaw has not
 been addressed in the maintained version of the library and has no current
 mitigation other than to disable DTD processing. This can be accomplished
 via the DOM using a standard parser feature, or via SAX using the
 XERCES_DISABLE_DTD environment variable.
