Description:
 Xfce4-session 4.5.91 in Xfce does not lock the screen when the suspend or
 hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for physically
 proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume action, a
 related issue to CVE-2010-2532.  NOTE: there is no general agreement that
 this is a vulnerability, because separate control over locking can be an
 equally secure, or more secure, behavior in some threat environments
