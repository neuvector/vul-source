Description:
 When sending data to an MQTT server, libcurl <= 7.73.0 and 7.78.0 could in
 some circumstances erroneously keep a pointer to an already freed memory
 area and both use that again in a subsequent call to send data and also
 free it *again*.

Notes: 
 alexmurray| MQTT sending support is only present in curl >= 7.70 - see
