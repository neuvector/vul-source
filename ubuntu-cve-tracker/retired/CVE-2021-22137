Description:
 In Elasticsearch versions before 7.11.2 and 6.8.15 a document disclosure
 flaw was found when Document or Field Level Security is used. Search
 queries do not properly preserve security permissions when executing
 certain cross-cluster search queries. This could result in the search
 disclosing the existence of documents the attacker should not be able to
 view. This could result in an attacker gaining additional insight into
 potentially sensitive indices.
