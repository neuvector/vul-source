Description:
 The mod_auth_shadow module 1.0 through 1.5 and 2.0 for Apache with
 AuthShadow enabled uses shadow authentication for all locations that use
 the require group directive, even when other authentication mechanisms are
 specified, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass security
 restrictions.
