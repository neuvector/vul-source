Description:
 The X509_verify_cert function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1n,
 1.0.1o, 1.0.2b, and 1.0.2c does not properly process X.509 Basic
 Constraints cA values during identification of alternative certificate
 chains, which allows remote attackers to spoof a Certification Authority
 role and trigger unintended certificate verifications via a valid leaf
 certificate.
