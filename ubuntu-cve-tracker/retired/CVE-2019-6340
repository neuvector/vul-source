Description:
 Some field types do not properly sanitize data from non-form sources in
 Drupal 8.5.x before 8.5.11 and Drupal 8.6.x before 8.6.10. This can lead to
 arbitrary PHP code execution in some cases. A site is only affected by this
 if one of the following conditions is met: The site has the Drupal 8 core
 RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled and allows PATCH or POST
 requests, or the site has another web services module enabled, like
 JSON:API in Drupal 8, or Services or RESTful Web Services in Drupal 7.
 (Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself does not require an update at
 this time, but you should apply other contributed updates associated with
 this advisory if Services is in use.)
