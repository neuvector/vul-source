Description:
 The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can
 be hyperlinked. Both will display "chrome:" links as active, clickable
 hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link
 to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will
 display "javascript:" links, which users could be tricked into clicking by
 malicious sites. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
