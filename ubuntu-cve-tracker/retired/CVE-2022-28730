Description:
 A carefully crafted request on AJAXPreview.jsp could trigger an XSS
 vulnerability on Apache JSPWiki, which could allow the attacker to execute
 javascript in the victim's browser and get some sensitive information about
 the victim. This vulnerability leverages CVE-2021-40369, where the Denounce
 plugin dangerously renders user-supplied URLs. Upon re-testing
 CVE-2021-40369, it appears that the patch was incomplete as it was still
 possible to insert malicious input via the Denounce plugin. Apache JSPWiki
 users should upgrade to 2.11.3 or later.
