Description:
 screenresolution-mechanism in screen-resolution-extra 0.17.2 does not
 properly use the PolicyKit D-Bus API, which allows local users to bypass
 intended access restrictions by leveraging a race condition via a setuid or
 pkexec process that is mishandled in a PolicyKitService._check_permission
 call.
