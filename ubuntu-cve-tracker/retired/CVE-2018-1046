Description:
 pdns before version 4.1.2 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in dnsreplay.
 In the dnsreplay tool provided with PowerDNS Authoritative, replaying a
 specially crafted PCAP file can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow,
 leading to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution. This buffer
 overflow only occurs when the -ecs-stamp option of dnsreplay is used.
