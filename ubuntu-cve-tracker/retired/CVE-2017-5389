Description:
 WebExtensions could use the "mozAddonManager" API by modifying the CSP
 headers on sites with the appropriate permissions and then using host
 requests to redirect script loads to a malicious site. This allows a
 malicious extension to then install additional extensions without explicit
 user permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 51.
