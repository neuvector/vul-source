Description:
 A vulnerability in the Snort rule evaluation function of Cisco Firepower
 Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
 attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
 device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the DNS reputation
 enforcement rule. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
 crafted UDP packets through an affected device to force a buildup of UDP
 connections. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic
 that is going through the affected device to be dropped, resulting in a DoS
 condition. Note: This vulnerability only affects Cisco FTD devices that are
 running Snort 3.
