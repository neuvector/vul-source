Description:
 VMware Workstation 5.5.3 34685 does not immediately change the availability
 of a shared clipboard when the "Enable copy and paste to and from this
 virtual machine" checkbox is changed, which allows local users to obtain
 sensitive information or conduct certain attacks that are facilitated by
 weaker isolation between the host and guest operating systems.
