Description:
 Sudo 1.6.9 before 1.8.5, when env_reset is disabled, does not properly
 check environment variables for the env_delete restriction, which allows
 local users with sudo permissions to bypass intended command restrictions
 via a crafted environment variable.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Ubuntu uses env_reset by default
 mdeslaur> low priority since this is only vulnerable in a non-default
 mdeslaur> configuration, and not using env_reset is insecure anyway.
