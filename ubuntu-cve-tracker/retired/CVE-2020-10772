Description:
 An incomplete fix for CVE-2020-12662 was shipped for Unbound in Red Hat
 Enterprise Linux 7, as part of erratum RHSA-2020:2414. Vulnerable versions
 of Unbound could still amplify an incoming query into a large number of
 queries directed to a target, even with a lower amplification ratio
 compared to versions of Unbound that shipped before the mentioned erratum.
 This issue is about the incomplete fix for CVE-2020-12662, and it does not
 affect upstream versions of Unbound.
