Description:
 Multiple Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities exists in Sniffit
 prior to 0.3.7 via a crafted configuration file that will bypass
 Non-eXecutable bit NX, stack smashing protector SSP, and address space
 layout randomization ASLR protection mechanisms, which could let a
 malicious user execute arbitrary code.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that SniffIt incorrectly handled certain configuration
 files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary
 code.
Notes:
 sbeattie> sniffit is not setuid, so this issue only affects
   configurations where a user is only permitted to run a subset of
   administrative (e.g. using a sudo configuration that only allows a
   user to run sniffit).
