Description:
 The asm.js implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 36.0.3, Firefox ESR
 31.x before 31.5.2, and SeaMonkey before 2.33.1 does not properly determine
 the cases in which bounds checking may be safely skipped during JIT
 compilation and heap access, which allows remote attackers to read or write
 to unintended memory locations, and consequently execute arbitrary code,
 via crafted JavaScript.
