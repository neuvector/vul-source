Description:
 Multiple format string vulnerabilities in Condor 7.2.0 through 7.6.4, and
 possibly certain 7.7.x versions, as used in Red Hat MRG Grid and possibly
 other products, allow local users to cause a denial of service
 (condor_schedd daemon and failure to launch jobs) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via format string specifiers in (1) the reason for a hold
 for a job that uses an XML user log, (2) the filename of a file to be
 transferred, and possibly other unspecified vectors.
