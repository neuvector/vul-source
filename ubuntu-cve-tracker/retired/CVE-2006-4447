Description:
 X.Org and XFree86, including libX11, xdm, xf86dga, xinit, xload, xtrans,
 and xterm, does not check the return values for setuid and seteuid calls
 when attempting to drop privileges, which might allow local users to gain
 privileges by causing those calls to fail, such as by exceeding a ulimit.
