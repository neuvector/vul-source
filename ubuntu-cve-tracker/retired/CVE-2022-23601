Description:
 Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
 reusable PHP components. The Symfony form component provides a CSRF
 protection mechanism by using a random token injected in the form and using
 the session to store and control the token submitted by the user. When
 using the FrameworkBundle, this protection can be enabled or disabled with
 the configuration. If the configuration is not specified, by default, the
 mechanism is enabled as long as the session is enabled. In a recent change
 in the way the configuration is loaded, the default behavior has been
 dropped and, as a result, the CSRF protection is not enabled in form when
 not explicitly enabled, which makes the application sensible to CSRF
 attacks. This issue has been resolved in the patch versions listed and
 users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
