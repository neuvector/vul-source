Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7 and 5. When receiving a
 request, Squid checks its cache to see if it can serve up a response. It
 does this by making a MD5 hash of the absolute URL of the request. If
 found, it servers the request. The absolute URL can include the decoded
 UserInfo (username and password) for certain protocols. This decoded info
 is prepended to the domain. This allows an attacker to provide a username
 that has special characters to delimit the domain, and treat the rest of
 the URL as a path or query string. An attacker could first make a request
 to their domain using an encoded username, then when a request for the
 target domain comes in that decodes to the exact URL, it will serve the
 attacker's HTML instead of the real HTML. On Squid servers that also act as
 reverse proxies, this allows an attacker to gain access to features that
 only reverse proxies can use, such as ESI.
