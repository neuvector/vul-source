Description:
 The get_option function in dhcpcd 4.0.0 through 6.x before 6.4.3 allows
 remote DHCP servers to cause a denial of service by resetting the
 DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED option in the (1) bootfile or (2) servername section,
 which triggers the option to be processed again.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that dhcpcd incorrectly handled DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED
 option. An attaacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
 service.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Affects dhcpcd 4.0.0 to 6.4.2
