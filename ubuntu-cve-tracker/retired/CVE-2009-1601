Description:
 The Ubuntu clamav-milter.init script in clamav-milter before
 0.95.1+dfsg-1ubuntu1.2 in Ubuntu 9.04 sets the ownership of the current
 working directory to the clamav account, which might allow local users to
 bypass intended access restrictions via read or write operations involving
 this directory.

  the script from)
