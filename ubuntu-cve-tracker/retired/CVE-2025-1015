Description:
 The Thunderbird Address Book URI fields contained unsanitized links. This
 could be used by an attacker to create and export an address book
 containing a malicious payload in a field. For example, in the “Other”
 field of the Instant Messaging section. If another user imported the
 address book, clicking on the link could result in opening a web page
 inside Thunderbird, and that page could execute (unprivileged) JavaScript.
 This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 128.7 and Thunderbird < 135.
