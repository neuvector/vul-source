Description:
 The _gnutls_recv_client_kx_message function in lib/gnutls_kx.c in libgnutls
 in gnutls-serv in GnuTLS before 2.2.4 continues to process Client Hello
 messages within a TLS message after one has already been processed, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and
 crash) via a TLS message containing multiple Client Hello messages, aka
 GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2.
