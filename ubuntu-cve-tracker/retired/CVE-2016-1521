Description:
 The directrun function in directmachine.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2
 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before
 38.6.1, does not validate a certain skip operation, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code, obtain sensitive information, or cause
 a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a
 crafted Graphite smart font.
