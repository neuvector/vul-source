 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4767-1
Description:
 In the trapper functionality of Zabbix Server 2.4.x, specifically crafted
 trapper packets can pass database logic checks, resulting in database
 writes. An attacker can set up a Man-in-the-Middle server to alter trapper
 requests made between an active Zabbix proxy and Server to trigger this
 vulnerability.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Zabbix incorrectly handled certain requests. A remote
 attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.
