Description:
 A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior
 to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is
 reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very
 hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build
 level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.
