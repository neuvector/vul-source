Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in Python 2.4.2 and earlier, running on Linux
 2.6.12.5 under gcc 4.0.3 with libc 2.3.5, allows local users to cause a
 "stack overflow," and possibly gain privileges, by running a script from a
 current working directory that has a long name, related to the realpath
 function.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability. However, the fact that
 it appears in a programming language interpreter could mean that some
 applications are affected, although attack scenarios might be limited
 because the attacker might already need to cross privilege boundaries to
 cause an exploitable program to be placed in a directory with a long name;
 or, depending on the method that Python uses to determine the current
 working directory, setuid applications might be affected.
