Description:
 Buffer overflow in the intT1_EnvGetCompletePath function in
 lib/t1lib/t1env.c in t1lib 5.1.1 allows context-dependent attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a long FileName parameter.  NOTE: this issue was
 originally reported to be in the imagepsloadfont function in php_gd2.dll in
 the gd (PHP_GD2) extension in PHP 5.2.3.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that t1lib does not properly perform bounds checking
 which can result in a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could
 send specially crafted input to applications linked against t1lib which
 could result in a DoS or arbitrary code execution.
Notes:
 jdstrand> while tetex-bin and texlive-bin have embedded t1lib code, it's
   not used
