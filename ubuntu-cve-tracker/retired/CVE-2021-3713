Description:
 An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the UAS (USB Attached SCSI) device
 emulation of QEMU in versions prior to 6.2.0-rc0. The device uses the guest
 supplied stream number unchecked, which can lead to out-of-bounds access to
 the UASDevice->data3 and UASDevice->status3 fields. A malicious guest user
 could use this flaw to crash QEMU or potentially achieve code execution
 with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.
