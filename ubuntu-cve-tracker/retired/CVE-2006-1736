Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 1.x before 1.5 and 1.0.x before 1.0.8, Mozilla Suite before
 1.7.13, and SeaMonkey before 1.0 allows remote attackers to trick users
 into downloading and saving an executable file via an image that is
 overlaid by a transparent image link that points to the executable, which
 causes the executable to be saved when the user clicks the "Save image
 as..." option.  NOTE: this attack is made easier due to a GUI truncation
 issue that prevents the user from seeing the malicious extension when there
 is extra whitespace in the filename.
