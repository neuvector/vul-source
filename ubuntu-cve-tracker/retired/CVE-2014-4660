Description:
 Ansible before 1.5.5 constructs filenames containing user and password
 fields on the basis of deb lines in sources.list, which might allow local
 users to obtain sensitive credential information in opportunistic
 circumstances by leveraging existence of a file that uses the "deb
 http://user:pass@server:port/" format.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Ansible created filenames containing sensitive information.
 An attacker could use this vulnerability to obtain unauthorized access to a 
 private Ubuntu repository.
