Description:

 data could crash when processing a crafted image.

Notes:
 ccdm94> It seems like commit a817832c223 (szukw000:AFL_PATCH_0) was the final
 ccdm94> commit created by a contributor in order to fix this issue. This
 ccdm94> commit contains the changes in commit 7b28bd2b723 (szukw000:863-862)
 ccdm94> which originally attempts to fix this issue. Commit a817832c223
 ccdm94> (pull request 895 for more information) contains the changes in commit
 ccdm94> 7b28bd2b723, which fixes more than just this issue. Commit a817832c223
 ccdm94> was never merged, however, and instead, was broken down into various
 ccdm94> other commits by upstream, and those were merged instead. These commits
 ccdm94> are the following: 178194c0934, 6c4e5bacb9d, 820fcfe8bb1, e03e9474667,
 ccdm94> c5bf5ef4d65 and 16aeb9282f6, which are all referenced in pull request
 ccdm94> 895 (not merged, but the previously mentioned commits reference this
 ccdm94> PR and therefore their links can be accessed through it). Parts of
 ccdm94> commit a817832c223 have also been refactored and added to commit
 ccdm94> 0394f8d0f1c, which was actually merged. This commit might also contain
 ccdm94> changes which contribute to fixing this issue. However, do note that
 ccdm94> this last commit introduced regressions, and further changes had to
 ccdm94> be made in order to fix those. More can be seen in pull request 975.
 ccdm94> The patches that fix this issue are also related to CVE-2016-9580 and
 ccdm94> CVE-2016-9581.
