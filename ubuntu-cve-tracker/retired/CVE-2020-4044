Description:
 The xrdp-sesman service before version 0.9.13.1 can be crashed by
 connecting over port 3350 and supplying a malicious payload. Once the
 xrdp-sesman process is dead, an unprivileged attacker on the server could
 then proceed to start their own imposter sesman service listening on port
 3350. This will allow them to capture any user credentials that are
 submitted to XRDP and approve or reject arbitrary login credentials. For
 xorgxrdp sessions in particular, this allows an unauthorized user to hijack
 an existing session. This is a buffer overflow attack, so there may be a
 risk of arbitrary code execution as well.
