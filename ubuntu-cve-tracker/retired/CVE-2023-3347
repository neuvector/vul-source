Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Samba's SMB2 packet signing mechanism. The
 SMB2 packet signing is not enforced if an admin configured "server signing
 = required" or for SMB2 connections to Domain Controllers where SMB2 packet
 signing is mandatory. This flaw allows an attacker to perform attacks, such
 as a man-in-the-middle attack, by intercepting the network traffic and
 modifying the SMB2 messages between client and server, affecting the
 integrity of the data.
