Description:
 XScreenSaver 4.10, when using a remote directory service for credentials,
 does not properly handle the results from the getpwuid function in
 drivers/lock.c when there is no network connectivity, which causes
 XScreenSaver to crash and unlock the screen and allows local users to
 bypass authentication.
