Description:
 MacOS version of GIMP bundles a Python interpreter that inherits the
 Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) permissions
 granted by the user to the main application bundle. An attacker with local
 user access can
 invoke this interpreter with arbitrary commands or scripts, leveraging the
 application's previously granted TCC permissions to access user's files in
 privacy-protected folders without triggering user prompts. Accessing other
 resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user
 for approval in the name of GIMP, potentially disguising attacker's
 malicious intent.
 
 This issue has been fixed in 3.1.4.2 version of GIMP.
