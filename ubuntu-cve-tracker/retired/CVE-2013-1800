Description:
 The crack gem 0.3.1 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts
 of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
 object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of
 service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for
 (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion, a similar
 vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
