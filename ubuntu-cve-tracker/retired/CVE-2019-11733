Description:
 When a master password is set, it is required to be entered again before
 stored passwords can be accessed in the 'Saved Logins' dialog. It was found
 that locally stored passwords can be copied to the clipboard thorough the
 'copy password' context menu item without re-entering the master password
 if the master password had been previously entered in the same session,
 allowing for potential theft of stored passwords. This vulnerability
 affects Firefox < 68.0.2 and Firefox ESR < 68.0.2.
