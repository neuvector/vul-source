Description:
 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in
 Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from
 9.0.0 before 9.4.1. Solr Streaming Expressions allows users to extract data
 from other Solr Clouds, using a "zkHost" parameter. When original SolrCloud
 is setup to use ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs, they will be sent to
 whatever "zkHost" the user provides. An attacker could setup a server to
 mock ZooKeeper, that accepts ZooKeeper requests with credentials and ACLs
 and extracts the sensitive information, then send a streaming expression
 using the mock server's address in "zkHost". Streaming Expressions are
 exposed via the "/streaming" handler, with "read" permissions. Users are
 recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
 From these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same server
 address (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper credentials
 and ACLs when connecting.
