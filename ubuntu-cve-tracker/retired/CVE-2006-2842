Description:
 PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in functions/plugin.php in
 SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and earlier, if register_globals is enabled and
 magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 PHP code via a URL in the plugins array parameter.  NOTE: this issue has
 been disputed by third parties, who state that Squirrelmail provides
 prominent warnings to the administrator when register_globals is enabled.
 Since the varieties of administrator negligence are uncountable, perhaps
 this type of issue should not be included in CVE.  However, the original
 developer has posted a security advisory, so there might be relevant
 real-world environments under which this vulnerability is applicable
