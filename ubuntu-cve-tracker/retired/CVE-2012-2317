Description:
 The Debian php_crypt_revamped.patch patch for PHP 5.3.x, as used in the
 php5 package before 5.3.3-7+squeeze4 in Debian GNU/Linux squeeze, the php5
 package before 5.3.2-1ubuntu4.17 in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and the php5 package
 before 5.3.5-1ubuntu7.10 in Ubuntu 11.04, does not properly handle an empty
 salt string, which might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication by
 leveraging an application that relies on the PHP crypt function to choose a
 salt for password hashing.
