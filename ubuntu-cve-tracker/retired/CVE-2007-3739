Description:
 mm/mmap.c in the hugetlb kernel, when run on PowerPC systems, does not
 prevent stack expansion from entering into reserved kernel page memory,
 which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via
 unspecified vectors.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that hugetlb kernels on PowerPC systems did not prevent the
 stack from colliding with reserved kernel memory. Local attackers could exploit
 this and crash the system, causing a denial of service.
