Description:
 The glob implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) allows
 remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory
 consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames,
 as demonstrated by glob expressions in STAT commands to an FTP daemon, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
