Description:
 The Command Line Interface (aka Server CLI or administration interface) in
 the master process in the reverse proxy server in Varnish before 2.1.0 does
 not require authentication for commands received through a TCP port, which
 allows remote attackers to (1) execute arbitrary code via a vcl.inline
 directive that provides a VCL configuration file containing inline C code;
 (2) change the ownership of the master process via param.set, stop, and
 start directives; (3) read the initial line of an arbitrary file via a
 vcl.load directive; or (4) conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
 attacks that leverage a victim's location on a trusted network and improper
 input validation of directives.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this report,
 saying that it is "fundamentally misguided and pointless.
