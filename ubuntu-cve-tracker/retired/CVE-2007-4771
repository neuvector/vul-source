Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the doInterval function in regexcmp.cpp in
 libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier
 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a regular
 expression that writes a large amount of data to the backtracking stack. 
 NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
