Description:
 The LocalFrame::isURLAllowed function in core/frame/LocalFrame.cpp in
 Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, does not properly
 check for a page's maximum number of frames, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (invalid count value and use-after-free) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that
 makes many createElement calls for IFRAME elements.
