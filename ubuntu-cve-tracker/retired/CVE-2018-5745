Description:
 "managed-keys" is a feature which allows a BIND resolver to automatically
 maintain the keys used by trust anchors which operators configure for use
 in DNSSEC validation. Due to an error in the managed-keys feature it is
 possible for a BIND server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an
 assertion failure if, during key rollover, a trust anchor's keys are
 replaced with keys which use an unsupported algorithm. Versions affected:
 BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.3-P1, and
 versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.
 Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected.
 Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to
 CVE-2018-5745.
