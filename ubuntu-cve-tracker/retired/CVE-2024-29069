Description:
 In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the
 destination of symbolic links when extracting a snap. The snap format
 is a squashfs file-system image and so can contain symbolic links and
 other file types. Various file entries within the snap squashfs image
 (such as icons and desktop files etc) are directly read by snapd when
 it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a
 malicious snap which contained symbolic links at these paths could then
 cause snapd to write out the contents of the symbolic link destination
 into a world-readable directory. This in-turn could allow an unprivileged
 user to gain access to privileged information.
