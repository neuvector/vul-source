Description:
 The UNIX editor Vim prior to version 9.1.0678 has a use-after-free error in
 argument list handling. When adding a new file to the argument list, this
 triggers `Buf*` autocommands. If in such an autocommand the buffer that was
 just opened is closed (including the window where it is shown), this causes
 the window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argument
 list that we are actually modifying. Once the autocommands are completed,
 the references to the window and argument list are no longer valid and as
 such cause an use-after-free. Impact is low since the user must either
 intentionally add some unusual autocommands that wipe a buffer during
 creation (either manually or by sourcing a malicious plugin), but it will
 crash Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678.
