Description:
 Waitress version 1.4.2 allows a DOS attack When waitress receives a header
 that contains invalid characters. When a header like "Bad-header:
 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\x10" is received, it will cause the regular expression
 engine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to use 100% CPU
 time and blocking any other interactions. This allows an attacker to send a
 single request with an invalid header and take the service offline. This
 issue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the regular expression was
 updated to attempt to match the behaviour required by errata associated
 with RFC7230. The regular expression that is used to validate incoming
 headers has been updated in version 1.4.3, it is recommended that people
 upgrade to the new version of Waitress as soon as possible.
