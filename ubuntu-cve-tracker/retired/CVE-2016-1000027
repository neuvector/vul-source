Description:
 Pivotal Spring Framework through 5.3.16 suffers from a potential remote
 code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted
 data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this
 issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required. NOTE: the
 vendor's position is that untrusted data is not an intended use case. The
 product's behavior will not be changed because some users rely on
 deserialization of trusted data.
