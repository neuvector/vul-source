Description:
 ssh in OpenSSH before 4.7 does not properly handle when an untrusted cookie
 cannot be created and uses a trusted X11 cookie instead, which allows
 attackers to violate intended policy and gain privileges by causing an X
 client to be treated as trusted.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> from secure-testing:
   An exploit needs limited control over the machine running a
   trusted X client, so this is only a slight privilege
   escalation.  The X Security extension is merely an afterthought
   and is unlikely to provide strong security guarantees.
