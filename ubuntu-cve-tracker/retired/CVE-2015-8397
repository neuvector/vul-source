Description:
 The JPEGLSCodec::DecodeExtent function in
 MediaStorageAndFileFormat/gdcmJPEGLSCodec.cxx in Grassroots DICOM (aka
 GDCM) before 2.6.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
 from process memory or cause a denial of service (application crash) via an
 embedded JPEG-LS image with dimensions larger than the selected region in a
 (1) two-dimensional or (2) three-dimensional DICOM image file, which
 triggers an out-of-bounds read.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that GDCM incorrectly handled certain DICOM image files. An
 attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain
 sensitive information from process memory.
