Description:
 Integer overflow in the format string functionality (Perl_sv_vcatpvfn) in
 Perl 5.9.2 and 5.8.6 Perl allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary memory
 and possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers with large
 values, which causes an integer wrap and leads to a buffer overflow, as
 demonstrated using format string vulnerabilities in Perl applications.
