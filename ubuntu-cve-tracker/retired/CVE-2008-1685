Candidate: CVE-2008-1685
References:
 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1685
Description:
 gcc 4.2.0 through 4.3.0 in GNU Compiler Collection, when casts are not
 used, considers the sum of a pointer and an int to be greater than or equal
 to the pointer, which might lead to removal of length testing code that was
 intended as a protection mechanism against integer overflow and buffer
 overflow attacks, and provide no diagnostic message about this removal.
 NOTE: the vendor has determined that this compiler behavior is correct
 according to section 6.5.6 of the C99 standard (aka ISO/IEC 9899:1999)

Notes:
 jdstrand> gcc-4.3 exists in main, so watch for Intrepid and later
