 denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu packages are built with BUILD_MJ2:BOOL=OFF, so the
 mdeslaur> affected code isn't compiled
 ccdm94> according to the comments available in issue 1328 of openjpeg
 ccdm94> (https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues/1328), this issue
 ccdm94> will not be fixed by upstream, as the vulnerable components
 ccdm94> were simply removed from the code in pull request #1350. For
 ccdm94> this reason, xenial and trusty cannot be patched for this issue
 ccdm94> in package openjpeg.
