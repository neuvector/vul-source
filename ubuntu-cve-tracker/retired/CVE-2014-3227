Description:
 dpkg 1.15.9, 1.16.x before 1.16.14, and 1.17.x before 1.17.9 expect the
 patch program to be compliant with a need for the "C-style encoded
 filenames" feature, but is supported in environments with noncompliant
 patch programs, which triggers an interaction error that allows remote
 attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files outside
 of the intended directories via a crafted source package. NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of reliance on unrealistic constraints on the
 behavior of an external program.
