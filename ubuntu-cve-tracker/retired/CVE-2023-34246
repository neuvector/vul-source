Description:
 Doorkeeper is an OAuth 2 provider for Ruby on Rails / Grape. Prior to
 version 5.6.6, Doorkeeper automatically processes authorization requests
 without user consent for public clients that have been previous approved.
 Public clients are inherently vulnerable to impersonation, their identity
 cannot be assured. This issue is fixed in version 5.6.6.
