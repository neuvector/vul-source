Description:
 When a protocol selection parameter option disables all protocols without
 adding any then the default set of protocols would remain in the allowed
 set due to an error in the logic for removing protocols. The below command
 would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext protocol which has been
 explicitly disabled. curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se The flaw is
 only present if the set of selected protocols disables the entire set of
 available protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and
 therefore unlikely to be encountered in real situations. The curl security
 team has thus assessed this to be low severity bug.
