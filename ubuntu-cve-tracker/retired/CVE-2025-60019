Description:
 glib-networking's OpenSSL backend fails to properly check the return value
 of memory allocation routines. An out of memory condition could potentially
 result in writing to an invalid memory location.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> In Ubuntu, glib-networking is built with GnuTLS, and not
 mdeslaur> OpenSSL, so the vulnerable OpenSSL backend is not used.
