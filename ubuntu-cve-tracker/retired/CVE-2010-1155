Description:
 Irssi before 0.8.15, when SSL is used, does not verify that the server
 hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field or a
 Subject Alternative Name field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IRC servers via an arbitrary
 certificate.
