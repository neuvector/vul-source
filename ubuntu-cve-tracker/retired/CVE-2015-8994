Description:
 An issue was discovered in PHP 5.x and 7.x, when the configuration uses
 apache2handler/mod_php or php-fpm with OpCache enabled. With 5.x after
 5.6.28 or 7.x after 7.0.13, the issue is resolved in a non-default
 configuration with the opcache.validate_permission=1 setting. The
 vulnerability details are as follows. In PHP SAPIs where PHP interpreters
 share a common parent process, Zend OpCache creates a shared memory object
 owned by the common parent during initialization. Child PHP processes
 inherit the SHM descriptor, using it to cache and retrieve compiled script
 bytecode ("opcode" in PHP jargon). Cache keys vary depending on
 configuration, but filename is a central key component, and compiled opcode
 can generally be run if a script's filename is known or can be guessed.
 Many common shared-hosting configurations change EUID in child processes to
 enforce privilege separation among hosted users (for example using
 mod_ruid2 for the Apache HTTP Server, or php-fpm user settings). In these
 scenarios, the default Zend OpCache behavior defeats script file
 permissions by sharing a single SHM cache among all child PHP processes.
 PHP scripts often contain sensitive information: Think of CMS
 configurations where reading or running another user's script usually means
 gaining privileges to the CMS database.
