Description:
 The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier remote API at
 /job/(job-name)/api contained information about upstream and downstream
 projects. This included information about tasks that the current user
 otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This
 has been fixed, and the API now only lists upstream and downstream projects
 that the current user has access to.
