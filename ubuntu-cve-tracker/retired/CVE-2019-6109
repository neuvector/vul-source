Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding
 in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker)
 can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by
 using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This
 affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> openssh-ssh1 is only provided for compatibility with old devices
 mdeslaur> that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. We will not be
 mdeslaur> providing any security support for the openssh-ssh1 package as
 mdeslaur> it is insecure and should be used in trusted environments only.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
 mdeslaur> sftp instead of scp.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.
