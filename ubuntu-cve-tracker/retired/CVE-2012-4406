Description:
 OpenStack Object Storage (swift) before 1.7.0 uses the loads function in
 the pickle Python module unsafely when storing and loading metadata in
 memcached, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted pickle object.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes:
 jdstrand> design problem which requires access to the private swift network.
  Memcached portion is fixed upstream but adds a configuration option that
  defaults to using pickle serialization since not all memcached servers
  understand JSON.
 jdstrand> Marking as 'low' since this requires privileged network access
  (per upstream)
