Description:
 A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
 condition on an affected device.
   This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for end-of-string values
 during scanning, which may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker
 could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing
 OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful
 exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to
 terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and
 consuming available system resources.
   For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog .
