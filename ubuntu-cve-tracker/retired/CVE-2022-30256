Description:
 An issue was discovered in MaraDNS Deadwood through 3.5.0021 that allows
 variant V1 of unintended domain name resolution. A revoked domain name can
 still be resolvable for a long time, including expired domains and
 taken-down malicious domains. The effects of an exploit would be widespread
 and highly impactful, because the exploitation conforms to de facto DNS
 specifications and operational practices, and overcomes current mitigation
 patches for "Ghost" domain names.
