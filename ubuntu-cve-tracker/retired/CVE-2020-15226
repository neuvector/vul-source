Description:
 In GLPI before version 9.5.2, there is a SQL Injection in the API's search
 function. Not only is it possible to break the SQL syntax, but it is also
 possible to utilise a UNION SELECT query to reflect sensitive information
 such as the current database version, or database user. The most likely
 scenario for this vulnerability is with someone who has an API account to
 the system. The issue is patched in version 9.5.2. A proof-of-concept with
 technical details is available in the linked advisory.
