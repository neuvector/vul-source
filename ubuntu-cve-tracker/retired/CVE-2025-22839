Description:
 Insufficient granularity of access control in the OOB-MSM for some Intel(R)
 Xeon(R) 6 Scalable processors may allow a privileged user to potentially
 enable escalation of privilege via adjacent access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that some Intel® Xeon® 6 processors did not properly
 provide sufficient granularity of access control in the out of band
 management service module (OOB-MSM). An authenticated user could
 potentially use this issue to escalate their privileges.
