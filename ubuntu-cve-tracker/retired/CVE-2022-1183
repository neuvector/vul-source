Description:
 On vulnerable configurations, the named daemon may, in some circumstances,
 terminate with an assertion failure. Vulnerable configurations are those
 that include a reference to http within the listen-on statements in their
 named.conf. TLS is used by both DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS
 (DoH), but configurations using DoT alone are unaffected. Affects BIND
 9.18.0 -> 9.18.2 and version 9.19.0 of the BIND 9.19 development branch.
