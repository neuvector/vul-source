Description:
 An off-by-one error was discovered in opj_tcd_code_block_enc_allocate_data
 in lib/openjp2/tcd.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0. The vulnerability causes an
 out-of-bounds write, which may lead to remote denial of service (heap-based
 buffer overflow affecting opj_mqc_flush in lib/openjp2/mqc.c and
 opj_t1_encode_cblk in lib/openjp2/t1.c) or possibly remote code execution.
