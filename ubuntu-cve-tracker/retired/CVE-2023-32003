Description:
 `fs.mkdtemp()` and `fs.mkdtempSync()` can be used to bypass the permission
 model check using a path traversal attack. This flaw arises from a missing
 check in the fs.mkdtemp() API and the impact is a malicious actor could
 create an arbitrary directory. This vulnerability affects all users using
 the experimental permission model in Node.js 20. Please note that at the
 time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature
 of Node.js.
