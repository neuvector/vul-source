Description:
 A double free vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 when sharing HSTS data
 between separate "handles". This sharing was introduced without
 considerations for do this sharing across separate threads but there was no
 indication of this fact in the documentation. Due to missing mutexes or
 thread locks, two threads sharing the same HSTS data could end up doing a
 double-free or use-after-free.
