Description:
 The ProcessGpsInfo function of the gpsinfo.c file of jhead 3.00 may allow a
 remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack or unspecified other
 impact via a malicious JPEG file, because of inconsistency between float
 and double in a sprintf format string during TAG_GPS_ALT handling.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that jhead did not properly handle certain crafted input. If
 a user were tricked into opening a malicious JPEG file, a remote attacker could
 cause jhead to crash.
