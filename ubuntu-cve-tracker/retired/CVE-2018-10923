Description:
 It was found that the "mknod" call derived from mknod(2) can create files
 pointing to devices on a glusterfs server node. An authenticated attacker
 could use this to create an arbitrary device and read data from any device
 attached to the glusterfs server node.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled file creation. An
 authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to create arbitrary files
 and obtain sensitive information.
