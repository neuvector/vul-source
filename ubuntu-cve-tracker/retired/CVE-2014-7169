Description:
 GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain
 malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables,
 which allows remote attackers to write to files or possibly have unknown
 other impact via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors
 involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and
 mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified
 DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs
 across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE: this vulnerability
 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.
