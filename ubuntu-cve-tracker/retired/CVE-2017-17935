Description:
 The File_read_line function in epan/wslua/wslua_file.c in Wireshark through
 2.2.11 does not properly strip '\n' characters, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer underflow and application
 crash) via a crafted packet that triggers the attempted processing of an
 empty line.
