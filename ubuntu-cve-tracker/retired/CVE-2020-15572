Description:
 Tor before 0.4.3.6 has an out-of-bounds memory access that allows a remote
 denial-of-service (crash) attack against Tor instances built to use Mozilla
 Network Security Services (NSS), aka TROVE-2020-001.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray| tor in Ubuntu is not compiled with NSS support (instead we use
  OpenSSL) and so the tor package in Ubuntu is not affected by this
  vulnerability.
