Description:
 In Keepalived through 2.2.4, the D-Bus policy does not sufficiently
 restrict the message destination, allowing any user to inspect and
 manipulate any property. This leads to access-control bypass in some
 situations in which an unrelated D-Bus system service has a settable
 (writable) property
