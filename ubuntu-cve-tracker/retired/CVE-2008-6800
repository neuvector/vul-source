Description:
 ** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason:
 this candidate is not a security issue.  It was originally created based on
 one vendor's misinterpretation of an upstream changelog comment that
 referred to a race condition in the winbind daemon (aka winbindd) in Samba
 before 3.0.32.  The upstream vendor states: "The Samba Team sees no way to
 exploit this race condition by a user of the system or an external
 attacker. In order to be able to trigger the race condition a privileged
 user (root) need to intentionally kill a winbind child process and
 carefully time the killing to trigger the race condition. Although, if the
 user is already privileged, it can more easily just kill the parent process
 directly."  CVE concurs with the dispute.  Notes: CVE users should not use
 this identifier.
