Description:
 An issue was discovered in Docker Moby before 17.06.0. The Docker engine
 validated a client TLS certificate using both the configured client CA root
 certificate and all system roots on non-Windows systems. This allowed a
 client with any domain validated certificate signed by a system-trusted
 root CA (as opposed to one signed by the configured CA root certificate) to
 authenticate.
