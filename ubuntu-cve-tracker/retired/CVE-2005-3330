 The _httpsrequest function in Snoopy 1.2, as used in products such as (1)
 MagpieRSS, (2) WordPress, (3) Ampache, and (4) Jinzora, allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in an
 HTTPS URL to an SSL protected web page, which is not properly handled by
 the fetch function.
