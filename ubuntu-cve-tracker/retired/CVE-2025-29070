Description:
 A heap buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified in thesmooth2() in
 cmsgamma.c in lcms2-2.16 which allows a remote attacker to cause a denial
 of service. NOTE: the Supplier disputes this because "this is not
 exploitable as this function is never called on normal color management, is
 there only as a helper for low-level programming and investigation."

Notes:
 mdeslaur> The commit linked below only adds a check to make sure the
 mdeslaur> caller of the function is not attempting to do something
 mdeslaur> invalid. It is not a flaw in lcms2 itself.
 mdeslaur> This CVE is likely to get rejected, marking as not-affected.
