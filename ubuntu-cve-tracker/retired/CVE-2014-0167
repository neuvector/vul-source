Description:
 The Nova EC2 API security group implementation in OpenStack Compute (Nova)
 2013.1 before 2013.2.4 and icehouse before icehouse-rc2 does not enforce
 RBAC policies for (1) add_rules, (2) remove_rules, (3) destroy, and other
 unspecified methods in compute/api.py when using non-default policies,
 which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges via these API
 requests.
