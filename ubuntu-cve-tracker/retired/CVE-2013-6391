Description:
 The ec2tokens API in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) before Havana 2013.2.1
 and Icehouse before icehouse-2 does not return a trust-scoped token when
 one is received, which allows remote trust users to gain privileges by
 generating EC2 credentials from a trust-scoped token and using them in an
 ec2tokens API request.
