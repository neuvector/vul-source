Description:
 A flaw was found in the Cephx authentication protocol in versions before
 15.2.6 and before 14.2.14, where it does not verify Ceph clients correctly
 and is then vulnerable to replay attacks in Nautilus. This flaw allows an
 attacker with access to the Ceph cluster network to authenticate with the
 Ceph service via a packet sniffer and perform actions allowed by the Ceph
 service. This issue is a reintroduction of CVE-2018-1128, affecting the
 msgr2 protocol. The msgr 2 protocol is used for all communication except
 older clients that do not support the msgr2 protocol. The msgr1 protocol is
 not affected. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
 confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.
