Description:
 The readObject method in the DiskFileItem class in Apache Tomcat and JBoss
 Web, as used in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 and Red
 Hat JBoss Portal 6.0.0, allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files
 via a NULL byte in a file name in a serialized instance, a similar issue to
 CVE-2013-2186.  NOTE: this issue is reportedly disputed by the Apache
 Tomcat team, although Red Hat considers it a vulnerability. The dispute
 appears to regard whether it is the responsibility of applications to avoid
 providing untrusted data to be deserialized, or whether this class should
 inherently protect against this issue
