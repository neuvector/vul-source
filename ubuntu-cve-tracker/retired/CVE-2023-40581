Description:
 yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. yt-dlp
 allows the user to provide shell command lines to be executed at various
 stages in its download steps through the `--exec` flag. This flag allows
 output template expansion in its argument, so that metadata values may be
 used in the shell commands. The metadata fields can be combined with the
 `%q` conversion, which is intended to quote/escape these values so they can
 be safely passed to the shell. However, the escaping used for `cmd` (the
 shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows) does not properly escape
 special characters, which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec`
 is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability
 only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present
 regardless of whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`.
 Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this
 vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp
 version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special
 character. `\n` will be replaced by `\r` as no way of escaping it has been
 found. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon as
 possible. Also, always be careful when using --exec, because while this
 specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell
 commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to
 upgrade: 1. Avoid using any output template expansion in --exec other than
 {} (filepath). 2. If expansion in --exec is needed, verify the fields you
 are using do not contain ", | or &. 3. Instead of using --exec, write the
 info json and load the fields from it instead.
