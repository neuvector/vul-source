Description:
 When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read
 callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the
 `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously was
 used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may
 surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the
 wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST`
 request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is
 changed from a PUT to a POST.
