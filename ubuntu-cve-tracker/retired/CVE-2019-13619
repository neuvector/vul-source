Description:
 In Wireshark 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, 2.6.0 to 2.6.9, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.15, the ASN.1
 BER dissector and related dissectors could crash. This was addressed in
 epan/asn1.c by properly restricting buffer increments.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Wireshark improperly handled certain input. A remote or
 local attacker could cause Wireshark to crash by injecting malformed packets
 onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
