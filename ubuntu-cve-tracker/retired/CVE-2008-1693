Description:
 The CairoFont::create function in CairoFontEngine.cc in Poppler, possibly
 before 0.8.0, as used in Xpdf, Evince, ePDFview, KWord, and other
 applications, does not properly handle embedded fonts in PDF files, which
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted font
 object, related to dereferencing a function pointer associated with the
 type of this font object.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes: 
 kees> there are two issues -- the specific vulnerability in embedded fonts
 kees> and the fact that the Object types are unchecked when calling union
 kees> member functions.
 fujitsu> libextractor isn't affected by the main CairoFont vulnerability.
