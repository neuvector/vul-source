Description:
 Buffer underflow in the PHP_FILTER_TRIM_DEFAULT macro in the filtering
 extension (ext/filter) in PHP 5.2.0 allows context-dependent attackers to
 execute arbitrary code by calling filter_var with certain modes such as
 FILTER_VALIDATE_INT, which causes filter to write a null byte in whitespace
 that precedes the buffer.
