Description:
 The multiplayer engine in Wesnoth 1.2.x before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.9
 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long
 message with multibyte characters that can produce an invalid UTF-8 string
 after it is truncated, which triggers an uncaught exception, involving the
 truncate_message function in server/server.cpp.  NOTE: this issue affects
 both clients and servers.
