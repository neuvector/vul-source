Description:
 On Linux, Node.js ignores certain environment variables if those may have
 been set by an unprivileged user while the process is running with elevated
 privileges with the only exception of CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE. Due to a bug in
 the implementation of this exception, Node.js incorrectly applies this
 exception even when certain other capabilities have been set. This allows
 unprivileged users to inject code that inherits the process's elevated
 privileges.
