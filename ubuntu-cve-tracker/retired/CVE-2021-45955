Description:
 Dnsmasq 2.86 has a heap-based buffer overflow in resize_packet (called from
 FuzzResizePacket and fuzz_rfc1035.c) because of the lack of a proper bounds
 check upon pseudo header re-insertion. NOTE: the vendor's position is that
 CVE-2021-45951 through CVE-2021-45957 "do not represent real
 vulnerabilities, to the best of our knowledge." However, a contributor
 states that a security patch (mentioned in 016162.html) is needed
