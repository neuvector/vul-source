Description:
 LedgerSMB is a free web-based double-entry accounting system. When a
 LedgerSMB database administrator has an active session in /setup.pl, an
 attacker can trick the admin into clicking on a link which automatically
 submits a request to setup.pl without the admin's consent.  This request
 can be used to create a new user account with full application (/login.pl)
 privileges, leading to privilege escalation.  The vulnerability is patched
 in versions 1.10.30 and 1.11.9.
