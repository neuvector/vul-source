Description:
 The array_user_key_compare function in PHP 4.4.6 and earlier, and 5.x up to
 5.2.1, makes erroneous calls to zval_dtor, which triggers memory corruption
 and allows local users to bypass safe_mode and execute arbitrary code via a
 certain unset operation after array_user_key_compare has been called.
