Description:
 In Django 2.2 before 2.2.22, 3.1 before 3.1.10, and 3.2 before 3.2.2 (with
 Python 3.9.5+), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and tabs (unless
 the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values with
 newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is
 unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray| Requires Python 3.9.5 or greater which is only present in impish+
 mdeslaur> Python 3.9.5 is now being backported to focal+, so this now
 mdeslaur> needs to be fixed
 mdeslaur> While this was originally marked as not-affected for bionic, a
 mdeslaur> subsequent security update introduced the behaviour change in
 mdeslaur> bionic which resulted in this CVE needing to be fixed.
