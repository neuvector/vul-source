Description:
 Format string vulnerability in gedit 2.10.2 may allow attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application crash) via a bin file with format string
 specifiers in the filename.  NOTE: while this issue is triggered on the
 command line by the gedit user, it has been reported that web browsers and
 email clients could be configured to provide a file name as an argument to
 gedit, so there is a valid attack that crosses security boundaries.
