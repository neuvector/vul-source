Description:
 A privilege escalation attack was found in apport-cli 2.26.0 and earlier
 which is similar to CVE-2023-26604. If a system is specially configured to
 allow unprivileged users to run sudo apport-cli, less is configured as the
 pager, and the terminal size can be set: a local attacker can escalate
 privilege. It is extremely unlikely that a system administrator would
 configure sudo to allow unprivileged users to perform this class of
 exploit.
