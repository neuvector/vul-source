Description:
 If a malicious attacker has used another vulnerability to gain full control
 over a content process, they may be able to replace the alternate data
 resources stored in the JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache (JSBC) for other
 JavaScript code. If the parent process then runs this replaced code, the
 executed script would be run with the parent process' privileges, escaping
 the sandbox on content processes. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
