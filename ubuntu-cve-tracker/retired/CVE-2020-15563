Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 HVM guest OS
 users to cause a hypervisor crash. An inverted conditional in x86 HVM
 guests' dirty video RAM tracking code allows such guests to make Xen
 de-reference a pointer guaranteed to point at unmapped space. A malicious
 or buggy HVM guest may cause the hypervisor to crash, resulting in Denial
 of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Xen versions from 4.8 onwards
 are affected. Xen versions 4.7 and earlier are not affected. Only x86
 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests
 using shadow paging can leverage the vulnerability. In addition, there
 needs to be an entity actively monitoring a guest's video frame buffer
 (typically for display purposes) in order for such a guest to be able to
 leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV guests, as well as x86 HVM guests using
 hardware assisted paging (HAP), cannot leverage the vulnerability.
