Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The Flask-Caching extension through 1.10.1 for Flask relies
 on Pickle for serialization, which may lead to remote code execution or
 local privilege escalation. If an attacker gains access to cache storage
 (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can construct a crafted
 payload, poison the cache, and execute Python code. NOTE: a third party
 indicates that exploitation is extremely unlikely unless the machine is
 already compromised; in other cases, the attacker would be unable to write
 their payload to the cache and generate the required collision.
