Description:
 The Flask-Caching extension through 1.10.1 for Flask relies on Pickle for
 serialization, which may lead to remote code execution or local privilege
 escalation. If an attacker gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem,
 Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can construct a crafted payload, poison the
 cache, and execute Python code. NOTE: a third party indicates that
 exploitation is extremely unlikely unless the machine is already
 compromised; in other cases, the attacker would be unable to write their
 payload to the cache and generate the required collision
