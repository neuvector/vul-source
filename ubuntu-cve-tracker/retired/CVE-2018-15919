Description:
 Remotely observable behaviour in auth-gss2.c in OpenSSH through 7.8 could
 be used by remote attackers to detect existence of users on a target system
 when GSS2 is in use. NOTE: the discoverer states 'We understand that the
 OpenSSH developers do not want to treat such a username enumeration (or
 "oracle") as a vulnerability.'
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
 mdeslaur> SUSE reverted the fix for this issue because of a regression
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> per the post to oss-security, upstream doesn't conside this to
 mdeslaur> be a security issue, and as of 2020-07-07, there is no upstream
 mdeslaur> fix for this. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu.
