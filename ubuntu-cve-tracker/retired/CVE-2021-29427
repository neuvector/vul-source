Description:
 In Gradle from version 5.1 and before version 7.0 there is a vulnerability
 which can lead to information disclosure and/or dependency poisoning.
 Repository content filtering is a security control Gradle introduced to
 help users specify what repositories are used to resolve specific
 dependencies. This feature was introduced in the wake of the "A Confusing
 Dependency" blog post. In some cases, Gradle may ignore content filters and
 search all repositories for dependencies. This only occurs when repository
 content filtering is used from within a `pluginManagement` block in a
 settings file. This may change how dependencies are resolved for Gradle
 plugins and build scripts. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two
 risks: 1) Information disclosure: Gradle could make dependency requests to
 repositories outside your organization and leak internal package
 identifiers. 2) Dependency poisoning/Dependency confusion: Gradle could
 download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due
 to name squatting. For a full example and more details refer to the
 referenced GitHub Security Advisory. The problem has been patched and
 released with Gradle 7.0. Users relying on this feature should upgrade
 their build as soon as possible. As a workaround, users may use a company
 repository which has the right rules for fetching packages from public
 repositories, or use project level repository content filtering, inside
 `buildscript.repositories`. This option is available since Gradle 5.1 when
 the feature was introduced.
