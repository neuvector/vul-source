Description:
 functions/imap_general.php in SquirrelMail, as used in Red Hat Enterprise
 Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5, does not properly handle 8-bit characters in
 passwords, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disk
 consumption) by making many IMAP login attempts with different usernames,
 leading to the creation of many preference files.  NOTE: this issue exists
 because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2010-2813.
