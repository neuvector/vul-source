Description:
 Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which
 makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of
 random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a
 different child process, a related issue to CVE-2003-0900. NOTE: this issue
 exists because of a regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.
