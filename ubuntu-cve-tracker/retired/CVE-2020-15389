Description:
 jp2/opj_decompress.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a use-after-free that
 can be triggered if there is a mix of valid and invalid files in a
 directory operated on by the decompressor. Triggering a double-free may
 also be possible. This is related to calling opj_image_destroy twice.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenJPEG did not properly handle certain input. If
 OpenJPEG were supplied with specially crafted input, it could be made to crash
 or possibly execute arbitrary code.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> per upstream bug, this is a read after free, so likely limited
 mdeslaur> to a denial of service.
