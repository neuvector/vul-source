Description:
 The popup blocker in Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.7 opens the "blocked
 popups" display in the context of the Location bar instead of the subframe
 from which the popup originated, which might make it easier for remote
 user-assisted attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
