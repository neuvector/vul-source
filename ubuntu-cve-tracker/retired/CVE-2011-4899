Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in
 WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier does not ensure that the specified MySQL
 database service is appropriate, which allows remote attackers to configure
 an arbitrary database via the dbhost and dbname parameters, and
 subsequently conduct static code injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)
 attacks via (1) an HTTP request or (2) a MySQL query.  NOTE: the vendor
 disputes the significance of this issue; however, remote code execution
 makes the issue important in many realistic environments.
