Description:
 A flaw in handling fullscreen transitions may have inadvertently caused the
 application to become stuck in fullscreen mode when a modal dialog was
 opened during the transition. This issue left users unable to exit
 fullscreen mode using standard actions like pressing "Esc" or accessing
 right-click menus, resulting in a disrupted browsing experience until the
 browser is restarted. 
 *This bug only affects the application when running on macOS. Other
 operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox <
 133, Firefox ESR < 128.5, Thunderbird < 133, and Thunderbird < 128.5.
