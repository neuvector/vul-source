Description:
 MIT krb5 1.6 or later allows an authenticated kadmin with permission to add
 principals to an LDAP Kerberos database to circumvent a DN containership
 check by supplying both a "linkdn" and "containerdn" database argument, or
 by supplying a DN string which is a left extension of a container DN string
 but is not hierarchically within the container DN.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain database
 arguments. A remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue
 to obtain sensitive information.
