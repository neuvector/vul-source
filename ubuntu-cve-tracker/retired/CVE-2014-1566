Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 31.1 on Android does not properly restrict copying
 of local files onto the SD card during processing of file: URLs, which
 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from the Firefox profile
 directory via a crafted application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-1515.
