Description:
 In Xpdf 4.01.01, a buffer over-read could be triggered in
 FoFiType1C::convertToType1 in fofi/FoFiType1C.cc when the index number is
 larger than the charset array bounds. It can, for example, be triggered by
 sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftops tool. It allows an attacker
 to use a crafted pdf file to cause Denial of Service or an information
 leak, or possibly have unspecified other impact.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> xpdf in koffice is 2.0
 ebarretto> since 0.5.12-1 libextractor does not use xpdf anymore.
 ebarretto> xpdf in Debian uses poppler, which is not affected or fixed
