Description:
 The dtls1_clear_queues function in ssl/d1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za,
 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h frees data structures without
 considering that application data can arrive between a ChangeCipherSpec
 message and a Finished message, which allows remote DTLS peers to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via unexpected application data.
