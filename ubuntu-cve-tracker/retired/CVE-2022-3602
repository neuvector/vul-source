Description:
 A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
 specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
 certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have
 signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
 certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
 issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four
 attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result
 in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code
 execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would
 mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further
 mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
 Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL.
 Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above
 have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to
 upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be
 triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be
 triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious
 client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected
 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).
