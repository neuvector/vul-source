Description:
 A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_symlink_req in glusterfs server
 which allows symlink destinations to point to file paths outside of the
 gluster volume. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to create
 arbitrary symlinks pointing anywhere on the server and execute arbitrary
 code on glusterfs server nodes.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled RPC requests. An attacker
 could possibly use this issue to write iles to an arbitrary location and
 execute arbitrary code.
