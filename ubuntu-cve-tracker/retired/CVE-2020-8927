Description:
 A buffer overflow exists in the Brotli library versions prior to 1.0.8
 where an attacker controlling the input length of a "one-shot"
 decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when
 copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update
 your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend
 to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API, and impose
 chunk size limits.
