Description:
 WebKit/Source/devtools/front_end/devtools.js in the Developer Tools (aka
 DevTools) subsystem in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.79,
 does not ensure that the remoteFrontendUrl parameter is associated with a
 chrome-devtools-frontend.appspot.com URL, which allows remote attackers to
 bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted URL.
