Description:
 Laravel is a web application framework. Versions of Laravel before 6.20.11,
 7.30.2 and 8.22.1 contain a query binding exploitation. This same exploit
 applies to the illuminate/database package which is used by Laravel. If a
 request is crafted where a field that is normally a non-array value is an
 array, and that input is not validated or cast to its expected type before
 being passed to the query builder, an unexpected number of query bindings
 can be added to the query. In some situations, this will simply lead to no
 results being returned by the query builder; however, it is possible
 certain queries could be affected in a way that causes the query to return
 unexpected results.
