Description:
 A call to ConformPixelInfo() in the SetImageAlphaChannel() routine of
 /MagickCore/channel.c caused a subsequent heap-use-after-free or
 heap-buffer-overflow READ when GetPixelRed() or GetPixelBlue() was called.
 This could occur if an attacker is able to submit a malicious image file to
 be processed by ImageMagick and could lead to denial of service. It likely
 would not lead to anything further because the memory is used as pixel data
 and not e.g. a function pointer. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions
 prior to 7.0.9-0.
