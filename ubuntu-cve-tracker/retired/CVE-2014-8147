Description:
 The resolveImplicitLevels function in common/ubidi.c in the Unicode
 Bidirectional Algorithm implementation in ICU4C in International Components
 for Unicode (ICU) before 55.1 uses an integer data type that is
 inconsistent with a header file, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (incorrect malloc followed by invalid free) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via crafted text.
