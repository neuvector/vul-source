Description:
 Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete
 and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds write
 was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable function,
 `BmffImage::brotliUncompress`, is new in v0.28.0, so earlier versions of
 Exiv2 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds write is triggered when Exiv2
 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could
 potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can
 trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. This bug is
 fixed in version v0.28.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
