Description:
 Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
 deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read
 was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function,
 `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions
 before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when
 Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. In most cases
 this out of bounds read will result in a crash. This bug is fixed in
 version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
