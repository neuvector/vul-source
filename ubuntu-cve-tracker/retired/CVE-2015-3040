Description:
 Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.281 and 14.x through 17.x before
 17.0.0.169 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.457 on Linux does not
 properly restrict discovery of memory addresses, which allows attackers to
 bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via unspecified vectors, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2015-0357.
