Description:
 TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
 under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to
 host spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP Host header. TYPO3
 uses the HTTP Host header, for example, to generate absolute URLs during
 the frontend rendering process. Since the host header itself is provided by
 the client, it can be forged to any value, even in a name-based virtual
 hosts environment. This vulnerability is the same as described in
 TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001 (CVE-2014-3941). A regression, introduced during
 TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation. The already existing setting
 $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern'] (used as an
 effective mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not evaluated
 anymore, and reintroduced the vulnerability.
