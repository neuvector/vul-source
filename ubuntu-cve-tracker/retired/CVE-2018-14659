Description:
 The Gluster file system through versions 4.1.4 and 3.1.2 is vulnerable to a
 denial of service attack via use of the 'GF_XATTR_IOSTATS_DUMP_KEY' xattr.
 A remote, authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a Gluster
 volume and repeatedly calling 'setxattr(2)' to trigger a state dump and
 create an arbitrary number of files in the server's runtime directory.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled certain files. A remote
 authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to create arbitrary
 files.
