Description:
 setup/lib/ConfigGenerator.class.php in phpMyAdmin 3.x before 3.3.10.2 and
 3.4.x before 3.4.3.1 does not properly restrict the presence of comment
 closing delimiters, which allows remote attackers to conduct static code
 injection attacks by leveraging the ability to modify the SESSION
 superglobal array.
