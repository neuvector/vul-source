Description:
 When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs
 enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the
 Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a
 specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it
 contained would be executed by the server.
