Description:
 Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the (1)
 DCTStream::readProgressiveSOF and (2) DCTStream::readBaselineSOF functions
 in the DCT stream parsing code (Stream.cc) in xpdf 3.01 and earlier, as
 used in products such as (a) Poppler, (b) teTeX, (c) KDE kpdf, (d)
 pdftohtml, (e) KOffice KWord, (f) CUPS, and (g) libextractor allow
 user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (heap corruption) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file with an out-of-range
 number of components (numComps), which is used as an array index.
