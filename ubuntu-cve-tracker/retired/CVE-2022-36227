 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7070-1
Description:
 In libarchive before 3.6.2, the software does not check for an error after
 calling calloc function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function
 fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: the
 discoverer cites this CWE-476 remark but third parties dispute the
 code-execution impact: "In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to
 the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or
 reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution."
