Description:
 The PRNG implementation in the DNS resolver in Mozilla Firefox (aka Fennec)
 before 37.0 on Android does not properly generate random numbers for query
 ID values and UDP source ports, which makes it easier for remote attackers
 to spoof DNS responses by guessing these numbers, a related issue to
 CVE-2012-2808.
