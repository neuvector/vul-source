Description:
 An integer overflow was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's
 paravirtual RDMA device in versions prior to 6.1.0. The issue occurs while
 handling a "PVRDMA_REG_DSRHIGH" write from the guest due to improper input
 validation. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to make QEMU allocate
 a large amount of memory, resulting in a denial of service. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
