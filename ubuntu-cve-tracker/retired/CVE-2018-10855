Description:
 Ansible 2.5 prior to 2.5.5, and 2.4 prior to 2.4.5, do not honor the no_log
 task flag for failed tasks. When the no_log flag has been used to protect
 sensitive data passed to a task from being logged, and that task does not
 run successfully, Ansible will expose sensitive data in log files and on
 the terminal of the user running Ansible.
