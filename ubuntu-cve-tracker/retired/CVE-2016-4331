Description:
 When decoding data out of a dataset encoded with the H5Z_NBIT decoding, the
 HDF5 1.8.16 library will fail to ensure that the precision is within the
 bounds of the size leading to arbitrary code execution.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that HDF5 incorrectly handled decoding of data. An
 attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.
