Description:
 Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier bundled a version of the
 commons-httpclient library with the vulnerability CVE-2012-6153 that
 incorrectly verified SSL certificates, making it susceptible to
 man-in-the-middle attacks. This library is widely used as a transitive
 dependency in Jenkins plugins. The fix for CVE-2012-6153 was backported to
 the version of commons-httpclient that is bundled in core and made
 available to plugins.
