Description:
 An issue was discovered in rcp in MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3. Due to the
 rcp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which
 files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only
 performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory
 traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious rcp server (or
 Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rcp client
 target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can
 manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the
 .ssh/authorized_keys file). This issue is similar to CVE-2019-6111 and
 CVE-2019-7283. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl is not supported upstream but is shipped
 by a few Linux distributions. The affected code was removed from the
 supported MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) product many years ago, at version 1.8.
