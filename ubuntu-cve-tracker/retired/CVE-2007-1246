Description:
 The DMO_VideoDecoder_Open function in loader/dmo/DMO_VideoDecoder.c in
 MPlayer 1.0rc1 and earlier, as used in xine-lib, does not set the biSize
 before use in a memcpy, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to
 cause a buffer overflow and possibly execute arbitrary code, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2007-1387.
