Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 37.0 does not require an HTTPS session for
 lightweight theme add-on installations, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to bypass an intended user-confirmation requirement by deploying
 a crafted web site and conducting a DNS spoofing attack against a
 mozilla.org subdomain.
