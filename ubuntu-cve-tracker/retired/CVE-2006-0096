Description:
 wan/sdla.c in Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.11 and 2.4.x before 2.4.29 does
 not require the CAP_SYS_RAWIO privilege for an SDLA firmware upgrade, with
 unknown impact and local attack vectors.  NOTE: further investigation
 suggests that this issue requires root privileges to exploit, since it is
 protected by CAP_NET_ADMIN; thus it might not be a vulnerability, although
 capabilities provide finer distinctions between privilege levels.
