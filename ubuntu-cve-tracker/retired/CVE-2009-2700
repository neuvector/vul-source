Description:
 src/network/ssl/qsslcertificate.cpp in Nokia Trolltech Qt 4.x does not
 properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject
 Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted
 certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue
 to CVE-2009-2408.
