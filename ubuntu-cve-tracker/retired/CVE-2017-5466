Description:
 If a page is loaded from an original site through a hyperlink and contains
 a redirect to a "data:text/html" URL, triggering a reload will run the
 reloaded "data:text/html" page with its origin set incorrectly. This allows
 for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This vulnerability affects
 Thunderbird < 52.1, Firefox ESR < 52.1, and Firefox < 53.
