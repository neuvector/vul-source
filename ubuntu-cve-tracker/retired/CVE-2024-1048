Description:
 A flaw was found in the grub2-set-bootflag utility of grub2. After the fix
 of CVE-2019-14865, grub2-set-bootflag will create a temporary file with the
 new grubenv content and rename it to the original grubenv file. If the
 program is killed before the rename operation, the temporary file will not
 be removed and may fill the filesystem when invoked multiple times,
 resulting in a filesystem out of free inodes or blocks.
