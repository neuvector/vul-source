Description:
 A flaw was found in stunnel before 5.57, where it improperly validates
 client certificates when it is configured to use both redirect and
 verifyChain options. This flaw allows an attacker with a certificate signed
 by a Certificate Authority, which is not the one accepted by the stunnel
 server, to access the tunneled service instead of being redirected to the
 address specified in the redirect option. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to confidentiality.
Ubuntu-Description:
