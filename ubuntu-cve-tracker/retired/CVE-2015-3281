Description:
 The buffer_slow_realign function in HAProxy 1.5.x before 1.5.14 and 1.6-dev
 does not properly realign a buffer that is used for pending outgoing data,
 which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
 (uninitialized memory contents of previous requests) via a crafted request.
