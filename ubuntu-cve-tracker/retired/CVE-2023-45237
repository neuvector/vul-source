Notes:
 mdeslaur> This CVE was originally fixed by USN-7894-1, but it introduced a
 mdeslaur> regression in network boot and was reverted by USN-7894-2.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The fix for this issue results in a behavioural change that
 mdeslaur> requires guests to have a random network generator (virtio-rng).
 mdeslaur> Since this is a behavioural change, we are not able to fix this
 mdeslaur> CVE in stable releases. Marking as ignored.
