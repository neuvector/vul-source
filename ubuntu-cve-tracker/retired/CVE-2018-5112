Description:
 Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the
 panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this
 requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the
 development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not
 be able to access, including potentially privileged pages. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
