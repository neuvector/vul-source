Description:
 Race condition in the _get_masked_mode function in Lib/os.py in Python 3.2
 through 3.5, when exist_ok is set to true and multiple threads are used,
 might allow local users to bypass intended file permissions by leveraging a
 separate application vulnerability before the umask has been set to the
 expected value.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> The upstream patch uses umask(0022) instead of umask(0) -- which
  seems as bad as the original behaviour. We should see if there is an updated
  patch when we prepare our packages that replaces the bad code.
 mdeslaur> introduced by the fix for http://bugs.python.org/issue9299
 mdeslaur> upstream commited a better fix than the proposed one in the bug
 mdeslaur> but it now changes behavour
