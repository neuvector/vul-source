Description:
 An issue was discovered in Linux Containers (LXC) before 2016-02-22. When
 executing a program via lxc-attach, the nonpriv session can escape to the
 parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the
 terminal's input buffer, allowing an attacker to escape the container.
