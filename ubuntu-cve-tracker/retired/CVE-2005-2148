Description:
 Cacti 0.8.6e and earlier does not perform proper input validation to
 protect against common attacks, which allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary commands or SQL by sending a legitimate value in a POST request
 or cookie, then specifying the attack string in the URL, which causes the
 get_request_var function to return the wrong value in the $_REQUEST
 variable, which is cleansed while the original malicious $_GET value
 remains unmodified, as demonstrated in (1) graph_image.php and (2)
 graph.php.
