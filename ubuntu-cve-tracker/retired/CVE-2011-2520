Description:
 fw_dbus.py in system-config-firewall 1.2.29 and earlier uses the pickle
 Python module unsafely during D-Bus communication between the GUI and the
 backend, which might allow local users to gain privileges via a crafted
 serialized object.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> This is actually a flaw in the system-config-firewall backend.
 mdeslaur> system-config-printer opens pickles from the backend, but
 mdeslaur> since we don't ship the backend (system-config-firewall),
 mdeslaur> we're not affected.
