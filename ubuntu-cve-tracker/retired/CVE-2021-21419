Description:
 Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket peer
 may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames.
 Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly
 compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame
 to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS
 limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no
 workaround to protect Eventlet process.
