Description:
 In Gradle before version 7.0, files created with open permissions in the
 system temporary directory can allow an attacker to access information
 downloaded by Gradle. Some builds could be vulnerable to a local
 information disclosure. Remote files accessed through TextResourceFactory
 are downloaded into the system temporary directory first. Sensitive
 information contained in these files can be exposed to other local users on
 the same system. If you do not use the `TextResourceFactory` API, you are
 not vulnerable. As of Gradle 7.0, uses of the system temporary directory
 have been moved to the Gradle User Home directory. By default, this
 directory is restricted to the user running the build. As a workaround, set
 a more restrictive umask that removes read access to other users. When
 files are created in the system temporary directory, they will not be
 accessible to other users. If you are unable to change your system's umask,
 you can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property
 `java.io.tmpdir`. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user
 only.
