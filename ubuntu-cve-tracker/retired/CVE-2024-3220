Description:
 There is a defect in the CPython standard library module “mimetypes” where
 on Windows the default list of known file locations are writable meaning
 other users can create invalid files to cause MemoryError to be raised on
 Python runtime startup or have file extensions be interpreted as the
 incorrect file type.
 
 This defect is caused by the default locations of Linux and macOS platforms
 (such as “/etc/mime.types”) also being used on Windows, where they are
 user-writable locations (“C:\etc\mime.types”).
 
 To work-around this issue a user can call mimetypes.init() with an empty
 list (“[]”) on Windows platforms to avoid using the default list of known
 file locations.
