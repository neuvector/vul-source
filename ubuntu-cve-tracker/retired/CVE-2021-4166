Description:
 vim is vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> code in bionic and earlier does not include file src/arglist.c, which 
 ccdm94> is the patched file. The patched code for these releases seems to be 
 ccdm94> instead present in src/buffer.c, as seen in commit 4ad62155a10.
 ccdm94> Changes that led to the creation of file arglist.c and changes made 
 ccdm94> to the code that follow the creation of this file are significant,
 ccdm94> which would result in an intrusive backport should the altered CVE 
 ccdm94> patch and other necessary changes be applied in bionic and earlier. 
 ccdm94> Consequently, the issue will be marked as ignored for the previously
 ccdm94> mentioned releases.
