Description:
 An issue in Python cpython v.3.7 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive
 information via the _asyncio._swap_current_task component. NOTE: this is
 disputed by the vendor because (1) neither 3.7 nor any other release is
 affected (it is a bug in some 3.12 pre-releases); (2) there are no common
 scenarios in which an adversary can call _asyncio._swap_current_task but
 does not already have the ability to call arbitrary functions; and (3)
 there are no common scenarios in which sensitive information, which is not
 already accessible to an adversary, becomes accessible through this bug.
