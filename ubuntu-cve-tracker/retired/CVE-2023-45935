Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Qt 6 through 6.6 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer
 dereference via the function QXcbConnection::initializeAllAtoms(). NOTE:
 this is disputed because it is not expected that an X application should
 continue to run when there is arbitrary anomalous behavior from the X
 server.
