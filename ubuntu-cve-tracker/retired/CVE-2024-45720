Description:
 On Windows platforms, a "best fit" character encoding conversion of command
 line arguments to Subversion's executables (e.g., svn.exe, etc.) may lead
 to unexpected command line argument interpretation, including argument
 injection and execution of other programs, if a specially crafted command
 line argument string is processed.
 
 All versions of Subversion up to and including Subversion 1.14.3 are
 affected on Windows platforms only. Users are recommended to upgrade to
 version Subversion 1.14.4, which fixes this issue.
 
 Subversion is not affected on UNIX-like platforms.
