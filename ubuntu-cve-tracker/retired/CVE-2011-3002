Description:
 Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE), as used in Mozilla Firefox
 before 7.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.4, does not validate the return value of
 a GrowAtomTable function call, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
 via vectors that trigger a memory-allocation error and a resulting buffer
 overflow.
