Description:
 Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice
 "LibreOfficeKit" mode disables TLS certification verification
 LibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality through
 C/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuse
 LibreOffice as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact with
 documents. LibreOffice internally makes use of "curl" to fetch remote
 resources such as images hosted on webservers. In affected versions of
 LibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode only, then curl's TLS
 certification verification was disabled (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)
 In the fixed versions curl operates in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as in
 standard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true. This issue affects
 LibreOffice before version 24.2.4.
