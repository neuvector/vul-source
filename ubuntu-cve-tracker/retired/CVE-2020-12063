Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A certain Postfix 2.10.1-7 package could allow an attacker
 to send an email from an arbitrary-looking sender via a homoglyph attack,
 as demonstrated by the similarity of \xce\xbf to the 'o' character. This is
 potentially relevant when the /etc/postfix/sender_login feature is used,
 because a spoofed outbound message that uses a configured sender address is
 blocked with a "Sender address rejected: not logged in" error message, but
 a spoofed outbound message that uses a homoglyph of a configured sender
 address is not blocked. NOTE: some third parties argue that any missed
 blocking of spoofed outbound messages - except for exact matches to a
 sender address in the /etc/postfix/sender_login file - is outside the
 design goals of Postfix and thus cannot be considered a Postfix
 vulnerability.
