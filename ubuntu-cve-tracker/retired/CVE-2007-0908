Description:
 The WDDX deserializer in the wddx extension in PHP 5 before 5.2.1 and PHP 4
 before 4.4.5 does not properly initialize the key_length variable for a
 numerical key, which allows context-dependent attackers to read stack
 memory via a wddxPacket element that contains a variable with a string name
 before a numerical variable.
