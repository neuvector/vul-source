Description:
 An issue was discovered in gif2apng 1.9. There is a heap-based buffer
 overflow within the main function. It allows an attacker to write data
 outside of the allocated buffer. The attacker has control over a part of
 the address that data is written to, control over the written data, and (to
 some extent) control over the amount of data that is written.
