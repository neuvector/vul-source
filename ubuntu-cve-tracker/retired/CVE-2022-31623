Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of
 Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e.,
 going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads,
 the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local
 users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor
 argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with
 adverse effects.
