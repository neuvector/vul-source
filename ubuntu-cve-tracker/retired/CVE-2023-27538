Description:
 An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl prior to v8.0.0
 where it reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the fact
 that an SSH option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurl
 maintains a pool of previously used connections to reuse them for
 subsequent transfers if the configurations match. However, two SSH settings
 were omitted from the configuration check, allowing them to match easily,
 potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.
