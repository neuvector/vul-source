Description:
 Buffer overflow in the SQLDriverConnect function in unixODBC 2.0.10, 2.3.1,
 and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
 long string in the FILEDSN option. NOTE: this issue might not be a
 vulnerability, since the ability to set this option typically implies that
 the attacker already has legitimate access to cause a DoS or execute code,
 and therefore the issue would not cross privilege boundaries. There may be
 limited attack scenarios if isql command-line options are exposed to an
 attacker, although it seems likely that other, more serious issues would
 also be exposed, and this issue might not cross privilege boundaries in
 that context.
