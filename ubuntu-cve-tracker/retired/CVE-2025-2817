Description:
 Thunderbird's update mechanism allowed a medium-integrity user process to
 interfere with the SYSTEM-level updater by manipulating the file-locking
 behavior. By injecting code into the user-privileged process, an attacker
 could bypass intended access controls, allowing SYSTEM-level file
 operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling
 privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 138, Firefox ESR
 < 128.10, Firefox ESR < 115.23, Thunderbird < 138, and Thunderbird <
 128.10.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> mozjs* contain a copy of the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine. It
 mdeslaur> is not feasible to backport security fixes to the mozjs*
 mdeslaur> packages, as such, marking them as ignored.
 mdeslaur> starting with Ubuntu 22.04, the firefox package is just a script
 mdeslaur> that installs the Firefox snap
 mdeslaur> starting with Ubuntu 24.04, the thunderbird package is just a
 mdeslaur> script that installs the Thunderbird snap
