Description:
 Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for
 rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers &
 clients. In netty-codec-compression versions 4.1.124.Final and below, and
 netty-codec versions 4.2.4.Final and below, when supplied with specially
 crafted input, BrotliDecoder and certain other decompression decoders will
 allocate a large number of reachable byte buffers, which can lead to denial
 of service. BrotliDecoder.decompress has no limit in how often it calls
 pull, decompressing data 64K bytes at a time. The buffers are saved in the
 output list, and remain reachable until OOM is hit. This is fixed in
 versions 4.1.125.Final of netty-codec and 4.2.5.Final of
 netty-codec-compression.
