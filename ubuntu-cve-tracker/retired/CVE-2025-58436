Description:
 OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other
 Unix-like operating systems. Prior to version 2.4.15, a client that
 connects to cupsd but sends slow messages, e.g. only one byte per second,
 delays cupsd as a whole, such that it becomes unusable by other clients.
 This issue has been patched in version 2.4.15.
