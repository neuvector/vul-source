Description:
 The setGlobalContext method in
 org/apache/naming/factory/ResourceLinkFactory.java in Apache Tomcat 7.x
 before 7.0.68, 8.x before 8.0.31, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M3 does not consider
 whether ResourceLinkFactory.setGlobalContext callers are authorized, which
 allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager
 restrictions and read or write to arbitrary application data, or cause a
 denial of service (application disruption), via a web application that sets
 a crafted global context.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the Tomcat setGlobalContext method incorrectly
 checked if callers were authorized. A remote attacker could possibly use
 this issue to read or wite to arbitrary application data, or cause a denial
 of service.
