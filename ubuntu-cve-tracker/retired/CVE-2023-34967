Description:
 A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for
 Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets, one encoded data
 structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character
 strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the mdssvc
 protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the
 dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with a
 key, a caller may trigger a crash in talloc_get_size() when talloc detects
 that the passed-in pointer is not a valid talloc pointer. With an RPC
 worker process shared among multiple client connections, a malicious client
 or attacker can trigger a process crash in a shared RPC mdssvc worker
 process, affecting all other clients this worker serves.

Notes:
 sbeattie> Spotlight functionality first enabled in 4.13.x in Ubuntu
