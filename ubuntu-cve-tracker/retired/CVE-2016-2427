Description:
 The AES-GCM specification in RFC 5084, as used in Android 5.x and 6.x,
 recommends 12 octets for the aes-ICVlen parameter field, which might make
 it easier for attackers to defeat a cryptographic protection mechanism and
 discover an authentication key via a crafted application, aka internal bug
 26234568.  NOTE: The vendor disputes the existence of this potential issue
 in Android, stating "This CVE was raised in error: it referred to the
 authentication tag size in GCM, whose default according to ASN.1 encoding
 (12 bytes) can lead to vulnerabilities. After careful consideration, it was
 decided that the insecure default value of 12 bytes was a default only for
 the encoding and not default anywhere else in Android, and hence no
 vulnerability existed.
