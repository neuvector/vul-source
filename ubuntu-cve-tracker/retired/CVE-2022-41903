Description:
 Git is distributed revision control system. `git log` can display commits
 in an arbitrary format using its `--format` specifiers. This functionality
 is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute. When
 processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in
 `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly
 as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can
 be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit
 formatting machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also be
 triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism,
 which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository
 during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap
 writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been
 patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7.
 Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should
 disable `git archive` in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive
 via `git daemon`, disable it by running `git config --global
 daemon.uploadArch false`.
