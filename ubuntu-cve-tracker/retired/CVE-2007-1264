Description:
 Enigmail 0.94.2 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument
 when invoking GnuPG, which prevents Enigmail from visually distinguishing
 between signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple
 components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a
 message without detection.
