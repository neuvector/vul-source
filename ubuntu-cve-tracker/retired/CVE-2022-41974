Description:
 multipath-tools 0.7.0 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to
 obtain root access, as exploited alone or in conjunction with
 CVE-2022-41973. Local users able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass
 access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This can lead to local
 privilege escalation to root. This occurs because an attacker can repeat a
 keyword, which is mishandled because arithmetic ADD is used instead of
 bitwise OR.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray| introduced in version 0.7.0 via commit 9acda0c but earlier
  versions do no authorization checks at all and are then technically also
  vulnerable
 rodrigo-zaiden> earlier versions are not getting a code fix for this and
  applying one without upstream support does not seem feasible and can add
  too much risks.
