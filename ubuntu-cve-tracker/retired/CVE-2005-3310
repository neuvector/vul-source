Description:
 Interpretation conflict in phpBB 2.0.17, with remote avatars and avatar
 uploading enabled, allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary
 web script or HTML via an HTML file with a GIF or JPEG file extension,
 which causes the HTML to be executed by a victim who views the file in
 Internet Explorer, which renders malformed image types as HTML, enabling
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  NOTE: it could be argued that this
 vulnerability is due to a design flaw in Internet Explorer (CVE-2005-3312)
 and the proper fix should be in that browser; if so, then this should not
 be treated as a vulnerability in phpBB.
