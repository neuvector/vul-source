Description:
 fs.openAsBlob() can bypass the experimental permission model when using the
 file system read restriction with the `--allow-fs-read` flag in Node.js 20.
 This flaw arises from a missing check in the `fs.openAsBlob()` API.
 
 Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is
 an experimental feature of Node.js.
