Description:
 The transit path validation code in Heimdal before 7.3 might allow
 attackers to bypass the capath policy protection mechanism by leveraging
 failure to add the previous hop realm to the transit path of issued
 tickets.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ratliff> Upstream: "[the fix] may break sites that rely on the bug."
 mdeslaur> heimdal-kdc package is in universe
 ccdm94> in the commit that fixes this issue, upstream mentions that
 ccdm94> there might be applications that use this bug as a "feature"
 ccdm94> when sometimes authenticating in cross-realm configurations,
 ccdm94> meaning that applying the proposed fix could end up breaking
 ccdm94> said applications. In order to avoid regressions for
 ccdm94> applications that use heimdal in xenial and earlier, this
 ccdm94> issue will be marked as ignored for those releases.
