Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. When moving IRQs between CPUs to
 distribute the load of IRQ handling, IRQ vectors are dynamically allocated
 and de-allocated on the relevant CPUs. De-allocation has to happen when
 certain constraints are met. If these conditions are not met when first
 checked, the checking CPU may send an interrupt to itself, in the
 expectation that this IRQ will be delivered only after the condition
 preventing the cleanup has cleared. For two specific IRQ vectors, this
 expectation was violated, resulting in a continuous stream of
 self-interrupts, which renders the CPU effectively unusable. A domain with
 a passed through PCI device can cause lockup of a physical CPU, resulting
 in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire host. Only x86 systems are
 vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only guests with physical PCI
 devices passed through to them can exploit the vulnerability.
