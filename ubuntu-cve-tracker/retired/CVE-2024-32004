Description:
 Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4,
 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, an attacker can prepare a local
 repository in such a way that, when cloned, will execute arbitrary code
 during the operation. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1,
 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a workaround, avoid
 cloning repositories from untrusted sources.
