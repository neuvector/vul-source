Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova before 23.2.2, 24.x before
 24.1.2, and 25.x before 25.0.2. By creating a neutron port with the direct
 vnic_type, creating an instance bound to that port, and then changing the
 vnic_type of the bound port to macvtap, an authenticated user may cause the
 compute service to fail to restart, resulting in a possible denial of
 service. Only Nova deployments configured with SR-IOV are affected.
