Description:
 The ssl3_get_key_exchange function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd,
 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote SSL servers to
 conduct RSA-to-EXPORT_RSA downgrade attacks and facilitate brute-force
 decryption by offering a weak ephemeral RSA key in a noncompliant role,
 related to the "FREAK" issue.  NOTE: the scope of this CVE is only client
 code based on OpenSSL, not EXPORT_RSA issues associated with servers or
 other TLS implementations.
