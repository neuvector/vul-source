Description:
 An out-of-bounds array read in the apr_time_exp*() functions was fixed in
 the Apache Portable Runtime 1.6.3 release (CVE-2017-12613). The fix for
 this issue was not carried forward to the APR 1.7.x branch, and hence
 version 1.7.0 regressed compared to 1.6.3 and is vulnerable to the same
 issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 leosilva> the fix was removed in 1.7.x branches, but it is addressed
 leosilva> in 1.6.x and later.
