Description:
 The fmtstr function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s
 and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g improperly calculates string lengths, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (overflow and out-of-bounds
 read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as
 demonstrated by a large amount of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability
 than CVE-2016-2842.
