Description:
 An issue was discovered in the Tatsuya Kinoshita w3m fork before 0.5.3-31.
 The feed_table_tag function in w3m doesn't properly validate the value of
 table span, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (stack and/or heap buffer overflow) and possibly execute arbitrary code via
 a crafted HTML page.
