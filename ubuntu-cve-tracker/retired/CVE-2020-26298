Description:
 Redcarpet is a Ruby library for Markdown processing. In Redcarpet before
 version 3.5.1, there is an injection vulnerability which can enable a
 cross-site scripting attack. In affected versions no HTML escaping was
 being performed when processing quotes. This applies even when the
 `:escape_html` option was being used. This is fixed in version 3.5.1 by the
 referenced commit.
