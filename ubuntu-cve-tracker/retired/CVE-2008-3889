Description:
 Postfix 2.4 before 2.4.9, 2.5 before 2.5.5, and 2.6 before 2.6-20080902,
 when used with the Linux 2.6 kernel, leaks epoll file descriptors during
 execution of "non-Postfix" commands, which allows local users to cause a
 denial of service (application slowdown or exit) via a crafted command, as
 demonstrated by a command in a .forward file.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Wietse Venema discovered that Postfix leaked internal file descriptors
 when executing non-Postfix commands.  A local attacker could exploit
 this to cause Postfix to run out of descriptors, leading to a denial
 of service.
