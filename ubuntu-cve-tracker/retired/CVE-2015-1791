Description:
 Race condition in the ssl3_get_new_session_ticket function in ssl/s3_clnt.c
 in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and
 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b, when used for a multi-threaded client, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (double free and application crash)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact by providing a NewSessionTicket
 during an attempt to reuse a ticket that had been obtained earlier.
