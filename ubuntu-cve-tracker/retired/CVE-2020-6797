Description:
 By downloading a file with the .fileloc extension, a semi-privileged
 extension could launch an arbitrary application on the user's computer. The
 attacker is restricted as they are unable to download non-quarantined files
 or supply command line arguments to the application, limiting the impact.
 Note: this issue only occurs on Mac OSX. Other operating systems are
 unaffected. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73,
 and Firefox < ESR68.5.
