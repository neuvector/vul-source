Description:
 The wddx_deserialize function in wddx.c 1.119.2.10.2.12 and 1.119.2.10.2.13
 in PHP 5, as modified in CVS on 20070224 and fixed on 20070304, calls
 strlcpy where strlcat was intended and uses improper arguments, which
 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a WDDX
 packet with a malformed overlap of a STRING element, which triggers a
 buffer overflow.
