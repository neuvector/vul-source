Description:
 The TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2, as used in
 OpenSSL, OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products, do not properly consider
 timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the
 processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to
 conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via
 statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the "Lucky
 Thirteen" issue.
