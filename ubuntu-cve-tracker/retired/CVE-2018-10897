Description:
 A directory traversal issue was found in reposync, a part of yum-utils,
 where reposync fails to sanitize paths in remote repository configuration
 files. If an attacker controls a repository, they may be able to copy files
 outside of the destination directory on the targeted system via path
 traversal. If reposync is running with heightened privileges on a targeted
 system, this flaw could potentially result in system compromise via the
 overwriting of critical system files. Version 1.1.31 and older are believed
 to be affected.
