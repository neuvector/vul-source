Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the read_channel_data function in file-psp.c
 in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a PSP_COMP_RLE (aka RLE compression) image file that
 begins a long run count at the end of the image.  NOTE: some of these
 details are obtained from third party information.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-4543.
