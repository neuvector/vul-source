Description:
 The Pickle::Pickle function in base/pickle.cc in Google Chrome before
 8.0.552.224 and Chrome OS before 8.0.552.343 on 64-bit Linux platforms does
 not properly perform pointer arithmetic, which allows remote attackers to
 bypass message deserialization validation, and cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact, via invalid pickle data.
