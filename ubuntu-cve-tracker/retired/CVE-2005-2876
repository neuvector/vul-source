Description:
 umount in util-linux 2.8 to 2.12q, 2.13-pre1, and 2.13-pre2, and other
 packages such as loop-aes-utils, allows local users with unmount
 permissions to gain privileges via the -r (remount) option, which causes
 the file system to be remounted with just the read-only flag, which
 effectively clears the nosuid, nodev, and other flags.
