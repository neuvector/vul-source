Description:
 The urllib3 library 1.26.x before 1.26.4 for Python omits SSL certificate
 validation in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies. The initial
 connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via
 proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means
 certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the
 default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the python-pip package bundles python-urllib3 binaries
 mdeslaur> when built. After updating python-urllib3, a no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuild of python-pip is required.
