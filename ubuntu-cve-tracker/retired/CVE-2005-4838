Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the example web
 applications for Jakarta Tomcat 5.5.6 and earlier allow remote attackers to
 inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) el/functions.jsp, (2)
 el/implicit-objects.jsp, and (3) jspx/textRotate.jspx in examples/jsp2/, as
 demonstrated via script in a request to snp/snoop.jsp. NOTE: other XSS
 issues in the manager were simultaneously reported, but these require admin
 access and do not cross privilege boundaries.
