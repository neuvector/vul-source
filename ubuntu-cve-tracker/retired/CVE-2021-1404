Description:
 A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)
 Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated,
 remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected
 device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may
 result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An
 exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to
 crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
