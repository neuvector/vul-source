Description:
 The Ubuntu edk2 UEFI firmware packages accidentally allowed the UEFI Shell
 to be accessed in Secure Boot environments, possibly allowing bypass of
 Secure Boot constraints. Versions 2024.05-2ubuntu0.3 and 2024.02-2ubuntu0.3
 disable the Shell. Some previous versions inserted a secure-boot-based
 decision to continue running inside the Shell itself, which is believed to
 be sufficient to enforce Secure Boot restrictions. This is an additional
 repair on top of the incomplete fix for CVE-2023-48733.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> incomplete fix for CVE-2023-48733
 mdeslaur> In response to CVE-2023-48733, a different patch was backported
 mdeslaur> to Jammy and Focal, that merely disables the Shell, but does not
 mdeslaur> remove it, which did apply to AAVMF as well, hence only Noble,
 mdeslaur> Oracular, and Plucky are vulnerable.
