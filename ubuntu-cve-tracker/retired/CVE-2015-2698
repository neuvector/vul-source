Description:
 The iakerb_gss_export_sec_context function in lib/gssapi/krb5/iakerb.c in
 MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.14 pre-release 2015-09-14 improperly accesses a
 certain pointer, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
 of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
 interacting with an application that calls the gss_export_sec_context
 function.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for
 CVE-2015-2696.
