Description:
 git-annex had a bug in the S3 and Glacier remotes where if embedcreds=yes
 was set, and the remote used encryption=pubkey or encryption=hybrid,
 the embedded AWS credentials were stored in the git repository
 in (effectively) plaintext, not encrypted as they were supposed to be. This
 issue affects git-annex: from 3.20121126 before 5.20140919.
