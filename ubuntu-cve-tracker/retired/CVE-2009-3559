Description:
 main/streams/plain_wrapper.c in PHP 5.3.x before 5.3.1 does not recognize
 the safe_mode_include_dir directive, which allows context-dependent
 attackers to have an unknown impact by triggering the failure of PHP
 scripts that perform include or require operations, as demonstrated by a
 script that attempts to perform a require_once on a file in a standard
 library directory. NOTE: a reliable third party reports that this is not a
 vulnerability, because it results in a more restrictive security policy.
