Description:
 [Unknown description]
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> needs a better triage, debian have:
  "Doesn't affect any released version of glibc" but I'm not
  sure if Noble and Oracular are affected or not.
 hlibk> Per the fedora bug report, this seems to be an issue that got
  caught during the 2.41 development, and is not an issue in upstream
  releases. Therefore, Ubuntu releases don't seem to be affected.
