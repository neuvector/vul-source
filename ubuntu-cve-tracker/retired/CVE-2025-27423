Description:
 Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Vim is distributed with
 the tar.vim plugin, that allows easy editing and viewing of (compressed or
 uncompressed) tar files. Starting with 9.1.0858, the tar.vim plugin uses
 the ":read" ex command line to append below the cursor position, however
 the is not sanitized and is taken literally from the tar archive. This
 allows to execute shell commands via special crafted tar archives. Whether
 this really happens, depends on the shell being used ('shell' option, which
 is set using $SHELL). The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1164
