Description:
 Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.1947,
 an uncontrolled search path vulnerability on Windows allows Vim to execute
 malicious executables placed in the current working directory for the
 current edited file. On Windows, when using cmd.exe as a shell, Vim
 resolves external commands by searching the current working directory
 before system paths. When Vim invokes tools such as findstr for :grep,
 external commands or filters via :!, or compiler/:make commands, it may
 inadvertently run a malicious executable present in the same directory as
 the file being edited. The issue affects Vim for Windows prior to version
 9.1.1947.
