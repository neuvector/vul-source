Description:
 An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin.
 Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in
 an out-of-bounds read. A malicious user, server, or man-in-the-middle
 attacker can send an invalid size for a file transfer which will trigger an
 out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This could result in a denial of service
 or copy data from memory to the file, resulting in an information leak if
 the file is sent to another user.
