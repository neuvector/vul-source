Description:
 PHP 4.x and 5.x before 5.2.1, when running on multi-threaded systems, does
 not ensure thread safety for libc crypt function calls using protection
 schemes such as a mutex, which creates race conditions that allow remote
 attackers to overwrite internal program memory and gain system access.
