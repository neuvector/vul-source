Description:
 Squid 3.1.9 allows remote attackers to bypass the access configuration for
 the CONNECT method by providing an arbitrary allowed hostname in the Host
 HTTP header.  NOTE: this issue might not be reproducible, because the
 researcher is unable to provide a squid.conf file for a vulnerable system,
 and the observed behavior is consistent with a squid.conf file that was
 (perhaps inadvertently) designed to allow access based on a "req_header
 Host" acl regex that matches www.uol.com.br
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Need to check, see reproducer in original post
 sbeattie> dropping to low, as it requires a specific configuration
 sbeattie> using Host header filtering
 sbeattie> also, upstream does not have a fix for this.
 seth-arnold> still unable to find a configuration that could demonstrate the
 seth-arnold> problem; as of 2013-01-28, no fix from upstream either.
 mdeslaur> Disputed, so ignored.
