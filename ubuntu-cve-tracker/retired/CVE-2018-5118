Description:
 The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when
 a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was
 discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through
 "file:" URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the
 sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that
 escapes sandbox protections. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
