Description:
 The TS_OBJ_print_bio function in crypto/ts/ts_lib.c in the X.509 Public Key
 Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) implementation in OpenSSL through
 1.0.2h allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
 read and application crash) via a crafted time-stamp file that is
 mishandled by the "openssl ts" command.
