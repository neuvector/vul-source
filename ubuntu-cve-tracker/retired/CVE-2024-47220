Description:
 An issue was discovered in the WEBrick toolkit through 1.8.1 for Ruby. It
 allows HTTP request smuggling by providing both a Content-Length header and
 a Transfer-Encoding header, e.g., "GET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\n" inside of a
 "POST /user HTTP/1.1\r\n" request. NOTE: the supplier's position is
 "Webrick should not be used in production."
