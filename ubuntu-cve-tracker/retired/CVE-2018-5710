Description:
 An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. The
 pre-defined function "strlen" is getting a "NULL" string as a parameter
 value in plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principal2.c in the Key
 Distribution Center (KDC), which allows remote authenticated users to cause
 a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a modified kadmin
 client.
