Description:
 Mahara 17.04 before 17.04.8 and 17.10 before 17.10.5 and 18.04 before
 18.04.1 can be used as medium to transmit viruses by placing infected files
 into a Leap2A archive and uploading that to Mahara. In contrast to other
 ZIP files that are uploaded, ClamAV (when activated) does not check Leap2A
 archives for viruses, allowing malicious files to be available for
 download. While files cannot be executed on Mahara itself, Mahara can be
 used to transfer such files to user computers.
