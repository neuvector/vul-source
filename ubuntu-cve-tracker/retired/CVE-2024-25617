Description:
 Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS,
 FTP, and more. Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,Squid may
 be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP header parsing.
 This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial of
 Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions of
 Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or
 reply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default. In Squid
 version 6.5 and later, the default setting of these parameters is safe.
 Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator is
 setting these parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this time
 prevent these settings from being changed to unsafe values. Users are
 advised to upgrade to version 6.5. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as SQUID-2024:2
