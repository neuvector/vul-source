Description:
 In GNU Coreutils through 8.29, chown-core.c in chown and chgrp does not
 prevent replacement of a plain file with a symlink during use of the POSIX
 "-R -L" options, which allows local users to modify the ownership of
 arbitrary files by leveraging a race condition.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> It seems like this will not be fixed upstream (due to the
 ccdm94> nature of the chown and chgrp utilities), the available
 ccdm94> patch being a documentation change to warn users about 
 ccdm94> insecure software behavior when certain options are used
 ccdm94> together in chown and chgrp. For this reason, we will not
 ccdm94> be fixing this issue in releases where it would be needed.
 ccdm94> These will be marked as ignored.
