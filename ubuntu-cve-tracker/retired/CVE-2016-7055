Description:
 There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery
 multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that
 handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis
 suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible.
 This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with
 the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice.
 Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key
 negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key
 operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool
 P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key
 negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for
 attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the
 curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them,
 neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose
 the curve will be affected.
