Description:
 Cleanup errors in some data cache evictions for some Intel(R) Processors
 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information
 disclosure via local access.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that on some Intel processors, data from the most
 recently evicted modified L1 data cache (L1D) line may be propagated
 into an unused (invalid) L1D fill buffer. A local attacker could
 possibly use this to expose sensitive information.
