Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set
 (CRS) through 3.1.0. /rules/REQUEST-933-APPLICATION-ATTACK-PHP.conf allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (ReDOS) by entering a
 specially crafted string with set_error_handler# at the beginning and
 nested repetition operators. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that
 this is a vulnerability because the issue cannot be exploited via
 ModSecurity.
