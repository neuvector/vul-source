Description:
 The canonicalize_username function in svnserve/cyrus_auth.c in Apache
 Subversion before 1.8.16 and 1.9.x before 1.9.4, when Cyrus SASL
 authentication is used, allows remote attackers to authenticate and bypass
 intended access restrictions via a realm string that is a prefix of an
 expected repository realm string.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Daniel Shahaf and James McCoy discovered that Subversion did not
 properly verify realms when using Cyrus SASL authentication. A
 remote attacker could use this to possibly bypass intended access
 restrictions.
