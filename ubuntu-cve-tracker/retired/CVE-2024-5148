Description:
 A flaw was found in the gnome-remote-desktop package. The
 gnome-remote-desktop system daemon performs inadequate validation of
 session agents using D-Bus methods related to transitioning a client
 connection from the login screen to the user session. As a result, the
 system RDP TLS certificate and key can be exposed to unauthorized users.
 This flaw allows a malicious user on the system to take control of the RDP
 client connection during the login screen-to-user session transition.
