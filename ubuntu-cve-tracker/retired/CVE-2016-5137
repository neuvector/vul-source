Description:
 The CSPSource::schemeMatches function in
 WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy
 (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 52.0.2743.82, does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs and does
 not apply ws :80 policies to wss :443 URLs, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been
 visited by reading a CSP report.  NOTE: this vulnerability is associated
 with a specification change after CVE-2016-1617 resolution.
