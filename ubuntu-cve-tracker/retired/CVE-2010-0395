Description:
 OpenOffice.org 2.x and 3.0 before 3.2.1 allows user-assisted remote
 attackers to bypass Python macro security restrictions and execute
 arbitrary Python code via a crafted OpenDocument Text (ODT) file that
 triggers code execution when the macro directory structure is previewed.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Marc Schoenefeld discovered that OpenOffice.org would run document macros
 from the macro browser, even when macros were disabled.  If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted document and examining a macro,
 a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
