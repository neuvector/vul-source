Description:
 A race condition existed in the snapd 2.54.2 snap-confine binary when
 preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. This could allow a local
 attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting their own contents inside
 the snap's private mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute
 arbitrary code and hence gain privilege escalation. Fixed in snapd versions
 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1
