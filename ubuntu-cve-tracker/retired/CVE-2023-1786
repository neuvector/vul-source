Ubuntu-Description:
 James Golovich discovered that sensitive data could be exposed
 in logs. An attacker could use this information to find hashed
 passwords and possibly escalate their privilege.
Notes:
Mitigation:
 The Ubuntu update to address this attempted to redact information
 in /var/log/cloud-init.log and /run/cloud-init/instance-data.json.
 Additional logs may require the removal of sensitive information.
