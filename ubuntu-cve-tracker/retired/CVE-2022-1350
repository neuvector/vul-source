Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 iconstantin> Issue impacts GhostPCL, we currently do not build with
 iconstantin> PCL support.
 mdeslaur> First commit fixes pcl/pcl/pcstatus.c, while this file exists
 mdeslaur> in the focal source package (only), it does not appear to get
 mdeslaur> built as debian/rules contains --without-pcl. The reproducer
 mdeslaur> in the upstream bug needs PCL support to work.
 mdeslaur> The second commit does fix a file that is built in Ubuntu
 mdeslaur> ghostscript packages, but there is no indication that it is
 mdeslaur> security relevant without the PCL support. Marking as "low"
 mdeslaur> for now until further information becomes available.
