Description:
 Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the
 trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS
 hosts. Certifi prior to version 2023.07.22 recognizes "e-Tugra" root
 certificates. e-Tugra's root certificates were subject to an investigation
 prompted by reporting of security issues in their systems. Certifi
 2023.07.22 removes root certificates from "e-Tugra" from the root store.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the python-pip package bundles python-certifi binaries
 mdeslaur> when built. After updating python-certifi, a no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuild of python-pip is required.
 sbeattie> python-certifi in Debian and Ubuntu is patched to use the
   system CA certificates
 mdeslaur> While the cacert.pem file is shipped in binary packages, it is
 mdeslaur> not used in any way, the actual application is patched to
 mdeslaur> use the system ca-certificates. There is a Debian bug filed to
 mdeslaur> remove the cert store here:
 mdeslaur> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=947287
 seth-arnold> I'm marking this 'ignored', we don't wish to give the impression
 seth-arnold> that this certificate bundle is supported.
