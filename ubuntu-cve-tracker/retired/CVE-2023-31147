Description:
 c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When /dev/urandom or
 RtlGenRandom() are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random
 numbers used for DNS query ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also not
 seeded by srand() so will generate predictable output. Input from the
 random number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4 implementation and
 may not be as strong as the original RC4 implementation. No attempt is made
 to look for modern OS-provided CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widely
 available. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1.
