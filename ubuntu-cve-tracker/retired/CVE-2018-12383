Description:
 If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master
 password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This
 is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was
 copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is
 added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored
 password data outside of user expectations. This vulnerability affects
 Firefox < 62, Firefox ESR < 60.2.1, and Thunderbird < 60.2.1.
