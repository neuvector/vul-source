Description:
 During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be
 accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the
 problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by
 treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access. *Note: this
 issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are
 unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 63, Firefox ESR < 60.3,
 and Thunderbird < 60.3.
