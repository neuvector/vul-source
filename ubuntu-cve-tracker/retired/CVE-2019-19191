Description:
 Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) 3.x before 3.1.0 shipped a spec file that
 calls chown on files in a directory controlled by the service user (the
 shibd account) after installation. This allows the user to escalate to root
 by pointing symlinks to files such as /etc/shadow.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> According to Debian:
 ebarretto> This is an issue in the upstream provided spec file which is not
 ebarretto> relevant for the binary packages build in Debian (fixed upstream in
 ebarretto> 3.1.0). The postinst in the Debian packaging does not have similar
 ebarretto> problematic chown logic.
