Description:
 The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp in
 International Components for Unicode (ICU) through 57.1 for C/C++ does not
 ensure that there is a '\0' character at the end of a certain temporary
 array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call
 with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument.
