Description:
 load_cache in GEGL before 0.4.34 allows shell expansion when a pathname in
 a constructed command line is not escaped or filtered. This is caused by
 use of the system library function for execution of the ImageMagick convert
 fallback in magick-load. NOTE: GEGL releases before 0.4.34 are used in GIMP
 releases before 2.10.30; however, this does not imply that GIMP builds
 enable the vulnerable feature.
