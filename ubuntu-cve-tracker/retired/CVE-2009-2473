Description:
 neon before 0.28.6, when expat is used, does not properly detect recursion
 during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause
 a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document
 containing a large number of nested entity references, a similar issue to
 CVE-2003-1564.
