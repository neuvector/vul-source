Description:
 Some administrative paths in Drupal 8.2.x before 8.2.7 did not include
 protection for CSRF. This would allow an attacker to disable some blocks on
 a site. This issue is mitigated by the fact that users would have to know
 the block ID.
Ubuntu-Description:

  this issue is applicable back to drupal7
