Description:
 When a user loaded a Web Extensions context menu, the Web Extension could
 access the post-redirect URL of the element clicked. If the Web Extension
 lacked the WebRequest permission for the hosts involved in the redirect,
 this would be a same-origin-violation leaking data the Web Extension should
 have access to. This was fixed to provide the pre-redirect URL. This is
 related to CVE-2021-43532 but in the context of Web Extensions. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 94.
