 The SSH configuration in the Red Hat mkdumprd script for kexec-tools, as
 distributed in the kexec-tools 1.x before 1.102pre-154 and 2.x before
 2.0.0-209 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, disables the
 StrictHostKeyChecking option, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
 spoof kdump servers, and obtain sensitive core information, by using an
 arbitrary SSH key.
