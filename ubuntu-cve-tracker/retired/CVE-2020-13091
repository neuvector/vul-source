Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** pandas through 1.0.3 can unserialize and execute commands
 from an untrusted file that is passed to the read_pickle() function, if
 __reduce__ makes an os.system call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue
 because the read_pickle() function is documented as unsafe and it is the
 user's responsibility to use the function in a secure manner.
