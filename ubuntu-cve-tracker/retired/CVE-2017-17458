Description:
 In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially malformed
 repository can cause Git subrepositories to run arbitrary code in the form
 of a .git/hooks/post-update script checked into the repository. Typical use
 of Mercurial prevents construction of such repositories, but they can be
 created programmatically.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Mercurial incorrectly handled malformed
 repositories. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
 arbitrary code.
