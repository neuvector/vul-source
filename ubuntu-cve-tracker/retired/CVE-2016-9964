 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-9964
Description:
 redirect() in bottle.py in bottle 0.12.10 doesn't filter a "\r\n" sequence,
 which leads to a CRLF attack, as demonstrated by a
 redirect("233\r\nSet-Cookie: name=salt") call.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that Bottle improperly handles headers. An attacker
 could possibly exploit this as a CRLF attack.
