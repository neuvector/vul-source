Description:
 A path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows. On
 Windows, the filepath.Clean function could transform an invalid path such
 as "a/../c:/b" into the valid path "c:\b". This transformation of a
 relative (if invalid) path into an absolute path could enable a directory
 traversal attack. After fix, the filepath.Clean function transforms this
 path into the relative (but still invalid) path ".\c:\b".

Notes:
 litios> This vulnerability can only be exploited in Windows. 
  Binaries cross-compiled in Ubuntu are affected if they
  are later on used in Windows.
