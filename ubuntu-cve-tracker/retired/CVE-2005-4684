Description:
 Konqueror can associate a cookie with multiple domains when the DNS
 resolver has a non-root domain in its search list, which allows remote
 attackers to trick a user into accepting a cookie for a hostname formed via
 search-list expansion of the hostname entered by the user, or steal a
 cookie for an expanded hostname, as demonstrated by an attacker who
 operates an ap1.com Internet web site to steal cookies associated with an
 ap1.com.example.com intranet web site.
