Description:
 A flaw was found in libssh versions before 0.8.9 and before 0.9.4 in the
 way it handled AES-CTR (or DES ciphers if enabled) ciphers. The server or
 client could crash when the connection hasn't been fully initialized and
 the system tries to cleanup the ciphers when closing the connection. The
 biggest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.
