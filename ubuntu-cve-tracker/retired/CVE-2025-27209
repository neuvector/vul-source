Description:
 The V8 release used in Node.js v24.0.0 has changed how string hashes are
 computed using rapidhash. This implementation re-introduces the HashDoS
 vulnerability as an attacker who can control the strings to be hashed can
 generate many hash collisions - an attacker can generate collisions even
 without knowing the hash-seed.
 
 * This vulnerability affects Node.js v24.x users.
