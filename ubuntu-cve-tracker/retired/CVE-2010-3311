Description:
 Integer overflow in base/ftstream.c in libXft (aka the X FreeType library)
 in FreeType before 2.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
 Compact Font Format (CFF) font file that triggers a heap-based buffer
 overflow, related to an "input stream position error" issue, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2010-1797.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> although provided patch is for freetype, the heap overflow is in
 mdeslaur> libxft/xft.
