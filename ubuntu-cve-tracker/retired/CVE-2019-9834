Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The Netdata web application through 1.13.0 allows remote
 attackers to inject their own malicious HTML code into an imported
 snapshot, aka HTML Injection. Successful exploitation will allow
 attacker-supplied HTML to run in the context of the affected browser,
 potentially allowing the attacker to steal authentication credentials or to
 control how the site is rendered to the user. NOTE: the vendor disputes the
 risk because there is a clear warning next to the button for importing a
 snapshot.
