Description:
 The blowfish mode in DAR before 2.3.4 uses weak Blowfish-CBC cryptography
 by (1) discarding random bits by the blowfish::make_ivec function in
 libdar/crypto.cpp that results in predictable and repeating IV values, and
 (2) direct use of a password for keying, which makes it easier for
 context-dependent attackers to decrypt files.
