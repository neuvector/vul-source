Description:
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
 information on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not
 required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
 getdirparams method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
 of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an
 allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other
 vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was
 ZDI-CAN-15830.
