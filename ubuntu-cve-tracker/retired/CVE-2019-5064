Description:
 An exploitable heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the data
 structure persistence functionality of OpenCV, before version 4.2.0. A
 specially crafted JSON file can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in
 multiple heap corruptions and potentially code execution. An attacker can
 provide a specially crafted file to trigger this vulnerability.
