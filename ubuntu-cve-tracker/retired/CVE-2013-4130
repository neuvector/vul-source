Description:
 The (1) red_channel_pipes_add_type and (2) red_channel_pipes_add_empty_msg
 functions in server/red_channel.c in SPICE before 0.12.4 do not properly
 perform ring loops, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (reachable assertion and server exit) by triggering a network
 error.
