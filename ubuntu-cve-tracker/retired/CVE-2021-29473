Description:
 Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete
 and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds read
 was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line
 utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the
 metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is
 used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could
 potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by
 crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a
 crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the
 metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the
 metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line
 application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as
 `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Please see our security
 policy for information about Exiv2 security.
