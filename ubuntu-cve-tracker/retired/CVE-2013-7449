Description:
 The ssl_do_connect function in common/server.c in HexChat before 2.10.2,
 XChat, and XChat-GNOME does not verify that the server hostname matches a
 domain name in the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
