Description:
 The try_read_command function in memcached.c in memcached before 1.4.39
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)
 via a request to add/set a key, which makes a comparison between signed and
 unsigned int and triggers a heap-based buffer over-read. NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8705.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Daniel Shapira discovered an integer overflow issue in Memcached. A
 remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (daemon
 crash).
