Description:
 Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality in
 PHP 5.3.17, when installed in the top-level C:\ directory, might allow
 local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\PHP
 directory, which may be added to the PATH system environment variable by an
 administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by
 the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista
 SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.
  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the unsafe PATH is established only
 by a separate administrative action that is not a default part of the PHP
 installation
