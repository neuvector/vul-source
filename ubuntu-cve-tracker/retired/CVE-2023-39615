Description:
 Xmlsoft Libxml2 v2.11.0 was discovered to contain an out-of-bounds read via
 the xmlSAX2StartElement() function at /libxml2/SAX2.c. This vulnerability
 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted
 XML file. NOTE: the vendor's position is that the product does not support
 the legacy SAX1 interface with custom callbacks; there is a crash even
 without crafted input.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> as explained by upstream in issue #535, this is not considered a
 ccdm94> security issue, but, instead, a mode of operation that was not
 ccdm94> working properly, regardless of the input provided. It is also
 ccdm94> not possible to reproduce the issue in versions older than
 ccdm94> 2.11.0, meaning, no Ubuntu releases as of 2022-11-21 would
 ccdm94> allow this, the provided PoC not being able to generate the crash
 ccdm94> on these releases.
