Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Xmlsoft Libxml2 v2.11.0 was discovered to contain an
 out-of-bounds read via the xmlSAX2StartElement() function at
 /libxml2/SAX2.c. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of
 Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted XML file. NOTE: the vendor's position
 is that the product does not support the legacy SAX1 interface with custom
 callbacks; there is a crash even without crafted input.

Notes:
 ccdm94> as explained by upstream in issue #535, this is not considered a
 ccdm94> security issue, but, instead, a mode of operation that was not
 ccdm94> working properly, regardless of the input provided. It is also
 ccdm94> not possible to reproduce the issue in versions older than
 ccdm94> 2.11.0, meaning, no Ubuntu releases as of 2022-11-21 would
 ccdm94> allow this, the provided PoC not being able to generate the crash
 ccdm94> on these releases.
