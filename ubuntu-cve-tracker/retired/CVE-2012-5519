Description:
 CUPS 1.4.4, when running in certain Linux distributions such as Debian
 GNU/Linux, stores the web interface administrator key in
 /var/run/cups/certs/0 using certain permissions, which allows local users
 in the lpadmin group to read or write arbitrary files as root by leveraging
 the web interface.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On Ubuntu, file disclosure and corruption is limited by the
 mdeslaur> AppArmor profile, which limits exposure. It still can access
 mdeslaur> some important files though, such as /etc/shadow.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Upstream patch moves dangerous configuration options to a
 mdeslaur> second config file which is not web-editable. Although this is
 mdeslaur> a good long-term solution, the changes are too intrusive for a
 mdeslaur> security update. The most sensible thing to do at this time is
 mdeslaur> to completely disable modifying the cupsd.conf file via the web
 mdeslaur> interface.
