Description:
 An Authentication Bypass vulnerability existed where the application
 bundled an interpreter (Python) that inherits the Transparency, Consent,
 and Control (TCC) permissions granted by the user to the main application
 bundle
 
 
 
 
 By executing the bundled interpreter directly the attacker's scripts run
 with the application's TCC privileges
 
 
 
 
 In fixed versions parent-constraints are used to allow only the main
 application to launch interpreter with those permissions
 
 This issue affects LibreOffice on macOS: from 25.2 before < 25.2.4.
