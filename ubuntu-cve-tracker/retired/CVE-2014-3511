Description:
 The ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before
 1.0.1i allows man-in-the-middle attackers to force the use of TLS 1.0 by
 triggering ClientHello message fragmentation in communication between a
 client and server that both support later TLS versions, related to a
 "protocol downgrade" issue.
