Description:
 A flaw was found in the libssh library in versions less than 0.11.2. An
 out-of-bounds read can be triggered in the sftp_handle function due to an
 incorrect comparison check that permits the function to access memory
 beyond the valid handle list and to return an invalid pointer, which is
 used in further processing. This vulnerability allows an authenticated
 remote attacker to potentially read unintended memory regions, exposing
 sensitive information or affect service behavior.
