Description:
 Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the
 trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS
 hosts. Certifi 2022.12.07 removes root certificates from "TrustCor" from
 the root store. These are in the process of being removed from Mozilla's
 trust store. TrustCor's root certificates are being removed pursuant to an
 investigation prompted by media reporting that TrustCor's ownership also
 operated a business that produced spyware. Conclusions of Mozilla's
 investigation can be found in the linked google group discussion.
