Description:
 Screen 5.0.0 when it runs with setuid-root privileges does not drop
 privileges while operating on a user supplied path. This allows
 unprivileged users to create files in arbitrary locations with `root`
 ownership, the invoking user's (real) group ownership and file mode 0644.
 All data written to the Screen PTY will be logged into this file, allowing
 to escalate to root privileges
