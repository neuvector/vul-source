Description:
 libcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if
 thehost name is provided with a trailing dot.curl can be told to receive
 and send cookies. curl's "cookie engine" can bebuilt with or without
 [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/)awareness. If PSL support
 not provided, a more rudimentary check exists to atleast prevent cookies
 from being set on TLDs. This check was broken if thehost name in the URL
 uses a trailing dot.This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then
 would get sent to adifferent and unrelated site or domain.
