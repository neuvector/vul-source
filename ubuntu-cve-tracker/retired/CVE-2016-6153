Description:
 os_unix.c in SQLite before 3.13.0 improperly implements the temporary
 directory search algorithm, which might allow local users to obtain
 sensitive information, cause a denial of service (application crash), or
 have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of the current working
 directory for temporary files.
