Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. There is a missing unlock in the
 XENMEM_acquire_resource error path. The RCU (Read, Copy, Update) mechanism
 is a synchronisation primitive. A buggy error path in the
 XENMEM_acquire_resource exits without releasing an RCU reference, which is
 conceptually similar to forgetting to unlock a spinlock. A buggy or
 malicious HVM stubdomain can cause an RCU reference to be leaked. This
 causes subsequent administration operations, (e.g., CPU offline) to
 livelock, resulting in a host Denial of Service. The buggy codepath has
 been present since Xen 4.12. Xen 4.14 and later are vulnerable to the DoS.
 The side effects are believed to be benign on Xen 4.12 and 4.13, but
 patches are provided nevertheless. The vulnerability can generally only be
 exploited by x86 HVM VMs, as these are generally the only type of VM that
 have a Qemu stubdomain. x86 PV and PVH domains, as well as ARM VMs,
 typically don't use a stubdomain. Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can
 exploit the vulnerability. VMs using PV stubdomains, or with emulators
 running in dom0, cannot exploit the vulnerability.
