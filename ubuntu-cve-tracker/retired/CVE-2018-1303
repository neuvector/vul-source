Description:
 A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP
 Server prior to version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read while preparing
 data to be cached in shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service
 attack against users of mod_cache_socache. The vulnerability is considered
 as low risk since mod_cache_socache is not widely used, mod_cache_disk is
 not concerned by this vulnerability.
