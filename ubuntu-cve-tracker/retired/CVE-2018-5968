Description:
 FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.11 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows
 unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the
 CVE-2017-7525 and CVE-2017-17485 deserialization flaws. This is exploitable
 via two different gadgets that bypass a blacklist.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled
 deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
 arbitrary code.
