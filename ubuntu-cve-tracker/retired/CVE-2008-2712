Description:
 Vim 7.1.314, 6.4, and other versions allows user-assisted remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary commands via Vim scripts that do not properly sanitize
 inputs before invoking the execute or system functions, as demonstrated
 using (1) filetype.vim, (3) xpm.vim, (4) gzip_vim, and (5) netrw.  NOTE:
 the originally reported version was 7.1.314, but the researcher actually
 found this set of issues in 7.1.298.  NOTE: the zipplugin issue (originally
 vector 2 in this identifier) has been subsumed by CVE-2008-3075.
