Description:
 In curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it into
 staying with HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use
 HTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP step) even when
 HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the host
 name in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII
 counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, e.g., using the character UTF-8
 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop of
 U+002E (.). The earliest affected version is 7.77.0 2021-05-26.
