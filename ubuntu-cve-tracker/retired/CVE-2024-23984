Description:
 Observable discrepancy in RAPL interface for some Intel(R) Processors may
 allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via
 local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly restrict
 access to the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface. This may allow
 a local privileged attacker to obtain sensitive information.
