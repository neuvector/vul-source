Description:
 Python before 2.6.8, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, 3.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before
 3.2.3 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash
 collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
 denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application
 that maintains a hash table.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> patch does not change the default, so the risk of backporting to
  python2.5 and python2.4 outweighs the benefit of adding the patch. Ubuntu
  8.04 LTS who require this patch should upgrade to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or
  another supported release.
 jdstrand> the patch for 3.2 on oneiric is somewhere between the upstream 3.1
  and 3.2 patches. Specifically, need the Modules/_datetimemodule.c changes
