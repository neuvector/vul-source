Description:
 A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the
 function that allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem.
 This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker to unmount FUSE filesystems
 that belong to certain other users who have a UID that is a prefix of the
 UID of the attacker in its string form. An attacker may use this flaw to
 cause a denial of service to applications that use the affected
 filesystems.
