Description:
 Under certain circumstances the "fetch()" API can return transient local
 copies of resources that were sent with a "no-store" or "no-cache" cache
 header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This
 can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being
 accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Firefox < 59.
