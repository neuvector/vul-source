Description:
 A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A
 flawed bounds checking in the copy_data function leads to a buffer overflow
 allowing an attacker in a virtual machine to write arbitrary data to any
 address in the vhost_crypto application. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
 availability.
