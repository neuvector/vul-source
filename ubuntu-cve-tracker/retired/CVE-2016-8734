Description:
 Apache Subversion's mod_dontdothat module and HTTP clients 1.4.0 through
 1.8.16, and 1.9.0 through 1.9.4 are vulnerable to a denial-of-service
 attack caused by exponential XML entity expansion. The attack can cause the
 targeted process to consume an excessive amount of CPU resources or memory.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Florian Weimer discovered that Subversion clients did not properly
 restrict XML entity expansion when accessing http(s):// URLs. A remote
 attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> for mod_dontdothat, we don't ship it in binary packages
 mdeslaur> for clients, we build with serf, so we're vulnerable
