Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the tiffsplit command in libtiff 3.8.2 and
 earlier might might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
 filename.  NOTE: tiffsplit is not setuid.  If there is not a common
 scenario under which tiffsplit is called with attacker-controlled command
 line arguments, then perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
