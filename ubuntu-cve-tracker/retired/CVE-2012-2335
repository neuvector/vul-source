Description:
 php-wrapper.fcgi does not properly handle command-line arguments, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass a protection mechanism in PHP 5.3.12 and
 5.4.2 and execute arbitrary code by leveraging improper interaction between
 the PHP sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c component and a query string beginning with a
 +- sequence.
