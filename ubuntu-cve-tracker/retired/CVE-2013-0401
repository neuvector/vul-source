Description:
 The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 17
 and earlier, 6 Update 43 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 41 and earlier; and
 OpenJDK 6 and 7; allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 vectors related to AWT, as demonstrated by Ben Murphy during a Pwn2Own
 competition at CanSecWest 2013.  NOTE: the previous information is from the
 April 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that
 this issue is related to invocation of the system class loader by the
 sun.awt.datatransfer.ClassLoaderObjectInputStream class, which allows
 remote attackers to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
