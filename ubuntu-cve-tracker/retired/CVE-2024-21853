Description:
 Improper finite state machines (FSMs) in the hardware logic in some 4th and
 5th Generation Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to
 potentially enable denial of service via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that some 4th and 5th Generation Intel(R) Xeon(R)
 Processors did not properly implement finite state machines (FSMs) in
 hardware logic. THis may allow a local privileged attacker to cause a
 denial of service (system crash).
