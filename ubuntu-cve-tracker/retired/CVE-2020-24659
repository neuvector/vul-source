Description:
 An issue was discovered in GnuTLS before 3.6.15. A server can trigger a
 NULL pointer dereference in a TLS 1.3 client if a no_renegotiation alert is
 sent with unexpected timing, and then an invalid second handshake occurs.
 The crash happens in the application's error handling path, where the
 gnutls_deinit function is called after detecting a handshake failure.
