Description:
 A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by
 OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within
 a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously.
 However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not
 async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful
 attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a
 remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd
 server.
