Description:
 The Live DVD for Edubuntu 9.10, 10.04 LTS, and 10.10 does not correctly
 regenerate iTALC private keys after installation, which causes each
 installation to have the same fixed key, which allows remote attackers to
 gain privileges.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Stéphane Graber discovered that the iTALC private keys shipped with the
 Edubuntu Live media were not correctly regenerated once Edubuntu was
 installed. If an iTALC client was installed with the vulnerable keys,
 a remote attacker could gain control of the system.
