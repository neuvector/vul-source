Description:
 The import_request_variables function in PHP 4.0.7 through 4.4.6, and 5.x
 before 5.2.2, when called without a prefix, does not prevent the (1) GET,
 (2) POST, (3) COOKIE, (4) FILES, (5) SERVER, (6) SESSION, and other
 superglobals from being overwritten, which allows remote attackers to spoof
 source IP address and Referer data, and have other unspecified impact. 
 NOTE: it could be argued that this is a design limitation of PHP and that
 only the misuse of this feature, i.e. implementation bugs in applications,
 should be included in CVE. However, it has been fixed by the vendor.
