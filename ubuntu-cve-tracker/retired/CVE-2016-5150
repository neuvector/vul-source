Description:
 WebKit/Source/bindings/modules/v8/V8BindingForModules.cpp in Blink, as used
 in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before
 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, has an Indexed Database (aka IndexedDB) API
 implementation that does not properly restrict key-path evaluation, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that
 leverages certain side effects.
