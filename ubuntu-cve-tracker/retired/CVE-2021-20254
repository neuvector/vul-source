Description:
 A flaw was found in samba. The Samba smbd file server must map Windows
 group identities (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The code that performs
 this had a flaw that could allow it to read data beyond the end of the
 array in the case where a negative cache entry had been added to the
 mapping cache. This could cause the calling code to return those values
 into the process token that stores the group membership for a user. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and
 integrity.
