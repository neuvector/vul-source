Description:
 Virt-install(1) utility used to provision new virtual machines has
 introduced an option '--unattended' to create VMs without user interaction.
 This option accepts guest VM password as command line arguments, thus
 leaking them to others users on the system via process listing. It was
 introduced recently in the virt-manager v2.2.0 release.
