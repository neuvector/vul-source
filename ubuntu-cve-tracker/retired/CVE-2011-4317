Description:
 The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x
 through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the Revision 1179239 patch
 is in place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2)
 ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which
 allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a
 malformed URI containing an @ (at sign) character and a : (colon) character
 in invalid positions.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.
