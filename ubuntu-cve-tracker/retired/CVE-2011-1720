Description:
 The SMTP server in Postfix before 2.5.13, 2.6.x before 2.6.10, 2.7.x before
 2.7.4, and 2.8.x before 2.8.3, when certain Cyrus SASL authentication
 methods are enabled, does not create a new server handle after client
 authentication fails, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (heap memory corruption and daemon crash) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via an invalid AUTH command with one method followed by an
 AUTH command with a different method.
