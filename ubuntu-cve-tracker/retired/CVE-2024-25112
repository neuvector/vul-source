Description:
 Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
 deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A denial-of-service
 was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1: an unbounded recursion can cause Exiv2
 to crash by exhausting the stack. The vulnerable function,
 `QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2
 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The denial-of-service is
 triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file.
 This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There
 are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
