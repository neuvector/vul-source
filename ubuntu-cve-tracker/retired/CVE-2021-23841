Description:
 The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to
 create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data
 contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle
 any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur
 if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently
 result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of
 service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never
 directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if
 they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may
 have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and
 below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
 OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this
 issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving
 public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade
 to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j
 (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).
