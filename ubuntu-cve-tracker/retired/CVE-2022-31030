Description:
 containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the
 containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause
 the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of
 the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available
 memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads.
 Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI
 implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when
 executing processes via an "exec" facility. This bug has been fixed in
 containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to
 resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted
 images and commands are used.
