Description:
 In GPAC 0.7.1 and earlier, gf_text_get_utf8_line in
 media_tools/text_import.c in libgpac_static.a allows an out-of-bounds write
 because a certain -1 return value is mishandled.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain
 memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a
 specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause
 MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute
 arbitrary code.
