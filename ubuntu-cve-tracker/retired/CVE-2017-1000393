Description:
 Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier users with permission to
 create or configure agents in Jenkins could configure a launch method
 called 'Launch agent via execution of command on master'. This allowed them
 to run arbitrary shell commands on the master node whenever the agent was
 supposed to be launched. Configuration of this launch method now requires
 the Run Scripts permission typically only granted to administrators.
