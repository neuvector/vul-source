Description:
 The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly restrict
 the lifetime of queue entries associated with unused out-of-order messages,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption) by maintaining many crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously,
 related to d1_lib.c, statem_dtls.c, statem_lib.c, and statem_srvr.c.
