Description:
 The WebRTC subsystem in Mozilla Firefox before 36.0 recognizes turns: and
 stuns: URIs but accesses the TURN or STUN server without using TLS, which
 makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to discover credentials by
 spoofing a server and completing a brute-force attack within a short time
 window.
