Description:
 If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right
 alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to
 spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being

 different site than the one loaded. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
 < 52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.
