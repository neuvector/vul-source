Description:
 MySQL 5.5.19 and possibly other versions, and MariaDB 5.5.28a and possibly
 other versions, when configured to assign the FILE privilege to users who
 should not have administrative privileges, allows remote authenticated
 users to gain privileges by leveraging the FILE privilege to create files
 as the MySQL administrator. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating
 that this is only a vulnerability when the administrator does not follow
 recommendations in the product's installation documentation. NOTE: it could
 be argued that this should not be included in CVE because it is a
 configuration issue.
