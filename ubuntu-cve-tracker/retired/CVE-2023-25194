Description:
 A possible security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka
 Connect API.
 This requires access to a Kafka Connect worker, and the ability to
 create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka client SASL JAAS
 config
 and a SASL-based security protocol, which has been possible on Kafka
 Connect clusters since Apache Kafka Connect 2.3.0.
 When configuring the connector via the Kafka Connect REST API,
 an authenticated operator can set the `sasl.jaas.config`
 property for any of the connector's Kafka clients to
 "com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule", which can be done via the
 `producer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, `consumer.override.sasl.jaas.config`,
 or `admin.override.sasl.jaas.config` properties.
 This will allow the server to connect to the attacker's LDAP server
 and deserialize the LDAP response, which the attacker can use to execute
 java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server.
 Attacker can cause unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data (or) RCE
 vulnerability when there are gadgets in the classpath.
 
 Since Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users are allowed to specify these properties in
 connector configurations for Kafka Connect clusters running with
 out-of-the-box
 configurations. Before Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users may not specify these
 properties unless the Kafka Connect cluster has been reconfigured with a
 connector
 client override policy that permits them.
 
 Since Apache Kafka 3.4.0, we have added a system property
 ("-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules") to disable the problematic
 login modules usage
 in SASL JAAS configuration. Also by default
 "com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule" is disabled in Apache Kafka
 Connect 3.4.0.
 
 We advise the Kafka Connect users to validate connector configurations and
 only allow trusted JNDI configurations. Also examine connector dependencies
 for
 vulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that
 specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation.
 Finally,
 in addition to leveraging the "org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules"
 system property, Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector
 client config override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka
 client properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and
 which cannot.
