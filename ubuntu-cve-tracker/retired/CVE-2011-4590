Description:
 The web services implementation in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.6 and 2.1.x
 before 2.1.3 does not properly consider the maintenance-mode state and
 account attributes during login attempts, which allows remote authenticated
 users to bypass intended access restrictions by connecting to a webservice
 server.
