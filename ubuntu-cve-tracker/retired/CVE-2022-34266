Description:
 The libtiff-4.0.3-35.amzn2.0.1 package for LibTIFF on Amazon Linux 2 allows
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash), a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2022-0562. When processing a malicious TIFF file, an
 invalid range may be passed as an argument to the memset() function within
 TIFFFetchStripThing() in tif_dirread.c. This will cause
 TIFFFetchStripThing() to segfault after use of an uninitialized resource.
