Description:
 XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 XStream before version 1.4.15, is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion
 on the local host when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote
 attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing
 process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input
 stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security
 Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported
 vulnerability does not exist running Java 15 or higher. No user is
 affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security
 Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist
 can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the
 vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use
 XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed
 in the referenced advisories.
