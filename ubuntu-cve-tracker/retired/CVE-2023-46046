Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue in MiniZinc before 2.8.0 allows a NULL pointer
 dereference via ti_expr in a crafted .mzn file. NOTE: this is disputed
 because there is no common libminizinc use case in which an unattended
 process is supposed to run forever to process a series of
 atttacker-controlled .mzn files.
