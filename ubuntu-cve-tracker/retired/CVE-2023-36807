Description:
 pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping,
 and transforming the pages of PDF files. In version 2.10.5 an attacker who 
 uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop.
 This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core
 of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example,
 the case if the user extracted metadata from such a malformed PDF. Versions
 prior to 2.10.5 throw an error, but do not hang forever. This issue was 
 fixed with https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1331 which has been
 included in release 2.10.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
 upgrade should modify `PyPDF2/generic/_data_structures.py::read_object` to
 an an error throwing case. See GHSA-hm9v-vj3r-r55m for details.
