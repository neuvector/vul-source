Description:
 Zsh before version 5.4.2-test-1 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the
 shell autocomplete functionality. A local unprivileged user can create a
 specially crafted directory path which leads to code execution in the
 context of the user who tries to use autocomplete to traverse the before
 mentioned path. If the user affected is privileged, this leads to privilege
 escalation.
