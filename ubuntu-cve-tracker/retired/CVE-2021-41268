Description:
 Symfony/SecurityBundle is the security system for Symfony, a PHP framework
 for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components.
 Since the rework of the Remember me cookie in version 5.3.0, the cookie is
 not invalidated when the user changes their password. Attackers can
 therefore maintain their access to the account even if the password is
 changed as long as they have had the chance to login once and get a valid
 remember me cookie. Starting with version 5.3.12, Symfony makes the
 password part of the signature by default. In that way, when the password
 changes, then the cookie is not valid anymore.
