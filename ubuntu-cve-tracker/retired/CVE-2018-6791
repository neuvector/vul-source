Description:
 An issue was discovered in soliduiserver/deviceserviceaction.cpp in KDE
 Plasma Workspace before 5.12.0. When a vfat thumbdrive that contains `` or
 $() in its volume label is plugged in and mounted through the device
 notifier, it's interpreted as a shell command, leading to a possibility of
 arbitrary command execution. An example of an offending volume label is
 "$(touch b)" -- this will create a file called b in the home folder.
