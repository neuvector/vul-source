Description:
 libspf2 before 1.2.11 has a heap-based buffer overflow that might allow
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (via an unauthenticated e-mail
 message from anywhere on the Internet) with a crafted SPF DNS record,
 because of SPF_record_expand_data in spf_expand.c. The amount of overflowed
 data depends on the relationship between the length of an entire domain
 name and the length of its leftmost label. The vulnerable code may be part
 of the supply chain of a site's e-mail infrastructure (e.g., with
 additional configuration, Exim can use libspf2; the Postfix web site links
 to unofficial patches for use of libspf2 with Postfix; older versions of
 spfquery relied on libspf2) but most often is not.
