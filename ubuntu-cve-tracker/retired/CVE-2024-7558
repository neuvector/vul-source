Description:
 JUJU_CONTEXT_ID is a predictable authentication secret. On a Juju machine
 (non-Kubernetes) or Juju charm container (on Kubernetes), an unprivileged
 user in the same network namespace can connect to an abstract domain socket
 and guess the JUJU_CONTEXT_ID value. This gives the unprivileged user
 access to the same information and tools as the Juju charm.
