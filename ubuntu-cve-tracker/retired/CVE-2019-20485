Description:
 qemu/qemu_driver.c in libvirt before 6.0.0 mishandles the holding of a
 monitor job during a query to a guest agent, which allows attackers to
 cause a denial of service (API blockage).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> it appears this CVE is only for the suspend job because it is
 mdeslaur> the only one that doesn't require write permissions.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> In libvirt in bionic and older, there was no support for running
 mdeslaur> both agent monitor jobs and normal monitor jobs at the same.
 mdeslaur> Support for doing so was introduced in the following commit:
 mdeslaur> https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commit/4621350f6d3dbca57bbd97829ff5d4efc3a51c97
 mdeslaur> As such, it would not appear that a malicious guest agent would
 mdeslaur> be able to block jobs in bionic and earlier, so marking as
 mdeslaur> not-affected.
