Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso
 through 0.4.0 handles grammar parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies
 on pickle and, provided that an evil pickle can be written to a cache
 grammar file and that its parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads to
 Arbitrary Code Execution. NOTE: This is disputed because "the cache
 directory is not under control of the attacker in any common
 configuration."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> not considered a vulnerability by upstream, and no fix
 ccdm94> available as of 2022-10-18. A documentation change was
 ccdm94> made in order to warn users that the cache uses pickle
 ccdm94> files (see commit 19de3eb) and a PR (#79) was opened to
 ccdm94> replace pickle, but this was closed without any actual
 ccdm94> changes being made.
