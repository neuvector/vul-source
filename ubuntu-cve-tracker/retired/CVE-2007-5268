Description:
 pngrtran.c in libpng before 1.0.29 and 1.2.x before 1.2.21 use (1) logical
 instead of bitwise operations and (2) incorrect comparisons, which might
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted
 PNG image.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> given medium because of wide install base
 jdstrand> bug (1) is said to have been introduced in 1.2.19.  Looking at
   pngrtran.c in 1.2.8 and 1.2.15 (as included in Ubuntu), the vulnerable code
   is not present
 jdstrand> bug (2) still applies to 1.2.15, but not 1.2.8
 jdstrand> reducing to negligible as pngset.c change should not do anything
