Description:
 A flaw was discovered in ibus in versions before 1.5.22 that allows any
 unprivileged user to monitor and send method calls to the ibus bus of
 another user due to a misconfiguration in the DBus server setup. A local
 attacker may use this flaw to intercept all keystrokes of a victim user who
 is using the graphical interface, change the input method engine, or modify
 other input related configurations of the victim user.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Simon McVittie discovered that ibus did not enforce appropriate access
 controls on its private D-Bus socket. A local unprivileged user who
 discovers the ibus socket address of another user could exploit this to
 capture the key strokes of the other user.
Notes:
 alexmurray> The ibus D-Bus socket address contains a long random guid making
  discovery of this address by another user unlikely.
 mdeslaur> this was reverted in 4134-2 because of a regression, see LP bug
