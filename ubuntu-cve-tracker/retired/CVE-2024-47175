Description:
 CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libppd` can be
 used for legacy PPD file support. The `libppd` function
 `ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2` does not sanitize IPP attributes when creating the
 PPD buffer. When used in combination with other functions such as
 `cfGetPrinterAttributes5`, can result in user controlled input and
 ultimately code execution via Foomatic. This vulnerability can be part of
 an exploit chain leading to remote code execution (RCE), as described in
 CVE-2024-47176.
