Description:
 A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in
 a HTTP response to curl and curl < 7.84.0 stores all of them. A
 sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make subsequent HTTP requests to
 this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests that
 become larger than the threshold that curl uses internally to avoid sending
 crazy large requests (1048576 bytes) and instead returns an error.This
 denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match
 and haven't expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on
 `foo.example.com` can set cookies that also would match for
 `bar.example.com`, making it it possible for a "sister server" to
 effectively cause a denial of service for a sibling site on the same second
 level domain using this method.
