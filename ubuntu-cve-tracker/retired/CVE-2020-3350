Description:
 A vulnerability in the endpoint software of Cisco AMP for Endpoints and
 Clam AntiVirus could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause the
 running software to delete arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability
 is due to a race condition that could occur when scanning malicious files.
 An attacker with local shell access could exploit this vulnerability by
 executing a script that could trigger the race condition. A successful
 exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files on the system
 that the attacker would not normally have privileges to delete, producing
 system instability or causing the endpoint software to stop working.
