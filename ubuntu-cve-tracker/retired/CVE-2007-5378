Description:
 Buffer overflow in the FileReadGIF function in tkImgGIF.c for Tk Toolkit
 8.4.12 and earlier, and 8.3.5 and earlier, allows user-assisted attackers
 to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via an animated GIF in
 which the first subimage is smaller than a subsequent subimage, which
 triggers the overflow in the ReadImage function, a different vulnerability
 than CVE-2007-5137.
Ubuntu-Description:
 USN-529-1
 It was discovered that Tk could be made to overrun a buffer when loading
 certain images. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted GIF
 image, remote attackers could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary
 code with user privileges.
