Description:
 nss_ldap 181 to versions before 213, as used in Mandrake Corporate Server
 and Mandrake 10.0, and other operating systems, does not properly handle a
 SIGPIPE signal when sending a search request to an LDAP directory server,
 which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crond and
 other application crash) if they can cause an LDAP server to become
 unavailable.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this attack scenario is
 sufficient to include this item in CVE.
