Description:
 WebKit in Apple Safari before 4.0, iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.2.1, and iPhone
 OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1 does not properly handle constant (aka
 const) declarations in a type-conversion operation during JavaScript
 exception handling, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
 or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via
 a crafted HTML document.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from
  it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit
 mdeslaur> code doesn't seem present in kde4libs
 mdeslaur> code not present in webkit in intrepid+
 mdeslaur> code is different in hardy, need to check with test case
 mdeslaur> in qt4-x11, code doesn't seem present
