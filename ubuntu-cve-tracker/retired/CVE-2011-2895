Description:
 The LZW decompressor in (1) the BufCompressedFill function in
 fontfile/decompress.c in X.Org libXfont before 1.4.4 and (2)
 compress/compress.c in 4.3BSD, as used in zopen.c in OpenBSD before 3.8,
 FreeBSD, NetBSD 4.0.x and 5.0.x before 5.0.3 and 5.1.x before 5.1.1,
 FreeType 2.1.9, and other products, does not properly handle code words
 that are absent from the decompression table when encountered, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to trigger an infinite loop or a heap-based
 buffer overflow, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via a crafted
 compressed stream, a related issue to CVE-2006-1168 and CVE-2011-2896.
