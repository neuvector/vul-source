Description:
 Google Chrome before 25.0.1364.152 does not properly manage the interaction
 between the browser process and renderer processes during authorization of
 the loading of a plug-in, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
 bypass intended access restrictions via vectors involving a blocked
 plug-in.
