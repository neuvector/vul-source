Description:
 Adobe Flash Player before 10.2.154.27 on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and
 Solaris and 10.2.156.12 and earlier on Android; Adobe AIR before 2.6.19140;
 and Authplay.dll (aka AuthPlayLib.bundle) in Adobe Reader 9.x before 9.4.4
 and 10.x through 10.0.1 on Windows, Adobe Reader 9.x before 9.4.4 and 10.x
 before 10.0.3 on Mac OS X, and Adobe Acrobat 9.x before 9.4.4 and 10.x
 before 10.0.3 on Windows and Mac OS X allow remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted
 Flash content; as demonstrated by a Microsoft Office document with an
 embedded .swf file that has a size inconsistency in a "group of included
 constants," object type confusion, ActionScript that adds custom functions
 to prototypes, and Date objects; and as exploited in the wild in April
 2011.
