Description:
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI
 specification. In affected versions it was found that rootless runc makes
 `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when runc is executed
 inside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does not specify the
 cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run
 --cgroupns=host`, with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc is
 executed outside the user namespace, and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro`
 (e.g., `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare). A container
 may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy
 `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other users's cgroup
 hierarchies are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version
 1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace
 (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default
 behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts. or add
 `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`.
