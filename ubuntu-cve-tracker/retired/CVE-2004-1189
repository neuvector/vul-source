Description:
 The add_to_history function in svr_principal.c in libkadm5srv for MIT
 Kerberos 5 (krb5) up to 1.3.5, when performing a password change, does not
 properly track the password policy's history count and the maximum number
 of keys, which can cause an array index out-of-bounds error and may allow
 authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a heap-based buffer
 overflow.
