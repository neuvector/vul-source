Description:
 The hack-local-variables function in Emacs before 22.2, when
 enable-local-variables is set to :safe, does not properly search lists of
 unsafe or risky variables, which might allow user-assisted attackers to
 bypass intended restrictions and modify critical program variables via a
 file containing a Local variables declaration.
