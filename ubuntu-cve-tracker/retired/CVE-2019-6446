Description:
 ** DISPUTED **   An issue was discovered in NumPy 1.16.0 and earlier. It
 uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by
 a numpy.load call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is  a
 behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example)  loading
 serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated  sources.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> The following commit added an option that will allow disabling
 mdeslaur> the use of pickles in load and save operations:
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/numpy/numpy/commit/a2bd3a7eabfe053d6d16a2130fdcad9e5211f6bb
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> That commit is included in xenial+
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Marking this as low priority due to the limited reverse-depends
 mdeslaur> in main, and the fact that it may not be possible to switch the
 mdeslaur> default to false in stable releases without breaking use-cases.
