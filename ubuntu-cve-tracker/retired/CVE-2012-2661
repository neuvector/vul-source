Description:
 The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x
 before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly implement the
 passing of request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which
 allows remote attackers to conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested
 query parameters that leverage unintended recursion, a related issue to
 CVE-2012-2695.
