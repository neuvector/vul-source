Description:
 containerd is an open source container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. A bug was found in containerd where
 container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restricted
 permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse
 directory contents and execute programs. When containers included
 executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid),
 unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When
 the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file
 owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host
 could discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has been
 fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to
 these version when they are released and may restart containers or update
 directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to update
 should limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory
 permission on container bundles directories.
