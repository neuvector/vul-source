Description:
 In ISC BIND9 versions BIND 9.11.14 -> 9.11.19, BIND 9.14.9 -> 9.14.12, BIND
 9.16.0 -> 9.16.3, BIND Supported Preview Edition 9.11.14-S1 -> 9.11.19-S1:
 Unless a nameserver is providing authoritative service for one or more
 zones and at least one zone contains an empty non-terminal entry containing
 an asterisk ("*") character, this defect cannot be encountered. A would-be
 attacker who is allowed to change zone content could theoretically
 introduce such a record in order to exploit this condition to cause denial
 of service, though we consider the use of this vector unlikely because any
 such attack would require a significant privilege level and be easily
 traceable.
