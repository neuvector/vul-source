Description:
 An issue was discovered in Jinja2 2.10. The from_string function is prone
 to Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) where it takes the "source"
 parameter as a template object, renders it, and then returns it. The
 attacker can exploit it with {{INJECTION COMMANDS}} in a URI. NOTE: The
 maintainer and multiple third parties believe that this vulnerability isn't
 valid because users shouldn't use untrusted templates without sandboxing
