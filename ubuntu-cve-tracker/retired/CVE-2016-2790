Description:
 The graphite2::TtfUtil::GetTableInfo function in Graphite 2 before 1.3.6,
 as used in Mozilla Firefox before 45.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.7,
 does not initialize memory for an unspecified data structure, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unknown
 other impact via a crafted Graphite smart font.
