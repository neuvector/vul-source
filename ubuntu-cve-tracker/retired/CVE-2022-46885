Description:
 Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Ashley Hale, and the Mozilla Fuzzing
 Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 105. Some of these bugs
 showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort
 some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 106.
