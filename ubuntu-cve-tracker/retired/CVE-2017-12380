Description:
 ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
 that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
 service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to
 improper input validation checking mechanisms in mbox.c during certain mail
 parsing functions of the ClamAV software. An unauthenticated, remote
 attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the
 affected device. An exploit could trigger a NULL pointer dereference
 condition when ClamAV scans the malicious email, which may result in a DoS
 condition.
