Description:
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according
 to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal
 file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container
 process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem
 namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host
 filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image
 to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through
 runc run ("attack 1"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to
 overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container
 escapes ("attack 3a" and "attack 3b"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for
 this issue.
