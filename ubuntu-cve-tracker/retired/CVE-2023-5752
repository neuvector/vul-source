Description:
 When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL  (ie "pip install
 hg+...") with pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision could
  be used to inject arbitrary configuration options to the "hg clone"
 call (ie "--config"). Controlling the Mercurial configuration can modify
  how and which repository is installed. This vulnerability does not
 affect users who aren't installing from Mercurial.
