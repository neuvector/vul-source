Description:
 A flaw was found in HAProxy before 2.0.6. In legacy mode, messages
 featuring a transfer-encoding header missing the "chunked" value were not
 being correctly rejected. The impact was limited but if combined with the
 "http-reuse always" setting, it could be used to help construct an HTTP
 request smuggling attack against a vulnerable component employing a lenient
 parser that would ignore the content-length header as soon as it saw a
 transfer-encoding one (even if not entirely valid according to the
 specification).
