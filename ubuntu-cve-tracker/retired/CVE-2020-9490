Description:
 Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43. A specially crafted value for
 the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when
 the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring
 the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for
 unpatched servers.
