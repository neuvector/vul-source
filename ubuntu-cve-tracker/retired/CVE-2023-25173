Description:
 containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in
 containerd prior to versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18 where supplementary groups
 are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has direct
 access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access,
 they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group
 restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive
 information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.
 Downstream applications that use the containerd client library may be
 affected as well. This bug has been fixed in containerd v1.6.18 and
 v.1.5.18. Users should update to these versions and recreate containers to
 resolve this issue. Users who rely on a downstream application that uses
 containerd's client library should check that application for a separate
 advisory and instructions. As a workaround, ensure that the `"USER
 $USERNAME"` Dockerfile instruction is not used. Instead, set the container
 entrypoint to a value similar to `ENTRYPOINT ["su", "-", "user"]` to allow
 `su` to properly set up supplementary groups.
