Description:
 Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete
 and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A heap buffer overflow
 was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0,
 such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and
 C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of
 image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write
 metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit
 the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into
 running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered
 when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation
 than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2
 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument
 such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to
 upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
