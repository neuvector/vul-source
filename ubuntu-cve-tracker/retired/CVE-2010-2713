Description:
 The vte_sequence_handler_window_manipulation function in vteseq.c in libvte
 (aka libvte9) in VTE 0.25.1 and earlier, as used in gnome-terminal, does
 not properly handle escape sequences, which allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary commands or obtain potentially sensitive information via
 a (1) window title or (2) icon title sequence.  NOTE: this issue exists
 because of a CVE-2003-0070 regression.
