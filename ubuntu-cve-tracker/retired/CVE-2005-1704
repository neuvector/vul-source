Description:
 Integer overflow in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library for gdb before
 6.3, binutils, elfutils, and possibly other packages, allows user-assisted
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted object file that
 specifies a large number of section headers, leading to a heap-based buffer
 overflow.
