Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 37.0 relies on docshell type information instead of
 page principal information for Window.webidl access control, which might
 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome
 privileges via certain content navigation that leverages the reachability
 of a privileged window with an unintended persistence of access to
 restricted internal methods.
