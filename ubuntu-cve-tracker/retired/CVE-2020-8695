Description:
 Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel(R) Processors
 may allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure
 via local access.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Andreas Kogler, David Oswald,
 Catherine Easdon, Claudio Canella, and Daniel Gruss discovered that
 the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) feature of some Intel
 processors allowed a side-channel attack based on power consumption
 measurements. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose
 sensitive information.
