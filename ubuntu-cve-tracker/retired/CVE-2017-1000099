Description:
 When asking to get a file from a file:// URL, libcurl provides a feature
 that outputs meta-data about the file using HTTP-like headers. The code
 doing this would send the wrong buffer to the user (stdout or the
 application's provide callback), which could lead to other private data
 from the heap to get inadvertently displayed. The wrong buffer was an
 uninitialized memory area allocated on the heap and if it turned out to not
 contain any zero byte, it would continue and display the data following
 that buffer in memory.
