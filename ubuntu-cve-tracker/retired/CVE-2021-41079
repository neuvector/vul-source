Description:
 Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.63, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.43 and 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.2
 did not properly validate incoming TLS packets. When Tomcat was configured
 to use NIO+OpenSSL or NIO2+OpenSSL for TLS, a specially crafted packet
 could be used to trigger an infinite loop resulting in a denial of service.
