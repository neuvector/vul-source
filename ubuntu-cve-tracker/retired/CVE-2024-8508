Description:
 NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a
 vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to
 perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large
 RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name
 compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance
 and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The
 vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for
 the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets.
 Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression
 which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole
 packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the
 number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet.
 Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets
 or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the
 CPU for long. This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.
