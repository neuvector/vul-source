Description:
 lxml is a library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language. Prior
 to version 4.6.5, the HTML Cleaner in lxml.html lets certain crafted script
 content pass through, as well as script content in SVG files embedded using
 data URIs. Users that employ the HTML cleaner in a security relevant
 context should upgrade to lxml 4.6.5 to receive a patch. There are no known
 workarounds available.
