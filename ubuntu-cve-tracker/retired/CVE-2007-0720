Description:
 The CUPS service on multiple platforms allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (service hang) via a "partially-negotiated" SSL
 connection, which prevents other requests from being accepted.

Notes: 
 kees> The "fix" isn't really a fix, and just worsens the diagnostics available to an admin seeking the DoS.  This is a design problem with CUPS.
