Description:
 Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.19, as used in Mozilla
 Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.8 and 38.x before 38.1,
 Thunderbird before 38.1, and other products, does not properly determine
 state transitions for the TLS state machine, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by blocking
 messages, as demonstrated by removing a forward-secrecy property by
 blocking a ServerKeyExchange message, aka a "SMACK SKIP-TLS" issue.
