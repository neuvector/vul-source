Description:
 A remote code execution vulnerability in libxml2 could enable an attacker
 using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context
 of an unprivileged process. This issue is rated as High due to the
 possibility of remote code execution in an application that uses this
 library. Product: Android. Versions: 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0,
 7.1.1, 7.1.2. Android ID: A-37104170.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Downgrading from high to medium as the invalid write consists of a
  an enum member within a struct being written with a constant value that's not
  attacker controlled. I suspect that this is quite difficult to exploit.
