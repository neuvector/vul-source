Description:
 Drupal's JSON:API and REST/File modules allow file uploads through their
 HTTP APIs. The modules do not correctly run all file validation, which
 causes an access bypass vulnerability. An attacker might be able to upload
 files that bypass the file validation process implemented by modules on the
 site.
