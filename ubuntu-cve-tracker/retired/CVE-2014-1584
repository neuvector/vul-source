Description:
 The Public Key Pinning (PKP) implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0
 skips pinning checks upon an unspecified issuer-verification error, which
 makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass an intended pinning
 configuration and spoof a web site via a crafted certificate that leads to
 presentation of the Untrusted Connection dialog to the user.
