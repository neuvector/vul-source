Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in functions.php in the default
 theme in WordPress 2.2 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject
 arbitrary web script or HTML via the PATH_INFO (REQUEST_URI) to
 wp-admin/themes.php, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-1622.  NOTE:
 this might not cross privilege boundaries in some configurations, since the
 Administrator role has the unfiltered_html capability.
