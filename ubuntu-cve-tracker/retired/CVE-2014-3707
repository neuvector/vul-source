Description:
 The curl_easy_duphandle function in libcurl 7.17.1 through 7.38.0, when
 running with the CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option, does not properly copy HTTP
 POST data for an easy handle, which triggers an out-of-bounds read that
 allows remote web servers to read sensitive memory information.
