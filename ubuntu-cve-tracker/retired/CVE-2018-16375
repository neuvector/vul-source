 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4782-1
Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenJPEG 2.3.0. Missing checks for
 header_info.height and header_info.width in the function pnmtoimage in
 bin/jpwl/convert.c can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenJPEG incorrectly handled certain PNM files. A
 remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu packages are built with -DBUILD_JPWL:BOOL=OFF, so the
 mdeslaur> vulnerable code isn't compiled
 ccdm94> the openjpeg package does not include the file patched by commit
 ccdm94> 619e1b086ea. Before the refactoring, there was a single convert.c
 ccdm94> file, which according to the code, seems to be affected by this
 ccdm94> vulnerability, however, it seems like the vulnerability in this
 ccdm94> case is related to CVE-2016-9118 instead, which has a very similar
 ccdm94> patch.
