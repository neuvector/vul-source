Description:
 The unity-firefox-extension package could be tricked into destroying the
 Unity webapps context, causing Firefox to crash. This could be achieved by
 spinning the event loop inside the webapps initialization callback. Fixed
 in 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 by shipping an empty package, thus
 disabling the extension entirely.
