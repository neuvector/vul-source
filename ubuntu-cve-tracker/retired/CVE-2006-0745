Description:
 X.Org server (xorg-server) 1.0.0 and later, X11R6.9.0, and X11R7.0
 inadvertently treats the address of the geteuid function as if it is the
 return value of a call to geteuid, which allows local users to bypass
 intended restrictions and (1) execute arbitrary code via the -modulepath
 command line option or (2) overwrite arbitrary files via -logfile.
