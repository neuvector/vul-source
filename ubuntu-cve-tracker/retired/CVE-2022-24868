Description:
 GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package, that provides ITIL
 Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In versions
 prior to 10.0.0 one can exploit a lack of sanitization on SVG file uploads
 and inject javascript into their user avatar. As a result any user viewing
 the avatar will be subject to a cross site scripting attack. Users of GLPI
 are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disallow SVG
 avatars.
