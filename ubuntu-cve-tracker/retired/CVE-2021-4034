Description:
 A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec
 utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow
 unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined
 policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling
 parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables
 as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment
 variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When
 successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation
 given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.
