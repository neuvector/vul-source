Description:
 The session_start function in ext/session in PHP 4.x up to 4.4.7 and 5.x up
 to 5.2.3 allows remote attackers to insert arbitrary attributes into the
 session cookie via special characters in a cookie that is obtained from (1)
 PATH_INFO, (2) the session_id function, and (3) the session_start function,
 which are not encoded or filtered when the new session cookie is generated,
 a related issue to CVE-2006-0207.
