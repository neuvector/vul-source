Description:
 The unity-firefox-extension package could be tricked into dropping a C
 callback which was still in use, which Firefox would then free, causing
 Firefox to crash. This could be achieved by adding an action to the
 launcher and updating it with new callbacks until the libunity-webapps rate
 limit was hit. Fixed in 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 of
 unity-firefox-extension and in all versions of libunity-webapps by shipping
 an empty unity-firefox-extension package, thus disabling the extension
 entirely and invalidating the attack against the libunity-webapps package.
