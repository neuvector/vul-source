Description:
 In libxslt 1.1.29 and earlier, the EXSLT math.random function was not
 initialized with a random seed during startup, which could cause usage of
 this function to produce predictable outputs.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> upstream fixed this for xsltproc, but libxslt remains unfixed
 sbeattie> not clear what the security impact of this is
 mdeslaur> as of 2022-08-05, no indication that upstream will fix this
 ccdm94> there is no upstream patch provided for this issue. The random
 ccdm94> function in libxslt does not guarantee it will adhere to all
 ccdm94> cryptographic requirements, and applications using libxslt are
 ccdm94> expected to be the ones performing the seeding of the system's
 ccdm94> PRNG in order to achieve proper randomness. For this reason,
 ccdm94> status for all releases will be set to ignored.
