Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling requests from
 users, Squid checks its rules to see if the request should be denied. Squid
 by default comes with rules to block access to the Cache Manager, which
 serves detailed server information meant for the maintainer. This rule is
 implemented via url_regex. The handler for url_regex rules URL decodes an
 incoming request. This allows an attacker to encode their URL to bypass the
 url_regex check, and gain access to the blocked resource.
