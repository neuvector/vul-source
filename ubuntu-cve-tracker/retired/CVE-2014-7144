Description:
 OpenStack keystonemiddleware (formerly python-keystoneclient) 0.x before
 0.11.0 and 1.x before 1.2.0 disables certification verification when the
 "insecure" option is set in a paste configuration (paste.ini) file
 regardless of the value, which allows remote attackers to conduct
 man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted certificate.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> will not be fixed before 14.10 goes EoL
 mdeslaur> upstream patch requires a more recent version of oslo.config
 mdeslaur> than what is currently in trusty
