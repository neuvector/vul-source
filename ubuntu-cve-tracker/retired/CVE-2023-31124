Description:
 c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When cross-compiling c-ares and
 using the autotools build system, CARES_RANDOM_FILE will not be set, as
 seen when cross compiling aarch64 android. This will downgrade to using
 rand() as a fallback which could allow an attacker to take advantage of the
 lack of entropy by not using a CSPRNG. This issue was patched in version
 1.19.1.
