Description:
 Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data
 buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens
 the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they
 leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the
 bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large
 response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can
 consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
