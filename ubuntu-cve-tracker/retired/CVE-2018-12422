Description:
 addressbook/backends/ldap/e-book-backend-ldap.c in Evolution-Data-Server in
 GNOME Evolution through 3.29.2 might allow attackers to trigger a Buffer
 Overflow via a long query that is processed by the strcat function. NOTE:
 the software maintainer disputes this because "the code had computed the
 required string length first, and then allocated a large-enough buffer on
 the heap.
