Description:
 A flaw was found in the QEMU Virtio PCI Bindings (hw/virtio/virtio-pci.c).
 An improper release and use of the irqfd for vector 0 during the boot
 process leads to a guest triggerable crash via vhost_net_stop(). This flaw
 allows a malicious guest to crash the QEMU process on the host.
