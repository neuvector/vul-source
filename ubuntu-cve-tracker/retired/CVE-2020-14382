Description:
 A vulnerability was found in upstream release cryptsetup-2.2.0 where,
 there's a bug in LUKS2 format validation code, that is effectively invoked
 on every device/image presenting itself as LUKS2 container. The bug is in
 segments validation code in file 'lib/luks2/luks2_json_metadata.c' in
 function hdr_validate_segments(struct crypt_device *cd, json_object
 *hdr_jobj) where the code does not check for possible overflow on memory
 allocation used for intervals array (see statement "intervals =
 malloc(first_backup * sizeof(*intervals));"). Due to the bug, library can
 be *tricked* to expect such allocation was successful but for far less
 memory then originally expected. Later it may read data FROM image crafted
 by an attacker and actually write such data BEYOND allocated memory.
