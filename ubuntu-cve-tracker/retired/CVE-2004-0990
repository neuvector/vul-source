 Integer overflow in GD Graphics Library libgd 2.0.28 (libgd2), and possibly
 other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via PNG image files with large image rows
 values that lead to a heap-based buffer overflow in the
 gdImageCreateFromPngCtx function, a different set of vulnerabilities than
 CVE-2004-0941.
