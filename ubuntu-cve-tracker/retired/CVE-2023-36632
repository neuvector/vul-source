Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The legacy email.utils.parseaddr function in Python through
 3.11.4 allows attackers to trigger "RecursionError: maximum recursion depth
 exceeded while calling a Python object" via a crafted argument. This
 argument is plausibly an untrusted value from an application's input data
 that was supposed to contain a name and an e-mail address. NOTE:
 email.utils.parseaddr is categorized as a Legacy API in the documentation
 of the Python email package. Applications should instead use the
 email.parser.BytesParser or email.parser.Parser class. NOTE: the vendor's
 perspective is that this is neither a vulnerability nor a bug. The email
 package is intended to have size limits and to throw an exception when
 limits are exceeded; they were exceeded by the example demonstration code.
