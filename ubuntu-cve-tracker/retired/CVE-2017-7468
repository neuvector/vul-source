Description:
 In curl and libcurl 7.52.0 to and including 7.53.1, libcurl would attempt
 to resume a TLS session even if the client certificate had changed. That is
 unacceptable since a server by specification is allowed to skip the client
 certificate check on resume, and may instead use the old identity which was
 established by the previous certificate (or no certificate). libcurl
 supports by default the use of TLS session id/ticket to resume previous TLS
 sessions to speed up subsequent TLS handshakes. They are used when for any
 reason an existing TLS connection couldn't be kept alive to make the next
 handshake faster. This flaw is a regression and identical to CVE-2016-5419
 reported on August 3rd 2016, but affecting a different version range.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled client certificates
 when resuming a TLS session. A remote attacker could use this to hijack
 a previously authenticated connection.
Notes:
 sbeattie> reported upstream mitigation:
  Set `CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE` to 0L when using client certificates
