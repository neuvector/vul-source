Description:
 In the Admin Package Manager in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) 5.0.0
 through 5.0.24 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.1, authenticated admins are able to
 exploit a Blind Remote Code Execution vulnerability by loading a crafted
 opm file with an embedded CodeInstall element to execute a command on the
 server during package installation.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue
 stating "the behaviour is as designed and needed for different packages to
 be installed", "there is a security warning if the package is not verified
 by OTRS Group", and "there is the possibility and responsibility of an
 admin to check packages before installation which is possible as they are
 not binary.
