Description:
 multipath-tools 0.7.7 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to
 obtain root access, as exploited in conjunction with CVE-2022-41974. Local
 users able to access /dev/shm can change symlinks in multipathd due to
 incorrect symlink handling, which could lead to controlled file writes
 outside of the /dev/shm directory. This could be used indirectly for local
 privilege escalation to root.
