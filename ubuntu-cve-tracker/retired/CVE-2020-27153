Description:
 In BlueZ before 5.55, a double free was found in the gatttool
 disconnect_cb() routine from shared/att.c. A remote attacker could
 potentially cause a denial of service or code execution, during service
 discovery, due to a redundant disconnect MGMT event.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> per Red Hat, there is currently no known path to code execution
 mdeslaur> as there is a small time window between the two calls to free()
 mdeslaur> as such, marking as low priority.
