Description:
 An issue was discovered in Ubuntu wpa_supplicant that resulted in loading
 of arbitrary shared objects, which allows a local unprivileged attacker to
 escalate privileges to the user that wpa_supplicant runs as (usually root).
 
 
 
 
 Membership in the netdev group or access to the dbus interface of
 wpa_supplicant allow an unprivileged user to specify an arbitrary path to a
 module to be loaded by the wpa_supplicant process; other escalation paths
 might exist.
