Description:
 An attacker who could have convinced a user to drag and drop an image to a
 filesystem could have manipulated the resulting filename to contain an
 executable extension, and by extension potentially tricked the user into
 executing malicious code. While very similar, this is a separate issue from
 CVE-2022-34483. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102.
