Description:
 An issue was discovered in Cinnamon 1.9.2 through 3.8.6. The
 cinnamon-settings-users.py GUI runs as root and allows configuration of
 (for example) other users' icon files in _on_face_browse_menuitem_activated
 and _on_face_menuitem_activated. These icon files are written to the
 respective user's $HOME/.face location. If an unprivileged user prepares a
 symlink pointing to an arbitrary location, then this location will be
 overwritten with the icon content.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Matthias Gerstner discovered that the cinnamon-settings-users utility in
 Cinnamon did not safely handle symlinks. An unprivileged user could potentially
 use this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files as root.
