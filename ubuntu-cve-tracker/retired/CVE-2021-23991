 If a Thunderbird user has previously imported Alice's OpenPGP key, and
 Alice has extended the validity period of her key, but Alice's updated key
 has not yet been imported, an attacker may send an email containing a
 crafted version of Alice's key with an invalid subkey, Thunderbird might
 subsequently attempt to use the invalid subkey, and will fail to send
 encrypted email to Alice. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.
