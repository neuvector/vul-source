Description:
 spread uses a temporary file with a static filename based on the port
 number, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by creating
 the file during a race condition between unlink and bind function calls.
 NOTE: spread deletes this temporary file before use, which could cause
 conflicts with other programs that use the same filename, but this is not a
 distinct issue.
