Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation
 functionality in Ruby 1.9.3-p194, when installed in the top-level C:\
 directory, might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse
 DLL in the C:\Ruby193\bin directory, which may be added to the PATH system
 environment variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse
 wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system
 service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and
 Windows 8 Release Preview.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the
 unsafe PATH is established only by a separate administrative action that is
 not a default part of the Ruby installation.
