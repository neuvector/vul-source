Description:
 An issue was discovered in dhclient 4.3.1-6 due to an embedded path
 variable.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> In Ubuntu, the build directory is set to 
 mdeslaur> PATH=/build/buildd/isc-dhcp-4.2.4/debian/tmp/usr/sbin.
 mdeslaur> since it is a top-level directory, the attacker would need to
 mdeslaur> be root to exploit this. Also, USN-1571-1 sets an explicit
 mdeslaur> PATH in dhclient-script, so it's likely we're not vulnerable at
 mdeslaur> all.
