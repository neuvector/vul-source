Description:
 When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature,
 thecontents is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML
 file.The metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the same
 contentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by different
 servers and theclient can then download the file from one or several of
 them. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the
 contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that
 server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the
 hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the
 contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not
 done, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the
 potentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> introduced in 7.27.0
 mdeslaur> per upstream "curl has completely removed the metalink feature
 mdeslaur> as of 7.78.0. No fix for this flaw will be produced by the curl
 mdeslaur> project. The fix for earlier versions is to rebuild curl
 mdeslaur> with the metalink support switched off!"
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu builds curl with metalink support switched off already.
