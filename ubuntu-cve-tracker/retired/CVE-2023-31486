Description:
 HTTP::Tiny before 0.083, a Perl core module since 5.13.9 and available
 standalone on CPAN, has an insecure default TLS configuration where users
 must opt in to verify certificates.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> It seems like upstream will not be fixing this issue due to the
 ccdm94> large risk that it might break things and in order to maintain
 ccdm94> backwards compatibility. As per the information available in
 ccdm94> https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny#SSL-SUPPORTIt, HTTP:Tiny
 ccdm94> aims to not make assumptions about trust models chosen by users,
 ccdm94> and, therefore, according to the documentation and upstream's
 ccdm94> position regarding this issue (see p5-http-tiny issues 68 and
 ccdm94> 134), it is recommended that users set the verify_SSL option in
 ccdm94> their own code in order to apply certificate verification
 ccdm94> functionalities to their applications. Due to the risk of this
 ccdm94> issue introducing regressions and all that has been mentioned
 ccdm94> up to this point, releases will be marked as ignored.
