Description:
 The ap_proxy_http_process_response function in mod_proxy_http.c in the
 mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.63 and 2.2.8 does not limit
 the number of forwarded interim responses, which allows remote HTTP servers
 to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of
 interim responses.
