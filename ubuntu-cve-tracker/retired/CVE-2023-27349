Description:
 BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP Improper Validation of Array Index Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via Bluetooth on affected installations
 of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in
 that the target must connect to a malicious device. The specific flaw
 exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue results from
 the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a
 write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this
 vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19908.
