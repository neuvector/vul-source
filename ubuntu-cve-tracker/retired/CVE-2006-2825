Description:
 cPanel does not automatically synchronize the PHP open_basedir
 configuration directive between the main server and virtual hosts that
 share physical directories, which might allow a local user to bypass
 open_basedir restrictions and access other virtual hosts via a PHP script
 that uses a main server URL (such as ~username) that is blocked by the
 user's own open_basedir directive, but not the main server's open_basedir
 directive.
