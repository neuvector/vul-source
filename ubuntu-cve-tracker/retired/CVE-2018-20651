Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in elf_link_add_object_symbols in
 elflink.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as
 distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31.1. This occurs for a crafted ET_DYN with
 no program headers. A specially crafted ELF file allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by ld.
