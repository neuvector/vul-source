Description:
 The GENERATE_SEED macro in PHP 4.x before 4.4.8 and 5.x before 5.2.5, when
 running on 64-bit systems, performs a multiplication that generates a
 portion of zero bits during conversion due to insufficient precision, which
 produces 24 bits of entropy and simplifies brute force attacks against
 protection mechanisms that use the rand and mt_rand functions.
