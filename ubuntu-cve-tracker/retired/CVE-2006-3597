Description:
 passwd before 1:4.0.13 on Ubuntu 6.06 LTS leaves the root password blank
 instead of locking it when the administrator selects the "Go Back" option
 after the final "Installation complete" message and uses the main menu,
 which causes the password to be zeroed out in the installer's memory.
