Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in PHP 4 before 4.4.8, and PHP 5 before 5.2.4,
 allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) or
 cause a denial of service (thread crash) via a large len value to the (1)
 strspn or (2) strcspn function, which triggers an out-of-bounds read. 
 NOTE: this affects different product versions than CVE-2007-3996.
