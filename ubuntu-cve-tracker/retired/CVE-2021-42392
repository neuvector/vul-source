Description:
 The org.h2.util.JdbcUtils.getConnection method of the H2 database takes as
 parameters the class name of the driver and URL of the database. An
 attacker may pass a JNDI driver name and a URL leading to a LDAP or RMI
 servers, causing remote code execution. This can be exploited through
 various attack vectors, most notably through the H2 Console which leads to
 unauthenticated remote code execution.
