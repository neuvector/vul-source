Description:
 Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy web
 services. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to
 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or
 Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled is affected. A lack of
 input validation allows authenticated clients to proxy requests to other
 hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication is
 required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests via
 kernel or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity.
 Users may upgrade to version 3.2.1 to receive a patch or, as a workaround,
 install the patch manually.
