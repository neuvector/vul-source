Description:
 manage_user_page.php in Mantis 1.00rc4 and earlier does not properly handle
 a sort parameter containing a ' (quote) character, which allows remote
 attackers to trigger a SQL error that may be repeatedly reported to a user
 who makes subsequent web accesses with the MANTIS_MANAGE_COOKIE cookie. 
 NOTE: this issue might be the same as vector 2 in CVE-2005-4519.
