Description:
 When generating the systemd service units for the docker snap (and other
 similar snaps), snapd does not specify Delegate=yes - as a result systemd
 will move processes from the containers created and managed by these snaps
 into the cgroup of the main daemon within the snap itself when reloading
 system units. This may grant additional privileges to a container within
 the snap that were not originally intended.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Gilad Reti and Nimrod Stoler discovered that snapd did not correctly
 specify cgroup delegation when generating systemd service units for
 various container management snaps. This could allow a local attacker to
 escalate privileges via access to arbitrary devices of the container host
 from within a compromised or malicious container.
