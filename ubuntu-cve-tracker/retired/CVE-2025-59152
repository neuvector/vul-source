Description:
 Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. In
 version 2.17.0, rate limits can be completely bypassed by manipulating the
 X-Forwarded-For header. This renders IP-based rate limiting ineffective
 against determined attackers. Litestar's RateLimitMiddleware uses
 `cache_key_from_request()` to generate cache keys for rate limiting. When
 an X-Forwarded-For header is present, the middleware trusts it
 unconditionally and uses its value as part of the client identifier. Since
 clients can set arbitrary X-Forwarded-For values, each different spoofed IP
 creates a separate rate limit bucket. An attacker can rotate through
 different header values to avoid hitting any single bucket's limit. This
 affects any Litestar application using RateLimitMiddleware with default
 settings, which likely includes most applications that implement rate
 limiting. Version 2.18.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.
