Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mozilla 1.7.12 and possibly
 earlier, Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 and possibly earlier, and Netscape 8.1 and
 possibly earlier, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or
 HTML via the -moz-binding (Cascading Style Sheets) CSS property, which does
 not require that the style sheet have the same origin as the web page, as
 demonstrated by the compromise of a large number of LiveJournal accounts.
