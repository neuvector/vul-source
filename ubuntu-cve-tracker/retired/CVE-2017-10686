Description:
 In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there are multiple heap use after free
 vulnerabilities in the tool nasm. The related heap is allocated in the
 token() function and freed in the detoken() function (called by
 pp_getline()) - it is used again at multiple positions later that could
 cause multiple damages. For example, it causes a corrupted double-linked
 list in detoken(), a double free or corruption in delete_Token(), and an
 out-of-bounds write in detoken(). It has a high possibility to lead to a
 remote code execution attack.
