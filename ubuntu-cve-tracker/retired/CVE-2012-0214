Description:
 The pkgAcqMetaClearSig::Failed method in apt-pkg/acquire-item.cc in
 Advanced Package Tool (APT) 0.8.11 through 0.8.15.10 and 0.8.16 before
 0.8.16~exp13, when updating from repositories that use InRelease files,
 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to install arbitrary packages by
 preventing a user from downloading the new InRelease file, which leaves the
 original InRelease file active and makes it more difficult to detect that
 the Packages file is modified and unsigned.
