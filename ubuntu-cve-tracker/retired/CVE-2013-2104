Description:
 python-keystoneclient before 0.2.4, as used in OpenStack Keystone (Folsom),
 does not properly check expiry for PKI tokens, which allows remote
 authenticated users to (1) retain use of a token after it has expired, or
 (2) use a revoked token once it expires.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per upstream, code introduced in keystone in Folsom (Ubuntu 12.10).
  For Grizzly (13.10), code moved to python-keystoneclient
 jdstrand> PKI tokens not available on Essex (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)
 jdstrand> PKI are not used by default in Folsom (Ubuntu 12.10)
 jdstrand> the update for 12.10 was superseded by an SRU. While keystone in
  12.10 uses UUID tokens instead of PKI tokens, an update will be provided for
  12.10 soon.
