Description:
 An issue was discovered in uIP 1.0, as used in Contiki 3.0 and other
 products. The code that reassembles fragmented packets fails to properly
 validate the total length of an incoming packet specified in its IP header,
 as well as the fragmentation offset value specified in the IP header. By
 crafting a packet with specific values of the IP header length and the
 fragmentation offset, attackers can write into the .bss section of the
 program (past the statically allocated buffer that is used for storing the
 fragmented data) and cause a denial of service in uip_reass() in uip.c, or
 possibly execute arbitrary code on some target architectures.
