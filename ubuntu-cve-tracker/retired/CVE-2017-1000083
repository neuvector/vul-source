Description:
 backend/comics/comics-document.c (aka the comic book backend) in GNOME
 Evince before 3.24.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands
 via a .cbt file that is a TAR archive containing a filename beginning with
 a "--" command-line option substring, as demonstrated by a
 --checkpoint-action=exec=bash at the beginning of the filename.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Felix Wilhelm discovered that Evince did not safely invoke tar when
 handling tar comic book (cbt) files. An attacker could use this to
 construct a malicious comic book format file that, when opened in
 Evince, executes arbitrary code.
Notes:
 sbeattie> upstream evince in git has switched to using libarchive
 sbeattie> The fix for this issue disables CBT support, as tar offers to
   many opportunities to invoke commands and CBT is a rarely used comic
   book format.
