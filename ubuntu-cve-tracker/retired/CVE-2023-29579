Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** yasm 1.3.0.55.g101bc was discovered to contain a stack
 overflow via the component yasm/yasm+0x43b466 in vsprintf. Note: This has
 been disputed by third parties who argue this is a bug and not a security
 issue because yasm is a standalone program not designed to run untrusted
 code.
