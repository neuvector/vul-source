Description:
 Roaring Penguin pppoe (rp-ppoe), if installed or configured to run setuid
 root contrary to its design, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary
 files.  NOTE: the developer has publicly disputed the claim that this is a
 vulnerability because pppoe "is NOT designed to run setuid-root."
 Therefore this identifier applies *only* to those configurations and
 installations under which pppoe is run setuid root despite the developer's
 warnings.
