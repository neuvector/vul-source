Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Gifsicle through 1.94, if deployed in a way that allows
 untrusted input to affect Gif_Realloc calls, might allow a denial of
 service (memory consumption). NOTE: this has been disputed by multiple
 parties because the Gifsicle code is not commonly used for unattended
 operation in which new input arrives for a long-running process, does not
 ship with functionality to link it into another application as a library,
 and does not have realistic use cases in which an adversary controls the
 entire command line.
