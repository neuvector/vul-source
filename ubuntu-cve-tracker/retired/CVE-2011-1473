Description:
 OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, and 0.9.8m through 1.x, does not properly restrict
 client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protocols, which
 might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
 consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connection,
 a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-5094.  NOTE: it can also be argued
 that it is the responsibility of server deployments, not a security
 library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within
 a specific environment
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Protocol issue. Nothing to be done at this time. Marking low
  because while renegotiation makes the DoS faster, standard DoS methods
  still apply for SSL servers that need to setup the SSL connection.
 jdstrand> per Redhat, should not affect httpd/mod_ssl
 mdeslaur> this CVE is specific to openssl, nss is in CVE-2011-5094
 mdeslaur> we're not going to fix this, since it's disputed
