Description:
 In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a request
 through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another
 unknown client. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client
 adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as
 the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and
 when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy
 does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma
 to send another request for a different client, the second response from
 the first client will be sent to the second client. This is a similar but
 different vulnerability from CVE-2020-11076. The problem has been fixed in
 Puma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.
