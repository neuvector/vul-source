Description:
 An error in handling certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a
 server is using the nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it
 is also providing authoritative service. A vulnerable server could be
 intentionally stopped by an attacker if it was using a configuration that
 met the criteria for the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it
 to accept a query that possessed the required attributes. Please note: This
 vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature, which is one of two
 methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only available in certain
 versions of BIND. Redirection using zones of type "redirect" is not
 affected by this vulnerability. Affects BIND 9.9.8-S1 -> 9.9.8-S3, 9.9.9-S1
 -> 9.9.9-S6, 9.11.0-9.11.0-P1.
