Description:
 systemd 250 and 251 allows local users to achieve a systemd-coredump
 deadlock by triggering a crash that has a long backtrace. This occurs in
 parse_elf_object in shared/elf-util.c. The exploitation methodology is to
 crash a binary calling the same function recursively, and put it in a
 deeply nested directory to make its backtrace large enough to cause the
 deadlock. This must be done 16 times when MaxConnections=16 is set for the
 systemd/units/systemd-coredump.socket file.
