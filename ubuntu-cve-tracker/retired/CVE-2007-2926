Description:
 ISC BIND 9 through 9.5.0a5 uses a weak random number generator during
 generation of DNS query ids when answering resolver questions or sending
 NOTIFY messages to slave name servers, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to guess the next query id and perform DNS cache poisoning.
