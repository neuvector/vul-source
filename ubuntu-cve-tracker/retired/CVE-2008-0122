Description:
 Off-by-one error in the inet_network function in libbind in ISC BIND 9.4.2
 and earlier, as used in libc in FreeBSD 6.2 through 7.0-PRERELEASE, allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted input that triggers memory
 corruption.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
  jdstrand> from RH bug: This problem allows an attacker to write 1 unsigned
    long int value (4 or 8 bytes, depending on the platform used) beyond the
    end of the buffer.  This overwrite is too short to modify function return
    address, so this problem does not seem to be easily exploitable or
    verifiable using reproducer.
  jdstrand> nothing linked against libbind9 in any Ubuntu releases, except for
    bind9 packages, and upstream says that none of the applications shipped with
    BIND 9 call inet_network()
