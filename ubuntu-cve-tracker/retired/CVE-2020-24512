Description:
 Observable timing discrepancy in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an
 authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local
 access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Travis Downs discovered that some Intel processors did not properly flush
 cache-lines for trivial-data values. This may allow an unauthorized user to
 infer the presence of these trivial-data-cache-lines via timing sidechannel
 attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.
