Description:
 CRLF injection vulnerability in the FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL filter in
 ext/filter in PHP 5.2.0 and 5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to
 inject arbitrary e-mail headers via an e-mail address with a '\n'
 character, which causes a regular expression to ignore the subsequent part
 of the address string.
