Description:
 A memory corruption issue was found in DPDK versions 17.05 and above. This
 flaw is caused by an integer truncation on the index of a payload. Under
 certain circumstances, the index (a UInt) is copied and truncated into a
 uint16, which can lead to out of bound indexing and possible memory
 corruption.
