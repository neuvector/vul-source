Description:
 Integer overflow in RealNetworks RealPlayer 8, 10, and 10.5, RealOne Player
 1 and 2, and Helix Player 10.0.0 allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via an .rm movie file with a large value in the length field
 of the first data packet, which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1481.
