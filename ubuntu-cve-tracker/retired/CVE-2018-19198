Description:
 An issue was discovered in uriparser before 0.9.0. UriQuery.c allows an
 out-of-bounds write via a uriComposeQuery* or uriComposeQueryEx* function
 because the '&' character is mishandled in certain contexts.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that uriparser mishandled certain input. An attacker could
 use this vulnerability to cause uriparser to crash or possibly execute
 arbitrary code.
