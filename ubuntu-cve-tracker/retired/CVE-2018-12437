Description:
 LibTomCrypt through 1.18.1 allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on
 ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To
 discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs access to either the local
 machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that LibTomCrypt incorrectly handled ECDSA signatures.
 A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive
 information.
