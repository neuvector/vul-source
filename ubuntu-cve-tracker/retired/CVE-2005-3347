Description:
 Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in phpSysInfo 2.4
 and earlier, as used in phpgroupware 0.9.16 and earlier, and egrouwpware
 before 1.0.0.009, allow remote attackers to include arbitrary files via ..
 (dot dot) sequences in the (1) sensor_program parameter or the (2)
 _SERVER[HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE] parameter, which overwrites an internal
 variable, a variant of CVE-2003-0536.  NOTE: due to a typo in an advisory,
 an issue in osh was inadvertently linked to this identifier; the proper
 identifier for the osh issue is CVE-2005-3346.
