Description:
 The navigator.sendBeacon implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 35.0,
 Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.4, Thunderbird before 31.4, and SeaMonkey before
 2.32 omits the CORS Origin header, which allows remote attackers to bypass
 intended CORS access-control checks and conduct cross-site request forgery
 (CSRF) attacks via a crafted web site.
