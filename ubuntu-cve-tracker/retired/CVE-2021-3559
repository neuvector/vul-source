Description:
 A flaw was found in libvirt in the virConnectListAllNodeDevices API in
 versions before 7.0.0. It only affects hosts with a PCI device and driver
 that supports mediated devices (e.g., GRID driver). This flaw could be used
 by an unprivileged client with a read-only connection to crash the libvirt
 daemon by executing the 'nodedev-list' virsh command. The highest threat
 from this vulnerability is to system availability.
