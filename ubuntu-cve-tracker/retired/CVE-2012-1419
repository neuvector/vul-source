Description:
 The TAR file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 and Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal)
 11.00 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR
 file with an initial [aliases] character sequence. NOTE: this may later be
 SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing
 that the error occurred independently in different TAR parser
 implementations.
