Description:
 CenterIM 4.22.3 and earlier allows user-assisted remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a URI, related to
 "received URLs in the message window."  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
 due to the user-assisted nature, since the URL must be selected and
 launched by the victim
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per Debian, the victim needs to list the URLs in the message with F2
   and press enter on it. the victim can see the complete URL including the
   commands however so the impact is really low
