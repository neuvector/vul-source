Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
 Prior to version 1.2.27, an arbitrary file write vulnerability, exploitable
 through the "Package Import" feature, allows authenticated users having the
 "Import Templates" permission to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web
 server. The vulnerability is located within the `import_package()` function
 defined into the `/lib/import.php` script. The function blindly trusts the
 filename and file content provided within the XML data, and writes such
 files into the Cacti base path (or even outside, since path traversal
 sequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to write or overwrite
 arbitrary files on the web server, leading to execution of arbitrary PHP
 code or other security impacts. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for this
 issue.
