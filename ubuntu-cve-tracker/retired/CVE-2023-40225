Description:
 HAProxy through 2.0.32, 2.1.x and 2.2.x through 2.2.30, 2.3.x and 2.4.x
 through 2.4.23, 2.5.x and 2.6.x before 2.6.15, 2.7.x before 2.7.10, and
 2.8.x before 2.8.2 forwards empty Content-Length headers, violating RFC
 9110 section 8.6. In uncommon cases, an HTTP/1 server behind HAProxy may
 interpret the payload as an extra request.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> affected content-length headers parses were added in
  v1.9, with HTX mode. legacy mode in v2.0 and before has the correct check.
  hence, Ubuntu releases older than focal are not affected.
 rodrigo-zaiden> there is a followup commit to handle a specific corner
  case where leading zeroes on content-length are being preserved, and a
  bogus server could take it as a prefix, that being commit 22731762.
  upstream stated that the leading zeroes situation can still happen in
  versions older than v1.9, it could be addressed in v2.0+ (with HTX) but
  it is not feasible for older versions due to the way values are indexed.
  (more information on bug link)
Mitigation:
 frontend can reject requests with empty content-length header with the
 following rule
  http-request deny if { hdr_len(content-length) 0 }
