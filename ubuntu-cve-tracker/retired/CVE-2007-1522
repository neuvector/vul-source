Description:
 Double free vulnerability in the session extension in PHP 5.2.0 and 5.2.1
 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via illegal
 characters in a session identifier, which is rejected by an internal
 session storage module, which calls the session identifier generator with
 an improper environment, leading to code execution when the generator is
 interrupted, as demonstrated by triggering a memory limit violation or
 certain PHP errors.
