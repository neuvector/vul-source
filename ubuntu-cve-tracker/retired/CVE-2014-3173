Description:
 The WebGL implementation in Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.94 does not
 ensure that clear calls interact properly with the state of a draw buffer,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (read of
 uninitialized memory) via a crafted CANVAS element, related to
 gpu/command_buffer/service/framebuffer_manager.cc and
 gpu/command_buffer/service/gles2_cmd_decoder.cc.
