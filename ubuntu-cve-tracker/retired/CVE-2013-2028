Description:
 The ngx_http_parse_chunked function in http/ngx_http_parse.c in nginx 1.3.9
 through 1.4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
 and execute arbitrary code via a chunked Transfer-Encoding request with a
 large chunk size, which triggers an integer signedness error and a
 stack-based buffer overflow.
