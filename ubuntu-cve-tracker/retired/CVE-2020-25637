Description:
 A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API, in
 versions before 6.8.0, responsible for requesting information about network
 interfaces of a running QEMU domain. This flaw affects the polkit access
 control driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket
 with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt
 daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their
 privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
 data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Read-only clients can't exploit this flaw.
 mdeslaur> Clients connecting to the read-write socket can exploit this to
 mdeslaur> crash libvirt or possibly execute code, but on Ubuntu,
 mdeslaur> access to the read-write socket already grants root-equivalent
 mdeslaur> permissions, so this flaw has limited impact. Setting priority
 mdeslaur> to negligible.
