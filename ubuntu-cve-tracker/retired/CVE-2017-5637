 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2693
Description:
 Two four letter word commands "wchp/wchc" are CPU intensive and could cause
 spike of CPU utilization on Apache ZooKeeper server if abused, which leads
 to the server unable to serve legitimate client requests. Apache ZooKeeper
 thru version 3.4.9 and 3.5.2 suffer from this issue, fixed in 3.4.10,
 3.5.3, and later.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Apache ZooKeeper incorrectly implemented "wchp/wchc"
 commands. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
 service.
