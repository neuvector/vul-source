Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2, prior to version 2.06. An attacker may use the
 GRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process. This flaw
 also allows the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order to load an
 untrusted or modified kernel, an attacker would first need to establish
 access to the system such as gaining physical access, obtain the ability to
 alter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access to a networked system with
 root access. With this access, an attacker could then craft a string to
 cause a buffer overflow by injecting a malicious payload that leads to
 arbitrary code execution within GRUB. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
 availability.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Jesse Michael and Mickey Shkatov discovered that the configuration
 parser in GRUB2 did not properly exit when errors were discovered,
 resulting in heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could
 use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot
 restrictions.
Notes:
 alexmurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
