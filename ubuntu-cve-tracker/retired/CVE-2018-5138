Description:
 A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a malicious site with an extremely
 long domain name is opened in an Android Custom Tab (a browser panel inside
 another app) and the default browser is Firefox for Android. This could
 allow an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use. Note:
 this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions and operating
 systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
