 An issue was discovered in xrdp before 0.9.1. When successfully logging in
 using RDP into an xrdp session, the file ~/.vnc/sesman_${username}_passwd
 is created. Its content is the equivalent of the user's cleartext password,
 DES encrypted with a known key.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that xrdp used a known key to store session passwords
 in text files. An attacker could potentially decrypt the file to obtain a
 user password.
