Description:
 In Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, no localized messages are
 shipped with the installer. As a consequence, Git is expected not to
 localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However,
 due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function's implicit
 initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded
 path `C:\mingw64\share\locale` to look for localized messages. And since
 any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\` (and
 since `C:\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for
 low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe`
 will pick them up in version 2.40.1.
 
 This vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social
 engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could
 be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a
 malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git
 and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker,
 though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains
 a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a
 Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a
 `C:\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative
 rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\`.
