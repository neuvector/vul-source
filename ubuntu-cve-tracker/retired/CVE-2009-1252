Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the crypto_recv function in ntp_crypto.c in
 ntpd in NTP before 4.2.4p7 and 4.2.5 before 4.2.5p74, when OpenSSL and
 autokey are enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 a crafted packet containing an extension field.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> from CERT: If autokey is enabled (the ntp.conf file contains the line           "crypto pw whatever" a remote attacker can send a carefully crafted             packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow for               malicious code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd              process.
