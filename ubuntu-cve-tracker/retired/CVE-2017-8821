Description:
 In Tor before 0.2.5.16, 0.2.6 through 0.2.8 before 0.2.8.17, 0.2.9 before
 0.2.9.14, 0.3.0 before 0.3.0.13, and 0.3.1 before 0.3.1.9, an attacker can
 cause a denial of service (application hang) via crafted PEM input that
 signifies a public key requiring a password, which triggers an attempt by
 the OpenSSL library to ask the user for the password, aka TROVE-2017-011.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Tor incorrectly handled PEM input. An attacker
 could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.
