Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being
 derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent
 to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of
 the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented).
 A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite
 arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation
 (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for
 example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> openssh-ssh1 is only provided for compatibility with old devices
 mdeslaur> that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. We will not be
 mdeslaur> providing any security support for the openssh-ssh1 package as
 mdeslaur> it is insecure and should be used in trusted environments only.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
 mdeslaur> sftp instead of scp.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The initial USN was incomplete and did not include the second
 mdeslaur> commit.
