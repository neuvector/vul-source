Description:
 Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A use-after-free was found
 in Vim < 9.1.0764. When closing a buffer (visible in a window) a
 BufWinLeave auto command can cause an use-after-free if this auto command
 happens to re-open the same buffer in a new split window. Impact is low
 since the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto command
 and run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. This
 issue has been addressed in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised to
 upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
