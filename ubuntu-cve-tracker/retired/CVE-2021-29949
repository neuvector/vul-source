Description:
 When loading the shared library that provides the OTR protocol
 implementation, Thunderbird will initially attempt to open it using a
 filename that isn't distributed by Thunderbird. If a computer has already
 been infected with a malicious library of the alternative filename, and the
 malicious library has been copied to a directory that is contained in the
 search path for executable libraries, then Thunderbird will load the
 incorrect library. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.
