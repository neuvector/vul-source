Description:
 The implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x
 through 2.8 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of
 observable timing differences and cache access patterns when Brainpool
 curves are used. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a
 side-channel attack that can be used for full password recovery.
