Description:
 On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library
 was disclosed: A vulnerability in the DMG file parser of ClamAV versions
 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow
 an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an
 affected device. This vulnerability is due to enabling XML entity
 substitution that may result in XML external entity injection. An attacker
 could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted DMG file to be
 scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
 the attacker to leak bytes from any file that may be read by the ClamAV
 scanning process.
