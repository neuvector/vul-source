Description:
 On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library
 was disclosed:
     A vulnerability in the DMG file parser of ClamAV versions 1.0.0 and
 earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an
 affected device.
     This vulnerability is due to enabling XML entity substitution that may
 result in XML external entity injection. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability by submitting a crafted DMG file to be scanned by ClamAV on
 an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to leak
 bytes from any file that may be read by the ClamAV scanning process.
