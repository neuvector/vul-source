Description:
 TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Versions
 prior to 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 are subject to Sensitive
 Information Disclosure. Due to the lack of handling user-submitted YAML
 placeholder expressions in the site configuration backend module, attackers
 could expose sensitive internal information, such as system configuration
 or HTTP request messages of other website visitors. A valid backend user
 account having administrator privileges is needed to exploit this
 vulnerability. This issue has been patched in versions 9.5.38 ELTS,
 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.
