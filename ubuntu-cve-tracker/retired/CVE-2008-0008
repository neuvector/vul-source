Description:
 The pa_drop_root function in PulseAudio 0.9.8, and a certain 0.9.9 build,
 does not check return values from (1) setresuid, (2) setreuid, (3) setuid,
 and (4) seteuid calls when attempting to drop privileges, which might allow
 local users to gain privileges by causing those calls to fail via attacks
 such as resource exhaustion.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> not possible to exploit in default installation. In fact, need an
   LSM to fail the call and then not protect the binary properly, so this is
   almost a non-issue on Ubuntu
