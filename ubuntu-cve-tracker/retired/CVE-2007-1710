Description:
 The readfile function in PHP 4.4.4, 5.1.6, and 5.2.1 allows
 context-dependent attackers to bypass safe_mode restrictions and read
 arbitrary files by referring to local files with a certain URL syntax
 instead of a pathname syntax, as demonstrated by a filename preceded a
 "php://../../" sequence.
