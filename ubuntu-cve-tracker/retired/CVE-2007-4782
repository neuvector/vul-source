Description:
 PHP before 5.2.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) via (1) a long string in the pattern parameter
 to the glob function; or (2) a long string in the string parameter to the
 fnmatch function, accompanied by a pattern parameter value with undefined
 characteristics, as demonstrated by a "*[1]e" value.  NOTE: this might not
 be a vulnerability in most web server environments that support multiple
 threads, unless these issues can be demonstrated for code execution.
