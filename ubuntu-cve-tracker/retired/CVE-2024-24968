Description:
 Improper finite state machines (FSMs) in hardware logic in some Intel(R)
 Processors may allow an privileged user to potentially enable a denial of
 service via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly implement
 finite state machines (FSMs) in hardware logic. This may allow a local
 privileged attacker to cause a denial of service (system crash).
