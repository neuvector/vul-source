Description:
 An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through
 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal
 to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to
 its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems
 that support "saved UID" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An
 attacker with command execution in the shell can use "enable -f" for
 runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls
 setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with
 an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> This issue appears to only affect bash when bash is
   setuid. Ubuntu does not ship with bash setuid, so this has minimal
   impact for Ubuntu users. This is why we have rated the priority
   for this issue 'low'.
