Description:
 OpenPrinting CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system for
 Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Starting in version 2.0.0 and
 prior to version 2.4.6, CUPS logs data of free memory to the logging
 service AFTER the connection has been closed, when it should have logged
 the data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire
 cupsd process.
 
 The exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con->http)` being
 called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always,
 provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the
 call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This
 issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher
 and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address
 (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or
 if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by
 rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.
 
 Version 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.
