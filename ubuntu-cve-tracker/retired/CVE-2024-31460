Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
 Prior to version 1.2.27, some of the data stored in
 `automation_tree_rules.php` is not thoroughly checked and is used to
 concatenate the SQL statement in `create_all_header_nodes()` function from
 `lib/api_automation.php` , finally resulting in SQL injection. Using SQL
 based secondary injection technology, attackers can modify the contents of
 the Cacti database, and based on the modified content, it may be possible
 to achieve further impact, such as arbitrary file reading, and even remote
 code execution through arbitrary file writing. Version 1.2.27 contains a
 patch for the issue.
