Description:
 Memory leak in the VFS file lease handling in locks.c in Linux kernels
 2.6.10 to 2.6.15 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory
 exhaustion) via certain Samba activities that cause an fasync entry to be
 re-allocated by the fcntl_setlease function after the fasync queue has
 already been cleaned by the locks_delete_lock function.
