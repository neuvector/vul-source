Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect
 input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in
 Denial of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to
 this vulnerability occurring before normal security checks; any remote
 client that can reach the proxy port can trivially perform the attack via a
 crafted URI scheme.
