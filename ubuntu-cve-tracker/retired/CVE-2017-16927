Description:
 The scp_v0s_accept function in sesman/libscp/libscp_v0.c in the session
 manager in xrdp through 0.9.4 uses an untrusted integer as a write length,
 which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 input stream.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that xrdp could be made to overflow a buffer and crash.
