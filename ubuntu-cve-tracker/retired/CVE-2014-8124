Description:
 OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) before 2014.1.3 and 2014.2.x before 2014.2.1
 does not properly handle session records when using a db or memcached
 session engine, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 via a large number of requests to the login page.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> the fix for CVE-2014-8124 introduced a regression, which is
 mdeslaur> fixed here:
 mdeslaur> https://review.openstack.org/#/c/142737/
 seth-arnold> The python-django-openstack-auth regression fix is currently only
  included in the wily package (2015-5-14) -- however, no one has complained
  and testing hasn't demonstrated any problems.
 seth-arnold> horizon in precise does not appear to take the operations that auto-
  instantiated django sessions in the newer releases; it looks safe.
