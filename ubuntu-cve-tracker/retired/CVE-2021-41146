Description:
 qutebrowser is an open source keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI.
 Starting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for qutebrowser
 registers a `qutebrowserurl:` URL handler. With certain applications,
 opening a specially crafted `qutebrowserurl:...` URL can lead to execution
 of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows arbitrary code execution via
 commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-pyeval`. Only Windows installs where
 qutebrowser is registered as URL handler are affected. The issue has been
 fixed in qutebrowser v2.4.0. The fix also adds additional hardening for
 potential similar issues on Linux (by adding the new --untrusted-args flag
 to the .desktop file), though no such vulnerabilities are known.
