Description:
 A flaw was found in rsync. When using the `--safe-links` option, the rsync
 client fails to properly verify if a symbolic link destination sent from
 the server contains another symbolic link within it. This results in a path
 traversal vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary file write outside the
 desired directory.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Affected function unsafe_symlink() is in rsync in all Ubuntu
  releases so assuming all are affected since this function hasn't changed
  upstream in the last 16 years
