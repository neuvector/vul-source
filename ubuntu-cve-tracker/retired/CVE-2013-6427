Description:
 upgrade.py in the hp-upgrade service in HP Linux Imaging and Printing
 (HPLIP) 3.x through 3.13.11 launches a program from an http URL, which
 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code by gaining
 control over the client-server data stream.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Precise and earlier don't have the upgrade.py file.
 mdeslaur> In Quantal, Raring, Saucy and Trusty, upgrade.py actually bails
 mdeslaur> out because the specific ubuntu version isn't marked as
 mdeslaur> "supported" in distros.dat, so even if this script is run as
 mdeslaur> root, it doesn't do anything, thankfully.
