Description:
 GIMP PSP File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
 affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is required to exploit
 this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
 malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PSP files.
 The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
 which can result in an integer overflow before writing to memory. An
 attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of
 the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22096.
