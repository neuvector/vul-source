Description:
 Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) files can specify a JavaScript function called for
 all URL requests with the full URL path which exposes more information than
 would be sent to the proxy itself in the case of HTTPS. Normally the Proxy
 Auto-Config file is specified by the user or machine owner and presumed to
 be non-malicious, but if a user has enabled Web Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD)
 this file can be served remotely. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 51.
