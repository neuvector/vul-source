Description:
 Buffer overflow in the set_page_size function in util.cxx in HTMLDOC 1.8.27
 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code
 via a long MEDIA SIZE comment.  NOTE: it was later reported that there were
 additional vectors in htmllib.cxx and ps-pdf.cxx using an AFM font file
 with a long glyph name, but these vectors do not cross privilege
 boundaries.
