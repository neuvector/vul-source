Description:
 Moodle 1.5.2 and earlier stores sensitive information under the web root
 with insufficient access control, and provides directory listings, which
 allows remote attackers to obtain user names, password hashes, and other
 sensitive information via a direct request for session (sess_*) files in
 moodledata/sessions/.
