Description:
 A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebGL operations. While
 this results in a potentially exploitable crash, the vulnerability is
 limited because the memory is freed and reused in a brief window of time
 during the freeing of the same callstack. This vulnerability affects
 Firefox < 60.
