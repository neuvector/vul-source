Description:
 It was found that polkit could be tricked into bypassing the credential
 checks for D-Bus requests, elevating the privileges of the requestor to the
 root user. This flaw could be used by an unprivileged local attacker to,
 for example, create a new local administrator. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
 availability.
