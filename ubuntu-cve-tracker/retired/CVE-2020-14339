Description:
 A flaw was found in libvirt, where it leaked a file descriptor for
 `/dev/mapper/control` into the QEMU process. This file descriptor allows
 for privileged operations to happen against the device-mapper on the host.
 This flaw allows a malicious guest user or process to perform operations
 outside of their standard permissions, potentially causing serious damage
 to the host operating system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
 to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
