Description:
 Evolution 2.8.1 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument
 when invoking GnuPG, which prevents Evolution from visually distinguishing
 between signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple
 components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a
 message without detection.
