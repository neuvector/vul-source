Description:
 Double free vulnerability in the ssl3_get_key_exchange function in the
 OpenSSL client (ssl/s3_clnt.c) in OpenSSL 1.0.0a, 0.9.8, 0.9.7, and
 possibly other versions, when using ECDH, allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted private key with an invalid prime.  NOTE: some
 sources refer to this as a use-after-free issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
  sbeattie> possibly stopped by glibc's double-free heap protection,
  sbeattie> CVE asserts that it's needed in 0.9.7, though the referenced
    email from solar designer claims that it's not needed in 0.9.7 as
    ECDH hadn't been introduced yet as of openssl 0.9.7m.
