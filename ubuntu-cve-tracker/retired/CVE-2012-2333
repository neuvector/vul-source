Description:
 Integer underflow in OpenSSL before 0.9.8x, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0j, and 1.0.1
 before 1.0.1c, when TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, or DTLS is used with CBC encryption,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TLS packet that is not
 properly handled during a certain explicit IV calculation.
