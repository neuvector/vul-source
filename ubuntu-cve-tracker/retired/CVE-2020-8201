Description:
 Node.js < 12.18.4 and < 14.11 can be exploited to perform HTTP desync
 attacks and deliver malicious payloads to unsuspecting users. The payloads
 can be crafted by an attacker to hijack user sessions, poison cookies,
 perform clickjacking, and a multitude of other attacks depending on the
 architecture of the underlying system. The attack was possible due to a bug
 in processing of carrier-return symbols in the HTTP header names.
