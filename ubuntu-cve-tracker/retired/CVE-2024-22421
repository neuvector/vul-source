Description:
 JupyterLab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible
 computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. Users of
 JupyterLab who click on a malicious link may get their `Authorization` and
 `XSRFToken` tokens exposed to a third party when running an older
 `jupyter-server` version. JupyterLab versions 4.1.0b2, 4.0.11, and 3.6.7
 are patched. No workaround has been identified, however users should ensure
 to upgrade `jupyter-server` to version 2.7.2 or newer which includes a
 redirect vulnerability fix.
