Description:
 The msn_httpconn_parse_data function in httpconn.c in the MSN protocol
 plugin in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.0 does not properly handle HTTP
 100 responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (incorrect memory access and application crash) via vectors involving a
 crafted server message.
