Description:
 Mutt does not verify that the smtps server hostname matches the domain name
 of the subject of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to spoof an SSL SMTP server via an arbitrary certificate, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2009-3766.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> debian may have used an incomplete patch from the upstream
 mdeslaur> bug.
 tyhicks> This is not specific to SMTPS. It is in the common code that
 tyhicks> uses GnuTLS, meaning that the IMAPS and POP3S protocols are also
 tyhicks> affected.
 tyhicks> Debian is carrying a fix that upstream has not applied. It doesn't
 tyhicks> look like this issue is fixed upstream. RHEL is also carrying the
 tyhicks> same fix.
 tyhicks> The fix may be the cause of a mutt sidebar related bug (a feature
 tyhicks> patch that debian and ubuntu carry)
 tyhicks> After more investigation, the sidebar related bug was preexisting.
 tyhicks> Hardy's version of mutt has a considerably different
 tyhicks> mutt_ssl_gnutls.c and my testing has shown that it is not affected.
