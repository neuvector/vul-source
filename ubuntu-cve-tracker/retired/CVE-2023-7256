Description:
 In affected libpcap versions during the setup of a remote packet capture
 the internal function sock_initaddress() calls getaddrinfo() and possibly
 freeaddrinfo(), but does not clearly indicate to the caller function
 whether freeaddrinfo() still remains to be called after the function
 returns.  This makes it possible in some scenarios that both the function
 and its caller call freeaddrinfo() for the same allocated memory block.  A
 similar problem was reported in Apple libpcap, to which Apple assigned
 CVE-2023-40400.
