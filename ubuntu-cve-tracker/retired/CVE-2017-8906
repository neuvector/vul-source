 https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git/issues/345/integer-underflow-in-x265-source-common
Description:
 An integer underflow vulnerability exists in pixel-a.asm, the x86 assembly
 code for planeClipAndMax() in MulticoreWare x265 through 2.4, as used by
 the x265_encoder_encode dependency in libbpg and other products. A small
 picture can cause an integer underflow, which leads to a Denial of Service
 in the process of encoding.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 msalvatore> Affected code is *NOT* disabled in xenial. Xenial is affected.
 msalvatore> Upstream has not released a patch, rather, they have "disabled
 msalvatore> 'planeClipAndMax' assembly primitives"
 ccdm94> it seems like upstream has already closed this issue and will be
 ccdm94> providing a fix for it other than the suggested disabling of the
 ccdm94> 'planeClipAndMax' assembly primitives. Therefore, considering that
 ccdm94> this has been deferred for 5+ years and there were no further
 ccdm94> changes that allow this to be patched in xenial, xenial will be
 ccdm94> marked as ignored.
