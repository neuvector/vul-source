Description:
 Git is an open-source distributed revision control system. In affected
 versions of Git a specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links
 as well as files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause
 just-checked out script to be executed while cloning onto a
 case-insensitive file system such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default
 file systems on Windows and macOS). Note that clean/smudge filters have to
 be configured for that. Git for Windows configures Git LFS by default, and
 is therefore vulnerable. The problem has been patched in the versions
 published on Tuesday, March 9th, 2021. As a workaound, if symbolic link
 support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks
 false`), the described attack won't work. Likewise, if no clean/smudge
 filters such as Git LFS are configured globally (i.e. _before_ cloning),
 the attack is foiled. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories
 from untrusted sources. The earliest impacted version is 2.14.2. The fix
 versions are: 2.30.1, 2.29.3, 2.28.1, 2.27.1, 2.26.3, 2.25.5, 2.24.4,
 2.23.4, 2.22.5, 2.21.4, 2.20.5, 2.19.6, 2.18.5, 2.17.62.17.6.
