Description:
 Buffer overflow in yaSSL, as used in MySQL 5.5.20 and possibly other
 versions including 5.5.x before 5.5.22 and 5.1.x before 5.1.62, allows
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, as
 demonstrated by VulnDisco Pack Professional 9.17.  NOTE: as of 20120224,
 this disclosure has no actionable information. However, because the module
 author is a reliable researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE
 identifier for tracking purposes.  NOTE: due to lack of details, it is not
 clear whether this issue is a duplicate of CVE-2012-0492 or another CVE.
