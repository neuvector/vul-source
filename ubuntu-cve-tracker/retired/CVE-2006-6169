Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the ask_outfile_name function in openfile.c
 for GnuPG (gpg) 1.4 and 2.0, when running interactively, might allow
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via messages with "C-escape"
 expansions, which cause the make_printable_string function to return a
 longer string than expected while constructing a prompt.
