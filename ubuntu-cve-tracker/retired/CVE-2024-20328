Description:
 A vulnerability in the VirusEvent feature of ClamAV could allow a local
 attacker to inject arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
 application service account.The vulnerability is due to unsafe handling of
 file names. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying
 a file name containing command-line sequences. When processed on a system
 using configuration options for the VirusEvent feature, the attacker could
 cause the application to execute arbitrary commands. ClamAV has released
 software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds
 that address this vulnerability.
