Description:
 The pnm_get_chunk function in xine 0.99.2 and earlier, and other packages
 such as MPlayer that use the same code, does not properly verify that the
 chunk size is less than the PREAMBLE_SIZE, which causes a read operation
 with a negative length that leads to a buffer overflow via (1) RMF_TAG, (2)
 DATA_TAG, (3) PROP_TAG, (4) MDPR_TAG, and (5) CONT_TAG values, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2004-1187.
