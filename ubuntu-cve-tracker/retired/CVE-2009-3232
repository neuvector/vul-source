Description:
 pam-auth-update for PAM, as used in Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.4, and Debian
 GNU/Linux, does not properly handle an "empty selection" for system
 authentication modules in certain rare configurations, which causes any
 attempt to be successful and allows remote attackers to bypass
 authentication.
