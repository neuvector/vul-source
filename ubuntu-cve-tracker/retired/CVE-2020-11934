Description:
 It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the
 $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable when calling the system xdg-open.
 OpenURL() in usersession/userd/launcher.go would alter $XDG_DATA_DIRS to
 append a path to a directory controlled by the calling snap. A malicious
 snap could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to control
 how the host system xdg-open script opens the URL and, for example, execute
 a script shipped with the snap without confinement. This issue did not
 affect Ubuntu Core systems. Fixed in snapd versions 2.45.1ubuntu0.2,
 2.45.1+18.04.2 and 2.45.1+20.04.2.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the $XDG_DATA_DIRS
 environment variable when calling the system xdg-open. A malicious snap 
 could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to control how 
 the host system xdg-open script opens the URL. This issue did not affect
 Ubuntu Core systems. (CVE-2020-11934)
Notes:
 emitorino> Since the vulnerability is present on the userd's OpenURL
  implementation, it only affects classic distros where userd is 
  auto-started.
 emitorino> Since userd cannot be auto-started on Ubuntu Core 16, Ubuntu 
  Core 18 or Ubuntu Core 20 (for various reasons depending on the 
  release), then Ubuntu Core is not affected.
 emitorino> Even if userd happened to start (eg, the user started it 
  manually on UC20) there is no implicitOnCore policy that allows 
  communicating with io.snapcraft.Launcher (or the older 
  com.canonical.SafeLauncher).
 emitorino> The dbus interface can't be used (with either plugs or slots)
  to communicate with userd.
 emitorino> /usr/bin/xdg-open on the boot file system of an Ubuntu Core 
  system is different to Classic: it is the sandbox proxy that calls back
  into userd. Even if a session bus is running and a confined app could 
  call userd, userd will report an error because the caller is not confined
