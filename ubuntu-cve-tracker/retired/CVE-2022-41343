Description:
 registerFont in FontMetrics.php in Dompdf before 2.0.1 allows remote file
 inclusion because a URI validation failure does not halt font registration,
 as demonstrated by a @font-face rule.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> the code is not present in version 0.6.2, even though there is a
 ccdm94> register_font function in include/font_metrics.cls.php which seems
 ccdm94> to contain similar code as the registerFont function being patched
 ccdm94> in the fix commit.
