Description:
 curl < 7.84.0 supports "chained" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that
 a serverresponse can be compressed multiple times and potentially with
 different algorithms. The number of acceptable "links" in this
 "decompression chain" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert
 a virtually unlimited number of compression steps.The use of such a
 decompression chain could result in a "malloc bomb", makingcurl end up
 spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying toand
 returning out of memory errors.
