Description:
 Vim is an open source command line text editor. Vim < v9.1.0647 has double
 free in src/alloc.c:616. When closing a window, the corresponding tagstack
 data will be cleared and freed. However a bit later, the quickfix list
 belonging to that window will also be cleared and if that quickfix list
 points to the same tagstack data, Vim will try to free it again, resulting
 in a double-free/use-after-free access exception. Impact is low since the
 user must intentionally execute vim with several non-default flags,
 but it may cause a crash of Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch
 v9.1.0647
