Description:
 PyCryptodome and pycryptodomex before 3.19.1 allow side-channel leakage for
 OAEP decryption, exploitable for a Manger attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and older contain a substantially older
 mdeslaur> codebase which would require major intrusive changes to
 mdeslaur> remediate all side-channel attacks. Due to the high risk of
 mdeslaur> regressions, we will not be fixing this issue in focal and
 mdeslaur> older. If this issue is critical in your environment, we
 mdeslaur> recommend migrating to a more recent version of Ubuntu.
