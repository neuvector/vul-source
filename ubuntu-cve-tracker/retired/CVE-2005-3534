Description:
 Buffer overflow in the Network Block Device (nbd) server 2.7.5 and earlier,
 and 2.8.0 through 2.8.2, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
 via a large request, which is written past the end of the buffer because
 nbd does not account for memory taken by the reply header.
