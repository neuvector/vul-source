Description:
 In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before
 8.3.8, the fix for CVE-2024-1874 does not work if the command name includes
 trailing spaces. Original issue: when using proc_open() command with array
 syntax, due to insufficient escaping, if the arguments of the executed
 command are controlled by a malicious user, the user can supply arguments
 that would execute arbitrary commands in Windows shell.
