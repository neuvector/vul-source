Description:
 A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists in
 curl <v7.88.0 that could cause HSTS functionality fail when multiple URLs
 are requested serially. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to
 use HTTPS instead of usingan insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP
 is provided in the URL. ThisHSTS mechanism would however surprisingly be
 ignored by subsequent transferswhen done on the same command line because
 the state would not be properlycarried on.
