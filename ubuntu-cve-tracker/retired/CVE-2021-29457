Description:
 Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
 deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A heap buffer overflow
 was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The heap overflow is
 triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.
 An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code
 execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted
 image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the
 metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_
 the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line
 application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as
 `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.
