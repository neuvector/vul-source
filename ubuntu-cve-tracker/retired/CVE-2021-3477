Description:
 There's a flaw in OpenEXR's deep tile sample size calculations in versions
 before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to be
 processed by OpenEXR could trigger an integer overflow, subsequently
 leading to an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk of this flaw is to
 application availability.
