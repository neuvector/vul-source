Description:
 ircu 2.10.12.03 and 2.10.12.04 does not associate a timestamp with ops
 privilege on an unused channel (zannel), which allows remote attackers to
 (1) set or remove certain channel modes via a "netriding" attack or (2)
 take over a channel by joining an unlinked server with the A/Upass and then
 setting a new Apass.
