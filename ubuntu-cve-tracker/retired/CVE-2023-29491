Description:
 ncurses before 6.4 20230408, when used by a setuid application, allows
 local users to trigger security-relevant memory corruption via malformed
 data in a terminfo database file that is found in $HOME/.terminfo or
 reached via the TERMINFO or TERM environment variable.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> upstream commit has miscellaneous changes besides the
   security fix.
 mdeslaur> TODO: investigate why ncurses is built without
 mdeslaur> "with_root_environ=no" build option, that should be the default
 mdeslaur> going forward to prevent these types of issues.
 ccdm94> applying the upstream patch of ncurses that fixes this issue to
 ccdm94> focal and earlier would have been too intrusive, since changes
 ccdm94> such as the various made by commit 790a85db were not present in
 ccdm94> their versions of this package. Setting the
 ccdm94> --disable-root-environ option with a few additional changes to
 ccdm94> the code (as done by Debian in version 6.4-3 of the package)
 ccdm94> allows us to mitigate this issue and avoid other issues that
 ccdm94> involve the possibility of malicious use of environment
 ccdm94> variables through setuid applications, and, therefore, it was
 ccdm94> the fix chosen in order to resolve this vulnerability.
