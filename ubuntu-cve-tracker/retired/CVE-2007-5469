Description:
 OpenSER 1.2.2 does not verify the Digest authentication header URI against
 the Request URI in SIP messages, which allows remote attackers to use
 sniffed Digest authentication credentials to call arbitrary telephone
 numbers or spoof caller ID (aka "toll fraud and authentication forward
 attack").  NOTE: Debian disputes this issue, stating that "having the two
 URIs mismatch is allowed by the standard and happens in some setups for
 valid reasons.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> I agree with Debian for this.
