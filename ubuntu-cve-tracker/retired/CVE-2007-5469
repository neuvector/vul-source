Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  OpenSER 1.2.2 does not verify the Digest authentication
 header URI against the Request URI in SIP messages, which allows remote
 attackers to use sniffed Digest authentication credentials to call
 arbitrary telephone numbers or spoof caller ID (aka "toll fraud and
 authentication forward attack").  NOTE: Debian disputes this issue, stating
 that "having the two URIs mismatch is allowed by the standard and happens
 in some setups for valid reasons."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> I agree with Debian for this.
