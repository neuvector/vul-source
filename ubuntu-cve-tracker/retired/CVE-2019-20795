Description:
 iproute2 before 5.1.0 has a use-after-free in get_netnsid_from_name in
 ip/ipnetns.c. NOTE: security relevance may be limited to certain uses of
 setuid that, although not a default, are sometimes a configuration option
 offered to end users. Even when setuid is used, other factors (such as C
 library configuration) may block exploitability.
