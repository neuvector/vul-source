Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In KeePassXC through 2.7.5, a local attacker can make
 changes to the Database security settings, including master password and
 second-factor authentication, within an authenticated KeePassXC Database
 session, without the need to authenticate these changes by entering the
 password and/or second-factor authentication to confirm changes. NOTE: the
 vendor's position is "asking the user for their password prior to making
 any changes to the database settings adds no additional protection against
 a local attacker."
