Description:
 sudo_noexec.so in Sudo before 1.8.15 on Linux might allow local users to
 bypass intended noexec command restrictions via an application that calls
 the (1) system or (2) popen function.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> I'm marking this negligible because this feature seems doomed
  to failure in the general case. Any sort of memory-protection flaws
  in the target process, or ability to execute system calls directly,
  or programs that don't use the standard C libraries, etc. won't be
  affected by this feature.
 seth-arnold> If you rely upon this feature I suggest instead seccomp2-based
  filters to disable the execve() and execveat() system calls at the
  kernel interface or AppArmor (or other MAC system) to restrict which
  executables can be executed.
