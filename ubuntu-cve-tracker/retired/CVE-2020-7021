Description:
 Elasticsearch versions before 7.10.0 and 6.8.14 have an information
 disclosure issue when audit logging and the emit_request_body option is
 enabled. The Elasticsearch audit log could contain sensitive information
 such as password hashes or authentication tokens. This could allow an
 Elasticsearch administrator to view these details.
