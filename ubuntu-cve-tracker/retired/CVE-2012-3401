Description:
 The t2p_read_tiff_init function in tiff2pdf (tools/tiff2pdf.c) in LibTIFF
 4.0.2 and earlier does not properly initialize the T2P context struct
 pointer in certain error conditions, which allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image that triggers a heap-based buffer
 overflow.

Notes:
