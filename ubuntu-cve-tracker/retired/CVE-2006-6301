Description:
 DenyHosts 2.5 does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows remote
 attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file and cause a
 denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the sshd log file, as
 demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a login name containing certain
 strings with an IP address, which is not properly handled by a regular
 expression.
