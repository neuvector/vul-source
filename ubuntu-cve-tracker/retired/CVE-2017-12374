Description:
 The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a
 vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
 a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
 vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms
 during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations on bounce
 messages). If successfully exploited, the ClamAV software could allow a
 variable pointing to the mail body which could cause a used after being
 free (use-after-free) instance which may lead to a disruption of services
 on an affected device to include a denial of service condition.
