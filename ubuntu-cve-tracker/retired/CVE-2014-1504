Description:
 The session-restore feature in Mozilla Firefox before 28.0 and SeaMonkey
 before 2.25 does not consider the Content Security Policy of a data: URL,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
 (XSS) attacks via a crafted document that is accessed after a browser
 restart.
