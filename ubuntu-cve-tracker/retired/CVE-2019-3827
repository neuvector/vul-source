Description:
 An incorrect permission check in the admin backend in gvfs before version
 1.39.4 was found that allows reading and modify arbitrary files by
 privileged users without asking for password when no authentication agent
 is running. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious programs
 running under privileges of users belonging to the wheel group to further
 escalate its privileges by modifying system files without user's knowledge.
 Successful exploitation requires uncommon system configuration.
