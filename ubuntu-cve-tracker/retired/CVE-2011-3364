Description:
 Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in the svEscape function in
 settings/plugins/ifcfg-rh/shvar.c in the ifcfg-rh plug-in for GNOME
 NetworkManager 0.9.1, 0.9.0, 0.8.1, and possibly other versions, when
 PolicyKit is configured to allow users to create new connections, allows
 local users to execute arbitrary commands via a newline character in the
 name for a new network connection, which is not properly handled when
 writing to the ifcfg file.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> This is for the redhat-specific plugin, but we need to check
 mdeslaur> if the debian plugin has the same flaw, as it may be based on
 mdeslaur> the same code
 mdeslaur> We don't look vulnerable to this, and embedded newline chars
 mdeslaur> seem to be handled correctly.
