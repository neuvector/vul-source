Description:
 The Debugger extension API in
 browser/extensions/api/debugger/debugger_api.cc in Google Chrome before
 37.0.2062.94 does not validate a tab's URL before an attach operation,
 which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access limitations via an
 extension that uses a restricted URL, as demonstrated by a chrome:// URL.
