Description:
 Exim NTLM Challenge Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose
 sensitive information on affected installations of Exim. Authentication is
 not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within
 the handling of NTLM challenge requests. The issue results from the lack of
 proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past
 the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this
 vulnerability to disclose information in the context of the service
 account. Was ZDI-CAN-17433.
