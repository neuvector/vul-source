Description:
 During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the
 Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly
 input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform
 electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the
 recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does
 not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products
 built on top of it might. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 78.
