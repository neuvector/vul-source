 https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v9.1.0038
Description:
 Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Patch v9.1.0038 optimized
 how the cursor position is calculated and removed a loop, that verified
 that the cursor position always points inside a line and does not become
 invalid by pointing beyond the end of
 a line. Back then we assumed this loop is unnecessary. However, this change
 made it possible that the cursor position stays invalid and points beyond
 the end of a line, which would eventually cause a heap-buffer-overflow when
 trying to access the line pointer at
 the specified cursor position. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to
 this situation that the cursor points to an invalid position. That's why
 patch v9.1.0707 does not include a test case. The only observed impact has
 been a program crash. This issue has been addressed in with the patch
 v9.1.0707. All users are advised to upgrade.
