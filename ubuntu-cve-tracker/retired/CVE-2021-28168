Description:
 Eclipse Jersey 2.28 to 2.33 and Eclipse Jersey 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 contains a
 local information disclosure vulnerability. This is due to the use of the
 File.createTempFile which creates a file inside of the system temporary
 directory with the permissions: -rw-r--r--. Thus the contents of this file
 are viewable by all other users locally on the system. As such, if the
 contents written is security sensitive, it can be disclosed to other local
 users.
