Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in MPlayer 1.0pre7try2 allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service and trigger heap-based buffer overflows via (1) a
 certain ASF file handled by asfheader.c that causes the asf_descrambling
 function to be passed a negative integer after the conversion from a char
 to an int or (2) an AVI file with a crafted wLongsPerEntry or nEntriesInUse
 value in the indx chunk, which is handled in aviheader.c.
