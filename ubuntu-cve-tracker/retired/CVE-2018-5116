Description:
 WebExtensions with the "ActiveTab" permission are able to access frames
 hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious
 extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page
 and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with
 this permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
