Description:
 OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has a buffer
 overflow in the cv::BmpDecoder::readData function in
 modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_bmp.cpp when reading an image file by using
 cv::imread, as demonstrated by the 4-buf-overflow-readData-memcpy test
 case.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenCV incorrectly handled certain image files.
 An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service,
 execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.
