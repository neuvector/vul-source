Description:
 dpkg 1.15.9 on Debian squeeze introduces support for the "C-style encoded
 filenames" feature without recognizing that the squeeze patch program lacks
 this feature, which triggers an interaction error that allows remote
 attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files outside
 of the intended directories via a crafted source package.  NOTE: this can
 be considered a release engineering problem in the effort to fix
 CVE-2014-0471.
