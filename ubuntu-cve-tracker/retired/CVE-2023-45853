Description:
 MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant
 heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename,
 comment, or extra field. NOTE: MiniZip is not a supported part of the zlib
 product. NOTE: pyminizip through 0.2.6 is also vulnerable because it
 bundles an affected zlib version, and exposes the applicable MiniZip code
 through its compress API.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> since 3.2.0-1, rsync builds with the system zlib
 mdeslaur> contrib/minizip is no longer built in zlib in xenial+
