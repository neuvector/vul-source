Description:
 OpenStack Keystone, as used in OpenStack Folsom before folsom-rc1 and
 OpenStack Essex (2012.1), allows remote attackers to add an arbitrary user
 to an arbitrary tenant via a request to update the user's default tenant to
 the administrative API. NOTE: this identifier was originally incorrectly
 assigned to an open redirect issue, but the correct identifier for that
 issue is CVE-2012-3540.
