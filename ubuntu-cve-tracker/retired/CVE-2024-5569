Description:
 A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the jaraco/zipp library,
 affecting all versions prior to 3.19.1. The vulnerability is triggered when
 processing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop.
 This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the
 third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected
 code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated
 through the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and
 zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and
 `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it
 prevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed
 in version 3.19.1 of jaraco/zipp.
