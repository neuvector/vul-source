Description:
 If a text string that happens to be a filename in the operating system's
 native format is dragged and dropped onto the addressbar the specified
 local file will be opened. This is contrary to policy and is what would
 happen if the string were the equivalent "file:" URL. This vulnerability
 affects Firefox < 60.
