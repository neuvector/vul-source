Description:
 File downloads encoded with "blob:" and "data:" URL elements bypassed
 normal file download checks though the Phishing and Malware Protection
 feature and its block lists of suspicious sites and files. This would allow
 malicious sites to lure users into downloading executables that would
 otherwise be detected as suspicious. This vulnerability affects Firefox <
 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.
