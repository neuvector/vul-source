Description:
 A path traversal vulnerability exists in curl <8.0.0 SFTP implementation
 causes the tilde (~) character to be wrongly replaced when used as a prefix
 in the first path element, in addition to its intended use as the first
 element to indicate a path relative to the user's home directory. Attackers
 can exploit this flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by
 crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a server with a specific user.
