Description:
 Incorrect default permissions in some Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor memory
 controller configurations when using Intel(R) SGX may allow a privileged
 user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Avraham Shalev and Nagaraju N Kodalapura discovered that some Intel(R)
 Xeon(R) processors did not properly restrict access to the memory
 controller when using Intel(R) SGX. This may allow a local privileged
 attacker to further escalate their privileges.
