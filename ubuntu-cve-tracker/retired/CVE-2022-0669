Description:
 A flaw was found in dpdk. This flaw allows a malicious vhost-user master to
 attach an unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to
 VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are
 not closed by the vhost-user slave. By sending such messages continuously,
 the vhost-user master exhausts available fd in the vhost-user slave
 process, leading to a denial of service.
