Description:
 In PHP versions 7.4.x below 7.4.28, 8.0.x below 8.0.16, and 8.1.x below
 8.1.3, when using filter functions with FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT filter and
 min/max limits, if the filter fails, there is a possibility to trigger use
 of allocated memory after free, which can result it crashes, and
 potentially in overwrite of other memory chunks and RCE. This issue
 affects: code that uses FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT with min/max limits.
