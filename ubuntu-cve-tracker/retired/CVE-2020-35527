Description:
 In SQLite 3.31.1, there is an out of bounds access problem through ALTER
 TABLE for views that have a nested FROM clause.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> upstream fix adds a check with the macro IN_RENAME_OBJECT,
 rodrigo-zaiden> that started to appear in version 3.25.0 (commit cf8f2895) as
 rodrigo-zaiden> IN_RENAME_COLUMN and ended up in its current state in version
 rodrigo-zaiden> 3.31.0 (commit e6dc1e5b). Backporting the fix to versions
 rodrigo-zaiden> prior to 3.31 seems too risky and would likely introduce
 rodrigo-zaiden> regressions. Also, there is a note in the upstream bug link
 rodrigo-zaiden> saying that the issue happens "due to the two-size lookaside
 rodrigo-zaiden> memory allocator added in version 3.31.0". So, sqlite3 for
 rodrigo-zaiden> Ubuntu releases earlier than focal won't be fixed.
 rodrigo-zaiden> sqlite source package does not have the vulnerable code.
