Description:
 Wasmtime is a standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, using
 Cranelift. There is a use after free vulnerability in Wasmtime when both
 running Wasm that uses externrefs and enabling epoch interruption in
 Wasmtime. If you are not explicitly enabling epoch interruption (it is
 disabled by default) then you are not affected. If you are explicitly
 disabling the Wasm reference types proposal (it is enabled by default) then
 you are also not affected. The use after free is caused by Cranelift
 failing to emit stack maps when there are safepoints inside cold blocks.
 Cold blocks occur when epoch interruption is enabled. Cold blocks are
 emitted at the end of compiled functions, and change the order blocks are
 emitted versus defined. This reordering accidentally caused Cranelift to
 skip emitting some stack maps because it expected to emit the stack maps in
 block definition order, rather than block emission order. When Wasmtime
 would eventually collect garbage, it would fail to find live references on
 the stack because of the missing stack maps, think that they were
 unreferenced garbage, and therefore reclaim them. Then after the collection
 ended, the Wasm code could use the reclaimed-too-early references, which is
 a use after free. Patches have been released in versions 0.34.2 and 0.35.2,
 which fix the vulnerability. All Wasmtime users are recommended to upgrade
 to these patched versions. If upgrading is not an option for you at this
 time, you can avoid the vulnerability by either: disabling the Wasm
 reference types proposal, config.wasm_reference_types(false); or by
 disabling epoch interruption if you were previously enabling it.
 config.epoch_interruption(false).
