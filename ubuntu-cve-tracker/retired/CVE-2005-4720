Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 and earlier on Linux allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (client crash) via an IFRAME element with a large value
 of the WIDTH attribute, which triggers a problem related to representation
 of floating-point numbers, leading to an infinite loop of widget resizes
 and a corresponding large number of function calls on the stack.
