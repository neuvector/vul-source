Description:
 The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can
 allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. Bouncy
 Castle release 1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit
 HMAC instead. This applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47.
 For situations where people need to create the files for legacy reasons a
 specific keystore type "BKS-V1" was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted
 that the use of "BKS-V1" is discouraged by the library authors and should
 only be used where it is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a
 16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not going to cause a
 security issue in itself.
