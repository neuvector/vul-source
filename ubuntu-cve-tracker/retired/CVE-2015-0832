Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 36.0 does not properly recognize the equivalence of
 domain names with and without a trailing . (dot) character, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the HPKP and HSTS protection
 mechanisms by constructing a URL with this character and leveraging access
 to an X.509 certificate for a domain with this character.
