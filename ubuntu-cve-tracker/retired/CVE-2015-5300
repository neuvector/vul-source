Description:
 The panic_gate check in NTP before 4.2.8p5 is only re-enabled after the
 first change to the system clock that was greater than 128 milliseconds by
 default, which allows remote attackers to set NTP to an arbitrary time when
 started with the -g option, or to alter the time by up to 900 seconds
 otherwise by responding to an unspecified number of requests from trusted
 sources, and leveraging a resulting denial of service (abort and restart).
