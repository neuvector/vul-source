Description:
 The etcd package distributed with the Red Hat OpenStack platform has an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2023-39325/CVE-2023-44487, known as Rapid Reset.
 This issue occurs because the etcd package in the Red Hat OpenStack
 platform is using http://golang.org/x/net/http2 instead of the one provided
 by Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions, meaning it should be updated at
 compile time instead.
