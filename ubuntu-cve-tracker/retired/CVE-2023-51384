Description:
 In ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.6, certain destination constraints can be
 incompletely applied. When destination constraints are specified during
 addition of PKCS#11-hosted private keys, these constraints are only applied
 to the first key, even if a PKCS#11 token returns multiple keys.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> openssh-ssh1 is only provided for compatibility with old devices
 mdeslaur> that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. We will not be
 mdeslaur> providing any security support for the openssh-ssh1 package as
 mdeslaur> it is insecure and should be used in trusted environments only.
 mdeslaur> destination constraints were added in 8.9
