Description:
 Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
 deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A heap buffer overflow
 was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The heap overflow is
 triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.
 An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code
 execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted
 image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata,
 which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata.
 For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
 need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is
 fixed in version v0.27.4.
