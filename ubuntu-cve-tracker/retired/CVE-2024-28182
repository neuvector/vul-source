Description:
 nghttp2 is an implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2
 in C. The nghttp2 library prior to version 1.61.0 keeps reading the
 unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames even after a stream is reset
 to keep HPACK context in sync. This causes excessive CPU usage to decode
 HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates this vulnerability by limiting the
 number of CONTINUATION frames it accepts per stream. There is no workaround
 for this vulnerability.
