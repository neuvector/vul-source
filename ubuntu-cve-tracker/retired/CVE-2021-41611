Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 5.0.6 through 5.1.x before 5.2. When
 validating an origin server or peer certificate, Squid may incorrectly
 classify certain certificates as trusted. This problem allows a remote
 server to obtain security trust well improperly. This indication of trust
 may be passed along to clients, allowing access to unsafe or hijacked
 services.
