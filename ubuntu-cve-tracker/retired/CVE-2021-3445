Description:
 A flaw was found in libdnf's signature verification functionality in
 versions before 0.60.1. This flaw allows an attacker to achieve code
 execution if they can alter the header information of an RPM package and
 then trick a user or system into installing it. The highest risk of this
 vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system
 availability.
