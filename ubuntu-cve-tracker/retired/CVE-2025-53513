Description:
 The /charms endpoint on a Juju controller lacked sufficient authorization checks, 
 allowing any user with an account on the controller to upload a charm. Uploading
 a malicious charm that exploits a Zip Slip vulnerability could allow an attacker
 to gain access to a machine running a unit through the affected charm.
