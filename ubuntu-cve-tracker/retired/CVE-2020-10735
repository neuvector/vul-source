Description:
 A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity
 using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to
 parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float,
 decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32
 are not affected). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system
 availability.
Ubuntu-Description:
 To avoid backwards-incompatible changes Ubuntu Security will not apply
 Python’s CVE-2020-10735 bugfix. Ubuntu Security does not consider
 int<->str conversion a security issue in Python. Rather, developers may
 introduce Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities into their code by
 parsing unsanitized data with int<->str conversion. Developers using
 bignum integers are encouraged to consider specialized libraries, such
 as GMP. Using PyLong_FromString() in public APIs without an integer
 limit is strongly discouraged.
Notes:
 alexmurray| The upstream patch for this issue now limits the input string for
  int() to 5000 digits - this is a breaking change but very unlikely to
  cause a regression since it is highly unlikely there is code handling such
  large numbers since as noted in the upstream commit, "total amount of
  protons in the observable universe is known as Eddington number. That
  number has 80 digits." - so 5000 digits out to be enough for anyone
