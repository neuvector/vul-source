Description:
 Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function
 during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer
 dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the
 "signature_algorithms_cert" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid
 or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could
 be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL
 version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue
 did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g
 (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).
