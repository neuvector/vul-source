Description:
 When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so
 that they can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API. However, curl
 did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it would accept in a
 response, allowing a malicious server to stream an endless series of
 headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.
