Description: 
 libxml2, possibly before 2.5.0, does not properly detect recursion
 during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to
 cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted
 XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, aka
 the "billion laughs attack."
