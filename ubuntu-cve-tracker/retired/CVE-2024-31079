Description:
 When NGINX Plus or NGINX OSS are configured to use the HTTP/3 QUIC module,
 undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate
 or cause other potential impact. This attack requires that a request be
 specifically timed during the connection draining process, which the
 attacker has no visibility and limited influence over.
