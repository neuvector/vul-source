Description:
 OpenSSL before 0.9.8q, and 1.0.x before 1.0.0c, when
 SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG is enabled, does not properly
 prevent modification of the ciphersuite in the session cache, which allows
 remote attackers to force the downgrade to an unintended cipher via vectors
 involving sniffing network traffic to discover a session identifier.
