Description:
 The RAND_bytes function in libssh before 0.6.3, when forking is enabled,
 does not properly reset the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number
 generator (PRNG), which causes the state to be shared between children
 processes and allows local users to obtain sensitive information by
 leveraging a pid collision.
