Description:
 Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. In Redit 7.0 prior to
 7.0.12, extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in
 some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap
 memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Several
 scenarios that may lead to authenticated users executing a specially
 crafted `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS`and authenticated
 users who were set with ACL rules that match key names, executing a
 specially crafted command that refers to a variadic list of key names. The
 vulnerability is patched in Redis 7.0.12.
