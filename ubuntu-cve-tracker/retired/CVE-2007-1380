Description:
 The php_binary serialization handler in the session extension in PHP before
 4.4.5, and 5.x before 5.2.1, allows context-dependent attackers to obtain
 sensitive information (memory contents) via a serialized variable entry
 with a large length value, which triggers a buffer over-read.
