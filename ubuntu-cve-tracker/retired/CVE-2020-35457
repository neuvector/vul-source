Description:
 GNOME GLib before 2.65.3 has an integer overflow, that might lead to an
 out-of-bounds write, in g_option_group_add_entries. NOTE: the vendor's
 position is "Realistically this is not a security issue. The standard
 pattern is for callers to provide a static list of option entries in a
 fixed number of calls to g_option_group_add_entries()." The researcher
 states that this pattern is undocumented
