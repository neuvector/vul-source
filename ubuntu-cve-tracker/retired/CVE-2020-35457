Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** GNOME GLib before 2.65.3 has an integer overflow, that might
 lead to an out-of-bounds write, in g_option_group_add_entries. NOTE: the
 vendor's position is "Realistically this is not a security issue. The
 standard pattern is for callers to provide a static list of option entries
 in a fixed number of calls to g_option_group_add_entries()." The researcher
 states that this pattern is undocumented.
