Description:
 An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
 application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
 EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead
 to an application crash. This function can be called on public
 keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker
 to cause a denial of service attack.
 
 The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function
 but applications might call the function if there are additional
 security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.
