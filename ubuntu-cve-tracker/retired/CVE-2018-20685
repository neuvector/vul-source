Description:
 In OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client allows remote SSH servers to bypass
 intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename.
 The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the
 client side.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> openssh-ssh1 is only provided for compatibility with old devices
 mdeslaur> that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. We will not be
 mdeslaur> providing any security support for the openssh-ssh1 package as
 mdeslaur> it is insecure and should be used in trusted environments only.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
 mdeslaur> sftp instead of scp.
