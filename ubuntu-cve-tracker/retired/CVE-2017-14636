Description:
 Because of an integer overflow in sam2p 0.49.3, a loop executes 0xffffffff
 times, ending with an invalid read of size 1 in the Image::Indexed::sortPal
 function in image.cpp. However, this also causes memory corruption because
 of an attempted write to the invalid d[0xfffffffe] array element.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Sam2p incorrectly handled certain image files.
 An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service
 or other unspecified impact.
