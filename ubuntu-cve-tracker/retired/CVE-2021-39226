Description:
 Grafana is an open source data visualization platform. In affected versions
 unauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the snapshot with
 the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths:
 /dashboard/snapshot/:key, or /api/snapshots/:key. If the snapshot
 "public_mode" configuration setting is set to true (vs default of false),
 unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest
 database key by accessing the literal path:
 /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Regardless of the snapshot "public_mode"
 setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the
 lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, or
 /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. The combination of deletion and viewing
 enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting in
 complete snapshot data loss. This issue has been resolved in versions 8.1.6
 and 7.5.11. If for some reason you cannot upgrade you can use a reverse
 proxy or similar to block access to the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key,
 /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, /dashboard/snapshot/:key, and
 /api/snapshots/:key. They have no normal function and can be disabled
 without side effects.

Notes: 
 seth-arnold> I'm guessing https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/329f96db1a507378a5d8ba0de685a0f0ae3ce0e0
  is the fix, though nothing in the commit says that it is. Double-check.
  nic89> Grafana is only available as a package for Xenial, and it seems it
  nic89> was never maintained. All updates, including this CVE patch, are
  nic89> available via snaps.
Mitigation: 
 Block the following APIs with a reverse proxy:
    /api/snapshots/:key
    /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey
    /dashboard/snapshot/:key
    /api/snapshots/:key
