Description:
 OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other
 Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.12 and earlier, an unsafe
 deserialization and validation of printer attributes causes null
 dereference in the libcups library. This is a remote DoS vulnerability
 available in local subnet in default configurations. It can cause the cups
 & cups-browsed to crash, on all the machines in local network who are
 listening for printers (so by default for all regular linux machines). On
 systems where the vulnerability CVE-2024-47176 (cups-filters
 1.x/cups-browsed 2.x vulnerability) was not fixed, and the firewall on the
 machine does not reject incoming communication to IPP port, and the machine
 is set to be available to public internet, attack vector "Network" is
 possible. The current versions of CUPS and cups-browsed projects have the
 attack vector "Adjacent" in their default configurations. Version 2.4.13
 contains a patch for CVE-2025-58364.
