Description:
 debian/tor.init in the Debian tor_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was
 designed to execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the
 apparmor package is installed, but implements this incorrectly (with a
 wrong assumption that the specific pathname would remain the same forever),
 which allows attackers to bypass intended AppArmor restrictions by
 leveraging the silent loss of this protection mechanism. NOTE: this does
 not affect systems, such as default Debian stretch installations, on which
 Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead of this tor.init
 script).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Tor incorrectly implemented AppArmor restrictions. An
 attacker could possibly bypass those restrictions and cause an unspecified
 impact.
