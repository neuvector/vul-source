Description:
 The stream_reqbody_cl function in mod_proxy_http.c in the mod_proxy module
 in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.3.3, when a reverse proxy is configured,
 does not properly handle an amount of streamed data that exceeds the
 Content-Length value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (CPU consumption) via crafted requests.
