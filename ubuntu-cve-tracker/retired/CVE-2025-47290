Description:
 containerd is a container runtime. A time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU)
 vulnerability was found in containerd v2.1.0. While unpacking an image
 during an image pull, specially crafted container images could arbitrarily
 modify the host file system. The only affected version of containerd is
 2.1.0.  Other versions of containerd are not affected. This bug has been
 fixed in containerd 2.1.1. Users should update to this version to resolve
 the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and
 that only trusted users have permissions to import images.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Traditionally the containerd source package contained both the
 alexmurray> library and docker application. However, in releases that
 alexmurray> contain the containerd-app source package, the containerd
 alexmurray> source package contains only the library whilst the docker
 alexmurray> application itself is contained in the containerd-app package.
