Description:
 A flaw was found in the way Samba, as an Active Directory Domain
 Controller, implemented Kerberos name-based authentication. The Samba AD
 DC, could become confused about the user a ticket represents if it did not
 strictly require a Kerberos PAC and always use the SIDs found within. The
 result could include total domain compromise.

Notes: 
 mdeslaur> Fixing this in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS would require substantial
 mdeslaur> code backports. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu 18.04
 mdeslaur> LTS. In environments where this is of concern, we recommend
 mdeslaur> updating to a more recent Ubuntu version.
