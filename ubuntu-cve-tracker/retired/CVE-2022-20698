Description:
 A vulnerability in the OOXML parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)
 Software version 0.104.1 and LTS version 0.103.4 and prior versions could
 allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
 condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
 checks that may result in an invalid pointer read. An attacker could
 exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted OOXML file to an affected
 device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning
 process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
