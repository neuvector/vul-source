Description:
 Doorkeeper version 5.0.0 and later contains an information disclosure
 vulnerability that allows an attacker to retrieve the client secret only
 intended for the OAuth application owner. After authorizing the application
 and allowing access, the attacker simply needs to request the list of their
 authorized applications in a JSON format (usually GET
 /oauth/authorized_applications.json). An application is vulnerable if the
 authorized applications controller is enabled.
