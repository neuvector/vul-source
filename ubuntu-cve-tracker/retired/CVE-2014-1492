Description:
 The cert_TestHostName function in lib/certdb/certdb.c in the
 certificate-checking implementation in Mozilla Network Security Services
 (NSS) before 3.16 accepts a wildcard character that is embedded in an
 internationalized domain name's U-label, which might allow
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a crafted certificate.
