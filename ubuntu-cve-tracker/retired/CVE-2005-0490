Description:
 Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in libcURL and cURL 7.12.1, and
 possibly other versions, allow remote malicious web servers to execute
 arbitrary code via base64 encoded replies that exceed the intended buffer
 lengths when decoded, which is not properly handled by (1) the
 Curl_input_ntlm function in http_ntlm.c during NTLM authentication or (2)
 the Curl_krb_kauth and krb4_auth functions in krb4.c during Kerberos
 authentication.
