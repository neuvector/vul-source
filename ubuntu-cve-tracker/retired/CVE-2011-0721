Description:
 Multiple CRLF injection vulnerabilities in (1) chfn and (2) chsh in shadow
 1:4.1.4 allow local users to add new users or groups to /etc/passwd via the
 GECOS field.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Kees Cook discovered that some shadow utilities did not correctly
 validate user input. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to inject
 newlines into the /etc/passwd file. If the system was configured to use NIS,
 this could lead to existing NIS groups or users gaining or losing access to
 the system, resulting in a denial of service or unauthorized access.
