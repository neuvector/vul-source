Description:
 In Apache Commons Beanutils 1.9.2, a special BeanIntrospector class was
 added which allows suppressing the ability for an attacker to access the
 classloader via the class property available on all Java objects. We,
 however were not using this by default characteristic of the
 PropertyUtilsBean.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Apache Commons BeanUtils improperly handled certain
 input.  An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
