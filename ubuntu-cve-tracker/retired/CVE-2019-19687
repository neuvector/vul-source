Description:
 OpenStack Keystone 15.0.0 and 16.0.0 is affected by Data Leakage in the
 list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any
 credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce_scope is false. Users
 with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials,
 which could (for example) leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time
 Passwords (TOTP). Deployments with enforce_scope set to false are affected.
 (There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API
 once this issue is fixed.)
