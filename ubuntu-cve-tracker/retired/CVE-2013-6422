Description:
 The GnuTLS backend in libcurl 7.21.4 through 7.33.0, when disabling digital
 signature verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER), also disables the
 CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST check for CN or SAN host name fields, which makes it
 easier for remote attackers to spoof servers and conduct man-in-the-middle
 (MITM) attacks.
