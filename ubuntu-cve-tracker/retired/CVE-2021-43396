Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In iconvdata/iso-2022-jp-3.c in the GNU C Library (aka
 glibc) 2.34, remote attackers can force iconv() to emit a spurious '\0'
 character via crafted ISO-2022-JP-3 data that is accompanied by an internal
 state reset. This may affect data integrity in certain iconv() use cases.
 NOTE: the vendor states "the bug cannot be invoked through user input and
 requires iconv to be invoked with a NULL inbuf, which ought to require a
 separate application bug to do so unintentionally. Hence there's no
 security impact to the bug."
