Description:
 URLs using "javascript:" have the protocol removed when pasted into the
 addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if
 a tab character is embedded in the "javascript:" URL the protocol is not
 removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially
 engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves. This vulnerability
 affects Firefox < 59.
