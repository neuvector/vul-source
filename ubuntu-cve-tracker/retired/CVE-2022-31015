Description:
 Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3.
 Waitress versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 may terminate early due to a thread
 closing a socket while the main thread is about to call select(). This will
 lead to the main thread raising an exception that is not handled and then
 causing the entire application to be killed. This issue has been fixed in
 Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to close the socket.
 Instead, that is always delegated to the main thread. There is no
 work-around for this issue. However, users using waitress behind a reverse
 proxy server are less likely to have issues if the reverse proxy always
 reads the full response.
