Description:
 The fix_hostname function in cURL and libcurl 7.37.0 through 7.41.0 does
 not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write and crash) or possibly have
 other unspecified impact via a zero-length host name, as demonstrated by
 "http://:80" and ":80."
