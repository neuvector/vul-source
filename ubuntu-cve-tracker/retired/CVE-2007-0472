Description:
 Multiple race conditions in Smb4K before 0.8.0 allow local users to (1)
 modify arbitrary files via unspecified manipulations of Smb4K's lock file,
 which is not properly handled by the remove_lock_file function in
 core/smb4kfileio.cpp, and (2) add lines to the sudoers file via a symlink
 attack on temporary files, which isn't properly handled by the writeFile
 function in core/smb4kfileio.cpp.
