Description:
 Pillow is a Python imaging library. In versions 11.2.0 to before 11.3.0,
 there is a heap buffer overflow when writing a sufficiently large (>64k
 encoded with default settings) image in the DDS format due to writing into
 a buffer without checking for available space. This only affects users who
 save untrusted data as a compressed DDS image. This issue has been patched
 in version 11.3.0.
