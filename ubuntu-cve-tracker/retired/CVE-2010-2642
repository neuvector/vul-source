 Heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font parser in the dvi-backend
 component in Evince 2.32 and earlier, teTeX 3.0, t1lib 5.1.2, and possibly
 other products allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font
 in conjunction with a DVI file that is processed by the thumbnailer.
