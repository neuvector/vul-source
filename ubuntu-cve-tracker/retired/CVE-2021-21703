Description:
 In PHP versions 7.3.x up to and including 7.3.31, 7.4.x below 7.4.25 and
 8.0.x below 8.0.12, when running PHP FPM SAPI with main FPM daemon process
 running as root and child worker processes running as lower-privileged
 users, it is possible for the child processes to access memory shared with
 the main process and write to it, modifying it in a way that would cause
 the root process to conduct invalid memory reads and writes, which can be
 used to escalate privileges from local unprivileged user to the root user.
