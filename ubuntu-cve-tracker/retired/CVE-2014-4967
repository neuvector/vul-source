Description:
 Multiple argument injection vulnerabilities in Ansible before 1.6.7 allow
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging access to an
 Ansible managed host and providing a crafted fact, as demonstrated by a
 fact with (1) a trailing " src=" clause, (2) a trailing " temp=" clause, or
 (3) a trailing " validate=" clause accompanied by a shell command.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Ansible mishandled certain input. A remote attacker
 could use this to execute arbitrary code.
