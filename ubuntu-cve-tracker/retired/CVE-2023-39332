Description:
 Various `node:fs` functions allow specifying paths as either strings or
 `Uint8Array` objects. In Node.js environments, the `Buffer` class extends
 the `Uint8Array` class. Node.js prevents path traversal through strings
 (see CVE-2023-30584) and `Buffer` objects (see CVE-2023-32004), but not
 through non-`Buffer` `Uint8Array` objects. This is distinct from
 CVE-2023-32004 which only referred to `Buffer` objects. However, the
 vulnerability follows the same pattern using `Uint8Array` instead of
 `Buffer`. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission
 model is an experimental feature of Node.js.
