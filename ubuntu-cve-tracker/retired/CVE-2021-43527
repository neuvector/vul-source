Description:
 NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are
 vulnerable to a heap overflow when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS
 signatures. Applications using NSS for handling signatures encoded within
 CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \#7, or PKCS \#12 are likely to be impacted. Applications
 using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL
 functionality may be impacted, depending on how they configure NSS. *Note:
 This vulnerability does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients
 and PDF viewers that use NSS for signature verification, such as
 Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and Evince are believed to be impacted.
 This vulnerability affects NSS < 3.73 and NSS < 3.68.1.
