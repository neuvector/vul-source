Description:
 OpenStack Keystone through 14.0.1 has a user enumeration vulnerability
 because invalid usernames have much faster responses than valid ones for a
 POST /v3/auth/tokens request. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is a
 hardening opportunity, and not necessarily an issue that should have an
 OpenStack Security Advisory
