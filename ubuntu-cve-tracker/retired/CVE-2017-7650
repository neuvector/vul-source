Description:
 In Mosquitto before 1.4.12, pattern based ACLs can be bypassed by clients
 that set their username/client id to '#' or '+'. This allows locally or
 remotely connected clients to access MQTT topics that they do have the
 rights to. The same issue may be present in third party
 authentication/access control plugins for Mosquitto.
