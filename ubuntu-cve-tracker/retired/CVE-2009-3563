Description:
 ntp_request.c in ntpd in NTP before 4.2.4p8, and 4.2.5, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) by
 using MODE_PRIVATE to send a spoofed (1) request or (2) response packet
 that triggers a continuous exchange of MODE_PRIVATE error responses between
 two NTP daemons.
