Description:
 DISPUTE NOTE: this issue does not pose a security risk as it (according to
 analysis by the original software developer, NLnet Labs) falls within the
 expected functionality and security controls of the application. Red Hat
 has made a claim that there is a security risk within Red Hat products.
 NLnet Labs has no further information about the claim, and suggests that
 affected Red Hat customers refer to available Red Hat documentation or
 support channels. ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: A heap-buffer-overflow flaw was
 found in the cfg_mark_ports function within Unbound's config_file.c, which
 can lead to memory corruption. This issue could allow an attacker with
 local access to provide specially crafted input, potentially causing the
 application to crash or allowing arbitrary code execution. This could
 result in a denial of service or unauthorized actions on the system.
