Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in potrace 1.11 allow remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (crash) via large dimensions in a BMP image, which
 triggers a buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> inkscape in xenial and earlier embeds libpotrace (LP: #1156664)
 tyhicks> I don't see a public development tree for potrace but comment #42 of
  the Debian bug contains a broken out patch from the upstream potrace
  maintainer
 mdeslaur> potrace in inkscape works on bitmaps already loaded, not
 mdeslaur> arbitrary images. Marking as not-affected for inkscape.
