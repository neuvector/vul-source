Description:
 The debug_mode function in web/web.py in OnionShare through 1.3.1, when
 --debug is enabled, uses the /tmp/onionshare_server.log pathname for
 logging, which might allow local users to overwrite files or obtain
 sensitive information by using this pathname.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 john-breton> Per Debian: "Debian uses kernel hardening on Linux by
 john-breton> default which renders this non-exploitable (and the
 john-breton> release notes state that if rolls a custom kernel the
 john-breton> same options need to be enabled). The only remaining 
 john-breton> impact is that on a multi user environment one user
 john-breton> using the debug mode prevents others from using debug
 john-breton> mode, but that's mostly a bug, not a security issue."
 john-breton>
 john-breton> That being said, the fix is trivial. This can be
 john-breton> bundled in with other security fixes, and this bug
 john-breton> can be fixed as a consequence.
