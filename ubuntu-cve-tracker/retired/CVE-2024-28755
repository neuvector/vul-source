Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.5.x before 3.6.0. When an SSL context
 was reset with the mbedtls_ssl_session_reset() API, the maximum TLS version
 to be negotiated was not restored to the configured one. An attacker was
 able to prevent an Mbed TLS server from establishing any TLS 1.3
 connection, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service or forced version
 downgrade from TLS 1.3 to TLS 1.2.
