Description:
 In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate
 internal data structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input
 may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory corruption) or
 other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege boundary in, for
 example, certain web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows
 an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts.
