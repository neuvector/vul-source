Description:
 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of
 Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr. This issue
 affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
 The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure
 and test new Schemas and configSets. However, when the feature was created,
 the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.
 External library loading is only available to configSets that are "trusted"
 (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable
 to perform Remote Code Execution. Since the Schema Designer loaded
 configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were
 created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries
 when used in the Schema Designer. Users are recommended to upgrade to
 version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.
