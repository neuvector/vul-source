Description:
 In Wireshark through 2.0.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.7, the WBXML dissector
 could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a
 malformed capture file. This was addressed in
 epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding validation of the relationships
 between indexes and lengths. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7702.
