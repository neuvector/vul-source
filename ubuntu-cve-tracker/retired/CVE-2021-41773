Description:
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP
 Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to
 files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files
 outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default
 configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI
 scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for
 remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild.
 This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in
 Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
