Description:
 Integer overflow in libaom internal function img_alloc_helper can lead to
 heap buffer overflow. This function can be reached via 3 callers: * Calling
 aom_img_alloc() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align parameter may
 result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets
 and some fields of the returned aom_image_t struct may be invalid. *
 Calling aom_img_wrap() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align
 parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer
 sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom_image_t struct may be
 invalid. * Calling aom_img_alloc_with_border() with a large value of the
 d_w, d_h, align, size_align, or border parameter may result in integer
 overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields
 of the returned aom_image_t struct may be invalid.
