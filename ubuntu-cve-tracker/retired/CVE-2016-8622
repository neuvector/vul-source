Description:
 The URL percent-encoding decode function in libcurl before 7.51.0 is called
 `curl_easy_unescape`. Internally, even if this function would be made to
 allocate a unscape destination buffer larger than 2GB, it would return that
 new length in a signed 32 bit integer variable, thus the length would get
 either just truncated or both truncated and turned negative. That could
 then lead to libcurl writing outside of its heap based buffer.
