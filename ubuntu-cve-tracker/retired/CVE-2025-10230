Description:
 A flaw was found in Samba, in the front-end WINS hook handling: NetBIOS
 names from registration packets are passed to a shell without proper
 validation or escaping. Unsanitized NetBIOS name data from WINS
 registration packets are inserted into a shell command and executed by the
 Samba Active Directory Domain Controller’s wins hook, allowing an
 unauthenticated network attacker to achieve remote command execution as the
 Samba process.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> per Samba developers "WINS is an obsolete and trusting protocol"
 mdeslaur> and "The WINS server used by Samba when it is not a domain
 mdeslaur> controller is unaffected."
 mdeslaur> Per Samba developers, this is an unusual configuration and
 mdeslaur> "will affect very few, possibly zero, users"
