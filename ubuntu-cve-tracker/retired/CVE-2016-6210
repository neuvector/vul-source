Description:
 sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3, when SHA256 or SHA512 are used for user
 password hashing, uses BLOWFISH hashing on a static password when the
 username does not exist, which allows remote attackers to enumerate users
 by leveraging the timing difference between responses when a large password
 is provided.
