Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the demux_nsf_send_headers function in
 src/demuxers/demux_nsf.c in xine-lib allows remote attackers to have an
 unknown impact via a long copyright field in an NSF header in an NES Sound
 file, a different issue than CVE-2008-1878.  NOTE: a third party claims
 that the copyright field always has a safe length
