Description:
 Sudo before 1.9.15 might allow row hammer attacks (for authentication
 bypass or privilege escalation) because application logic sometimes is
 based on not equaling an error value (instead of equaling a success value),
 and because the values do not resist flips of a single bit.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> part of the code in the fix commit, in plugins/sudoers/auth/passwd.c,
  plugins/sudoers/auth/sudo_auth.c and plugins/sudoers/auth/sudo_auth.h is not built
  with Ubuntu as it is using PAM support. for the other part, the code fixed in
  plugins/sudoers/lookup.c was added in version 1.9.15. hence not affecting any
  Ubuntu releases, and for plugins/sudoers/match.c, part was added in 1.8.21, that
  if considered just by itself, it doesn't worth patching.
