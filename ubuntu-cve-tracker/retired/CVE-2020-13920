Description:
 Apache ActiveMQ uses LocateRegistry.createRegistry() to create the JMX RMI
 registry and binds the server to the "jmxrmi" entry. It is possible to
 connect to the registry without authentication and call the rebind method
 to rebind jmxrmi to something else. If an attacker creates another server
 to proxy the original, and bound that, he effectively becomes a man in the
 middle and is able to intercept the credentials when an user connects.
 Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.12.
