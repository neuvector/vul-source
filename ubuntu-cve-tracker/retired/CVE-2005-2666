Description:
 SSH, as implemented in OpenSSH before 4.0 and possibly other
 implementations, stores hostnames, IP addresses, and keys in plaintext in
 the known_hosts file, which makes it easier for an attacker that has
 compromised an SSH user's account to generate a list of additional targets
 that are more likely to have the same password or key.
