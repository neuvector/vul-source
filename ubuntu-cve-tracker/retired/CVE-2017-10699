Description:
 avcodec 2.2.x, as used in VideoLAN VLC media player 2.2.7-x before
 2017-06-29, allows out-of-bounds heap memory write due to calling memcpy()
 with a wrong size, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly code execution.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that VLC mishandled certain crafted media files. An attacker
 could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code.
Notes:
 ratliff> notes from the upstream:
 ratliff> "The avcodec library does not gives bogus video sizes on 3.0, so the
 ratliff> issue only exists on the 2.2.x branch. Fixes have been pushed on the
 ratliff> 2.2.x branch and guards added as well on both versions."
