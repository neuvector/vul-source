Description:
 Tenshi 0.15 creates a tenshi.pid file after dropping privileges to a
 non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes
 by leveraging access to this non-root account for tenshi.pid modification
 before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname/tenshi.pid`" command.
