Description:
 GNU Mailman before 2.1.35 may allow remote Privilege Escalation. A
 csrf_token value is not specific to a single user account. An attacker can
 obtain a value within the context of an unprivileged user account, and then
 use that value in a CSRF attack against an admin (e.g., for account
 takeover).
