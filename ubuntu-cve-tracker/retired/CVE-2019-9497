Description:
 The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server and wpa_supplicant EAP
 Peer do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. This
 vulnerability may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication
 without knowing the password. However, unless the crypto library does not
 implement additional checks for the EC point, the attacker will not be able
 to derive the session key or complete the key exchange. Both hostapd with
 SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including
 version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and
 wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are
 affected.
