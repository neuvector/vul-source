Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** GNOME Seahorse through 3.30 allows physically proximate
 attackers to read plaintext passwords by using the quickAllow dialog at an
 unattended workstation, if the keyring is unlocked. NOTE: this is disputed
 by a software maintainer because the behavior represents a design decision.
