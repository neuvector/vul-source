Description:
 A flaw was found in python-cryptography versions between >=1.9.0 and <2.3.
 The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user
 did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag
 an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1
 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check.
 GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.
