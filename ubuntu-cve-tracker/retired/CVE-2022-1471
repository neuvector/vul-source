Description:
 SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be
 instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by
 an attacker can lead to remote code execution. We recommend using
 SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to restrict
 deserialization. We recommend upgrading to version 2.0 and beyond.
Ubuntu-Description:

 john-breton> but the version is not backwards compatible and 
 john-breton> considered breaking by upstream. It cannot be used
 john-breton> to patch the vulnerability in this case, and the
 john-breton> documentation is already clear to avoid this issue.
