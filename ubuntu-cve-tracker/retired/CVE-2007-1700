Description:
 The session extension in PHP 4 before 4.4.5, and PHP 5 before 5.2.1,
 calculates the reference count for the session variables without
 considering the internal pointer from the session globals, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted string
 in the session_register after unsetting HTTP_SESSION_VARS and _SESSION,
 which destroys the session data Hashtable.
