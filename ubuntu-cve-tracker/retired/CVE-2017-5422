Description:
 If a malicious site uses the "view-source:" protocol in a series within a
 single hyperlink, it can trigger a non-exploitable browser crash when the
 hyperlink is selected. This was fixed by no longer making "view-source:"
 linkable. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 52 and Thunderbird < 52.
