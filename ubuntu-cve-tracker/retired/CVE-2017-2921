Description:
 An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket
 protocol implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted
 websocket packet can cause an integer overflow, leading to a heap buffer
 overflow and resulting in denial of service and potential remote code
 execution. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted websocket packet
 over network to trigger this vulnerability.
