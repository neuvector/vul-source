Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the rb_ary_store function in Ruby 1.8.4 and
 earlier, 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, and 1.8.7 before
 1.8.7-p22 allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code or
 cause a denial of service via unknown vectors, a different issue than
 CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2664, and CVE-2008-2725. NOTE: as of 20080624,
 there has been inconsistent usage of multiple CVE identifiers related to
 Ruby. The CVE description should be regarded as authoritative, although it
 is likely to change.
