 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6735-1
Description:
 The generateKeys() API function returned from crypto.createDiffieHellman()
 only generates missing (or outdated) keys, that is, it only generates a
 private key if none has been set yet, but the function is also needed to
 compute the corresponding public key after calling setPrivateKey().
 However, the documentation says this API call: "Generates private and
 public Diffie-Hellman key values".
 
 The documented behavior is very different from the actual behavior, and
 this difference could easily lead to security issues in applications that
 use these APIs as the DiffieHellman may be used as the basis for
 application-level security, implications are consequently broad.
