Description:
 GNU adns 1.4 and earlier uses a fixed source port and sequential
 transaction IDs for DNS requests, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to spoof DNS responses, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2008-1447.  NOTE: the vendor reports that this is intended behavior and
 is compatible with the product's intended role in a trusted environment.
