Description:
 madvise_remove in Linux kernel 2.6.16 up to 2.6.16.6 does not follow file
 and mmap restrictions, which allows local users to bypass IPC permissions
 and replace portions of readonly tmpfs files with zeroes, aka the
 MADV_REMOVE vulnerability.  NOTE: this description was originally written
 in a way that combined two separate issues.  The mprotect issue now has a
 separate name, CVE-2006-2071.
