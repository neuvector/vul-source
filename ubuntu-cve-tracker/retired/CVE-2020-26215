Description:
 Jupyter Notebook before version 6.1.5 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A
 maliciously crafted link to a notebook server could redirect the browser to
 a different website. All notebook servers are technically affected,
 however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for
 known notebook server hosts. A link to your notebook server may appear
 safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.
 The issue is patched in version 6.1.5.
