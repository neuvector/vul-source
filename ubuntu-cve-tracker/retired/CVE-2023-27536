Description:
 An authentication bypass vulnerability exists libcurl <8.0.0 in the
 connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established connections
 with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for changes in
 the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects
 krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in
 unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not
 reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.
