Description:
 The process_bin_delete function in memcached.c in memcached 1.4.4 and other
 versions before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a request
 to delete a key, which does not account for the lack of a null terminator
 in the key and triggers a buffer over-read when printing to stderr.
