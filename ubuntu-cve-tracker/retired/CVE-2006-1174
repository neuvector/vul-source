Description:
 useradd in shadow-utils before 4.0.3, and possibly other versions before
 4.0.8, does not provide a required argument to the open function when
 creating a new user mailbox, which causes the mailbox to be created with
 unpredictable permissions and possibly allows attackers to read or modify
 the mailbox.
