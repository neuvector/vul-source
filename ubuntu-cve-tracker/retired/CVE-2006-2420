Description:
 Bugzilla 2.20rc1 through 2.20 and 2.21.1, when using RSS 1.0, allows remote
 attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a title element
 with HTML encoded sequences such as "&gt;", which are automatically decoded
 by some RSS readers.  NOTE: this issue is not in Bugzilla itself, but
 rather due to design or documentation inconsistencies within RSS, or
 implementation vulnerabilities in RSS readers.  While this issue normally
 would not be included in CVE, it is being identified since the Bugzilla
 developers have addressed it.
