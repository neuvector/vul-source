Description:
 elf/dl-load.c in ld.so in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through
 2.11.2, and 2.12.x through 2.12.1, does not properly handle a value of
 $ORIGIN for the LD_AUDIT environment variable, which allows local users to
 gain privileges via a crafted dynamic shared object (DSO) located in an
 arbitrary directory.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 kees> $ORIGIN expansion was not possible on Ubuntu due to lack of NDEBUG during build.
