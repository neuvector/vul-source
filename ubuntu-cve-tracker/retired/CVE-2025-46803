Description:
 The default mode of pseudo terminals (PTYs) allocated by Screen was changed
 from 0620 to 0622, thereby allowing anyone to write to any Screen PTYs in
 the system.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> only 5.0.0 is vulnerable, but older version should explicitly
 mdeslaur> be compiled with the option to force the proper mode as a
 mdeslaur> packaging build improvement.
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu only has older versions, and the recommended option
 mdeslaur> change would only be a build change which should not result in a
 mdeslaur> change in any binary package.
