Description:
 rpcapd/daemon.c in libpcap before 1.9.1 mishandles certain length values
 because of reuse of a variable. This may open up an attack vector involving
 extra data at the end of a request.

Notes: 
 sbeattie> this is likely actually fixed by
   449d95265252b291711899fd288836414791930d, and thus only affects
   windows platforms.
 sbeattie> even if accurate, it's against the libpcap daemon, introduced
   in 1.9.0 and is not included in debian/ubuntu packaging
