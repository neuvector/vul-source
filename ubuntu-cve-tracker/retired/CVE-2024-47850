Description:
 CUPS cups-browsed before 2.5b1 will send an HTTP POST request to an
 arbitrary destination and port in response to a single IPP UDP packet
 requesting a printer to be added, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2024-47176. (The request is meant to probe the new printer but can be
 used to create DDoS amplification attacks.)
