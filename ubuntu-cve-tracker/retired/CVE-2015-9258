Description:
 In Docker Notary before 0.1, gotuf/signed/verify.go has a Signature
 Algorithm Not Matched to Key vulnerability. Because an attacker controls
 the field specifying the signature algorithm, they might (for example) be
 able to forge a signature by forcing a misinterpretation of an RSA-PSS key
 as Ed25519 elliptic-curve data.
