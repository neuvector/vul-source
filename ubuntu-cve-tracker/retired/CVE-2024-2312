Description:
 GRUB2 does not call the module fini functions on exit, leading to
 Debian/Ubuntu's peimage GRUB2 module leaving UEFI system table hooks after
 exit. This lead to a use-after-free condition, and could possibly lead to
 secure boot bypass.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
 mdeslaur> this is fixed in grub2-unsigned (2.12~rc1-10ubuntu4.2) and
 mdeslaur> grub2-signed (1.197.2) in mantic-proposed.
