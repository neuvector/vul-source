Description:
 Git is a distributed revision control system. Git prior to versions 2.37.1,
 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5, is vulnerable
 to privilege escalation in all platforms. An unsuspecting user could still
 be affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765, for example when
 navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them, but
 where an attacker could create a git repository. Versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2,
 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5 contain a patch for this
 issue. The simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described in
 the example is to avoid running git as root (or an Administrator in
 Windows), and if needed to reduce its use to a minimum. While a generic
 workaround is not possible, a system could be hardened from the exploit
 described in the example by removing any such repository if it exists
 already and creating one as root to block any future attacks.
