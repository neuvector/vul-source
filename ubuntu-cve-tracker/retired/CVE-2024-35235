Description:
 OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other
 Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting
 the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic
 link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the
 provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given
 that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of
 permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the
 aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability
 is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific
 case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen
 argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf
 configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in
 cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a
 `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root)
 command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu
 systems to achieve full root command execution. Commit
 ff1f8a623e090dee8a8aadf12a6a4b25efac143d contains a patch for the issue.

Notes:
 alexmurray> requires the attacker to be able to modify /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
  which NOT world-writable so requires combination with another
  vulnerability to be successfully exploited by an unprivileged user.
