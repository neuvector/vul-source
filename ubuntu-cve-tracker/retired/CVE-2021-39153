Description:
 XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load
 and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the
 processed input stream, if using the version out of the box with Java
 runtime version 14 to 8 or with JavaFX installed. No user is affected, who
 followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a
 whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no
 longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general
 purpose.
