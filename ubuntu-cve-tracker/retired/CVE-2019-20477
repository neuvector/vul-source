Description:
 PyYAML 5.1 through 5.1.2 has insufficient restrictions on the load and
 load_all functions because of a class deserialization issue, e.g., Popen is
 a class in the subprocess module. NOTE: this issue exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2017-18342.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> CVE-2017-18342 resulted in the load() function being
 mdeslaur> deprecated in 5.1+ in eoan and later. It did not get fixed in
 mdeslaur> previous release because of compatibility issues. This CVE
 mdeslaur> therefore only really applies to eoan and later.
