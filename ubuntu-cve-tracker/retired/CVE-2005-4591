Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in bogofilter 0.96.2, 0.95.2, 0.94.14, 0.94.12,
 and other versions from 0.93.5 to 0.96.2, when using Unicode databases,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
 execute arbitrary code via "invalid input sequences" that lead to heap
 corruption when bogofilter or bogolexer converts character sets.
