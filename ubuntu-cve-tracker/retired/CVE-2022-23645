Description:
 swtpm is a libtpms-based TPM emulator with socket, character device, and
 Linux CUSE interface. Versions prior to 0.5.3, 0.6.2, and 0.7.1 are
 vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted header of swtpm's
 state, where the blobheader's hdrsize indicator has an invalid value, may
 cause an out-of-bounds access when the byte array representing the state of
 the TPM is accessed. This will likely crash swtpm or prevent it from
 starting since the state cannot be understood. Users should upgrade to
 swtpm v0.5.3, v0.6.2, or v0.7.1 to receive a patch. There are currently no
 known workarounds.
