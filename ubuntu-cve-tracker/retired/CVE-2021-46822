Description:
 The PPM reader in libjpeg-turbo through 2.0.90 mishandles use of
 tjLoadImage for loading a 16-bit binary PPM file into a grayscale buffer
 and loading a 16-bit binary PGM file into an RGB buffer. This is related to
 a heap-based buffer overflow in the get_word_rgb_row function in rdppm.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> per the upstream fix, no known applications attempt to load a
 mdeslaur> 16-bit PPM file into a grayscale uncompressed image buffer,
 mdeslaur> which is the vulnerability described in this CVE. As such,
 mdeslaur> downgrading priority to low as this vulnerability isn't exposed.
 ccdm94> As per the description in commit f35fd27ec64, this only affects
 ccdm94> versions of libjpeg-turbo which have the tjLoadImage function
 ccdm94> implemented. This function was introduced by commit aa7459050.
 ccdm94> The code related to this commit is not present in bionic and
 ccdm94> earlier, meaning that these releases are not vulnerable (this
 ccdm94> affects libjpeg-turbo > 1.5.3).
