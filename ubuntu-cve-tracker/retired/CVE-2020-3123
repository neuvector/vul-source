 A vulnerability in the Data-Loss-Prevention (DLP) module in Clam AntiVirus
 (ClamAV) Software versions 0.102.1 and 0.102.0 could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on
 an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read

 could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email file to an
 affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV
 scanning process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
