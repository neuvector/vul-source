Description:
 An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9 that allows remote
 attackers to trigger use of an intended public key for encryption, because
 incorrect regular expressions are used for extraction of an e-mail address
 from a comma-separated list, as demonstrated by a modified Full Name field
 and a homograph attack, aka TBE-01-002.
