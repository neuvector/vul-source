Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the script_write_params method in
 client/dhclient.c in ISC DHCP dhclient 4.1 before 4.1.0p1, 4.0 before
 4.0.1p1, 3.1 before 3.1.2p1, 3.0, and 2.0 allows remote DHCP servers to
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted subnet-mask option.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> requires connecting to a malicious dhcp v4 server. Assigning
  high priority due to widespread use and frequency of roaming users connecting
  to untrusted dhcp servers
 jdstrand> CERT VU#410676
 jdstrand> this is only a DoS on Intrepid and later due to FORTIFY_SOURCE and
  can be considered 'low'. Jaunty also has an AppArmor profile that fully
  mitigates arbitrary code execution.
 jdstrand> dhcp v2 is not affected because it checks that lease -> options
  [DHO_SUBNET_MASK].len < sizeof lease -> address.iabuf. address.iabuf is
  the same size as netmask.iabuf. Furthermore, subnet_number() and
  broadcast_addr() (further below) properly check/use the length of netmask
