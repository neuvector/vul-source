Description:
 A flaw was found in rsync. It could allow a server to enumerate the
 contents of an arbitrary file from the client's machine. This issue occurs
 when files are being copied from a client to a server. During this process,
 the rsync server will send checksums of local data to the client to compare
 with in order to determine what data needs to be sent to the server. By
 sending specially constructed checksum values for arbitrary files, an
 attacker may be able to reconstruct the data of those files byte-by-byte
 based on the responses from the client.
