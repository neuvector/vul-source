Description:
 The UTF-8 decoder in codecs/qutfcodec.cpp in Qt 3.3.8 and 4.2.3 does not
 reject long UTF-8 sequences as required by the standard, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and directory
 traversal attacks via long sequences that decode to dangerous
 metacharacters.
