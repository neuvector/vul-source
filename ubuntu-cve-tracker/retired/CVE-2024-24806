Description:
 libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.
 The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows
 counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters
 before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create
 addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by
 `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to
 unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability
 arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256
 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in
 `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets
 truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be
 able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that
 allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that
 crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a
 malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been
 addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There
 are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
