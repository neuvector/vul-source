Description:
 The QMP migrate command in QEMU version 4.0.0 and earlier is vulnerable to
 OS command injection, which allows the remote attacker to achieve code
 execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by sending a
 crafted QMP command to the listening server. Note: This has been disputed
 as a non-issue since QEMU's -qmp interface is meant to be used by trusted
 users. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket open to the
 internet, then it is an insecure configuration issue
