Description:
 Multiple TCP implementations with Protection Against Wrapped Sequence
 Numbers (PAWS) with the timestamps option enabled allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (connection loss) via a spoofed packet with a
 large timer value, which causes the host to discard later packets because
 they appear to be too old.
