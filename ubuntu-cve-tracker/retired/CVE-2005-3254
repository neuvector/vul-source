Description:
 The CGIwrap program before 3.9 on Debian GNU/Linux uses an incorrect
 minimum value of 100 for a UID to determine whether it can perform a
 seteuid operation, which could allow attackers to execute code as other
 system UIDs that are greater than the minimum value, which should be 1000
 on Debian systems.
