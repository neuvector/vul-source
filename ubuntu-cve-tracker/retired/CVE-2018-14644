Description:
 An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including
 4.1.4. A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can
 lead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only
 arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers for
 that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the
 meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC
 validation will be answered with a ServFail.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 hlibk> pdns is not affected, but pdns-recursor is.
 hlibk> DNSSEC processing is disabled on xenial.
