Description:
 The implementations of SAE in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable to
 side channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache
 access patterns. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a
 side channel attack that can be used for full password recovery. Both
 hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and
 including version 2.7 are affected.
