Description:
 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
 vulnerability in warmcat libwebsockets allows Pointer Manipulation,
 potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access. This issue affects
 libwebsockets before 4.3.4 and is present in code built specifically for
 the Win32 platform.
 
 By default, the affected code is not executed unless one of the following
 conditions is met:
 
 LWS_WITHOUT_EXTENSIONS (default ON) is manually set to OFF in CMake.
 LWS_WITH_HTTP_STREAM_COMPRESSION (default OFF) is manually set to ON in
 CMake.
 Despite these conditions, when triggered in affected configurations, this
 vulnerability may allow attackers to manipulate pointers, potentially
 leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
