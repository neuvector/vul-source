Description:
 Thunderbird's handling of the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header can
 be exploited to execute JavaScript in the file:/// context. By crafting a
 nested email attachment (message/rfc822) and setting its content type to
 application/pdf, Thunderbird may incorrectly render it as HTML when opened,
 allowing the embedded JavaScript to run without requiring a file download.
 This behavior relies on Thunderbird auto-saving the attachment to /tmp and
 linking to it via the file:/// protocol, potentially enabling JavaScript
 execution as part of the HTML. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
 128.10.1 and Thunderbird < 138.0.1.
