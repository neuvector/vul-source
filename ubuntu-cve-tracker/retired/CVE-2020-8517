Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. Due to incorrect input
 validation, the NTLM authentication credentials parser in ext_lm_group_acl
 may write to memory outside the credentials buffer. On systems with memory
 access protections, this can result in the helper process being terminated
 unexpectedly. This leads to the Squid process also terminating and a denial
 of service for all clients using the proxy.
