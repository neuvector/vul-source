Description:
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0
 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have
 other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote
 character.
