Description:
 Windows NTLM V1 Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Squid 7.1 removed the basic_smb_lm_auth and ntlm_smb_lm_auth
 mdeslaur> authentication helpers and recommend using the ntml_auth helper
 mdeslaur> from Samba instead.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> While it is unlikely LM authentication is still being used,
 mdeslaur> updating Squid packages will break existing deployments. We will
 mdeslaur> not be removing the helpers in Ubuntu stable releases.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> We recommend switching to the ntml_auth helper from Samba in
 mdeslaur> environments that still require this sort of authentication.
Mitigation:
 This CVE can be mitigated by switching from basic_smb_lm_auth and
 ntlm_smb_lm_auth to the ntml_auth helper in Samba.
