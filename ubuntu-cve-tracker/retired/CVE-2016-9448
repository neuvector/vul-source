Description:
 The TIFFFetchNormalTag function in LibTiff 4.0.6 allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) by setting
 the tags TIFF_SETGET_C16ASCII or TIFF_SETGET_C32_ASCII to values that
 access 0-byte arrays.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9297.
