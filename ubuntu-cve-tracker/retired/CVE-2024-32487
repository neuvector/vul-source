Description:
 less through 653 allows OS command execution via a newline character in the
 name of a file, because quoting is mishandled in filename.c. Exploitation
 typically requires use with attacker-controlled file names, such as the
 files extracted from an untrusted archive. Exploitation also requires the
 LESSOPEN environment variable, but this is set by default in many common
 cases.
