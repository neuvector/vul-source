Description:
 If a URL using the "file:" protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab
 that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file
 corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the
 target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the
 "noopener" keyword. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
