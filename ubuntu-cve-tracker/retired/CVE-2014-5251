Description:
 The MySQL token driver in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2014.1.x before
 2014.1.2.1 and Juno before Juno-3 stores timestamps with the incorrect
 precision, which causes the expiration comparison for tokens to fail and
 allows remote authenticated users to retain access via an expired token.
