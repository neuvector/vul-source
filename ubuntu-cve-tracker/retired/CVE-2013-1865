Description:
 OpenStack Keystone Folsom (2012.2) does not properly perform revocation
 checks for Keystone PKI tokens when done through a server, which allows
 remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a revoked PKI
 token.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> Keystone on 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with other
  components such as nova and horizon
 jdstrand> requires non-standard configuration (ie, using PKI tokens instead
  of UUID)
 jdstrand> per upstream, grizzly is not affected
 jdstrand> Essex does not support PKI tokens and is therefore not affected
