Description:
 OpenSSH 4.3p2, and probably other versions, allows local users to hijack
 forwarded X connections by causing ssh to set DISPLAY to :10, even when
 another process is listening on the associated port, as demonstrated by
 opening TCP port 6010 (IPv4) and sniffing a cookie sent by Emacs.
