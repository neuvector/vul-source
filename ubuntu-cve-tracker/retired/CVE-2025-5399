Description:
 Due to a mistake in libcurl's WebSocket code, a malicious server can send a
 particularly crafted packet which makes libcurl get trapped in an endless
 busy-loop.
 
 There is no other way for the application to escape or exit this loop other
 than killing the thread/process.
 
 This might be used to DoS libcurl-using application.
