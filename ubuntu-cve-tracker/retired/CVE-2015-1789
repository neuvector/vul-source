Description:
 The X509_cmp_time function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read
 and application crash) via a crafted length field in ASN1_TIME data, as
 demonstrated by an attack against a server that supports client
 authentication with a custom verification callback.
