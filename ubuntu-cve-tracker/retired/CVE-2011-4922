Description:
 cipher.c in the Cipher API in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.7.10 retains
 encryption-key data in process memory, which might allow local users to
 obtain sensitive information by reading a core file or other representation
 of memory contents.

 It was discovered that libpurple versions prior to 2.7.10 do not properly
 clear certain data structures used in libpurple/cipher.c prior to freeing. An
 attacker could potentially extract partial information from memory regions
 freed by libpurple.
