Description:
 Ruby 1.8.5 and earlier, 1.8.6 through 1.8.6-p286, 1.8.7 through 1.8.7-p71,
 and 1.9 through r18423 does not properly restrict access to critical
 variables and methods at various safe levels, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via (1)
 untrace_var, (2) $PROGRAM_NAME, and (3) syslog at safe level 4, and (4)
 insecure methods at safe levels 1 through 3.
