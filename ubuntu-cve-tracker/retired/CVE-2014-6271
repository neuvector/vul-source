Description:
 GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions
 in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by
 vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and
 mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified
 DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs
 across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock."  NOTE:
 the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been
 assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the
 incorrect fix.
