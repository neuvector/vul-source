Description:
 A grant unmapping issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. When removing
 or replacing a grant mapping, the x86 PV specific path needs to make sure
 page table entries remain in sync with other accounting done. Although the
 identity of the page frame was validated correctly, neither the presence of
 the mapping nor page writability were taken into account.
