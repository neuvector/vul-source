Description:
 AIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment. From versions 0.13 to
 0.19.1, there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in AIDE. An
 attacker can crash the program during report printing or database listing
 after setting extended file attributes with an empty attribute value or
 with a key containing a comma. A local user might exploit this to cause a
 local denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A
 workaround involves removing xattrs group from rules matching files on
 affected file systems.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Rajesh Pangare discovered that AIDE incorrectly handled extended file attributes.
 A local attacker could possibly use this issues to cause a denial of service.
