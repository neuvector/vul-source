Description:
 The query planner in PostgreSQL before 8.0.11, 8.1 before 8.1.7, and 8.2
 before 8.2.2 does not verify that a table is compatible with a "previously
 made query plan," which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
 of service (server crash) and possibly access database content via an
 "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" SQL statement, which can be leveraged to read arbitrary
 memory from the server.
