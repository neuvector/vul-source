Description:
 An issue was discovered in ecma/operations/ecma-container-object.c in
 JerryScript 2.2.0. Operations with key/value pairs did not consider the
 case where garbage collection is triggered after the key operation but
 before the value operation, as demonstrated by improper read access to
 memory in ecma_gc_set_object_visited in ecma/base/ecma-gc.c.
