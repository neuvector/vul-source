Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime
 Environment (JRE) 6 Update 12 and earlier allow remote attackers to access
 files or execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted PNG image that triggers
 an integer overflow during memory allocation for display on the splash
 screen, aka CR 6804996; and (2) a crafted GIF image from which unspecified
 values are used in calculation of offsets, leading to object-pointer
 corruption, aka CR 6804997.
