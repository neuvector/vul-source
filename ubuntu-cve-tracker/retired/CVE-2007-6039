Description:
 PHP 5.2.5 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial
 of service (application crash) via a long string in (1) the domain
 parameter to the dgettext function, the message parameter to the (2)
 dcgettext or (3) gettext function, the msgid1 parameter to the (4)
 dngettext or (5) ngettext function, or (6) the classname parameter to the
 stream_wrapper_register function.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability
 in most web server environments that support multiple threads, unless this
 issue can be demonstrated for code execution.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> arguments to functions in question should be under control of
   the script author, so not security-sensitive
