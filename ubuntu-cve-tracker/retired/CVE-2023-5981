Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> in order to backport the patch for this CVE for xenial and earlier
 ccdm94> it is necessary to also include the changes from commit 4804febdd,
 ccdm94> which is also the fix for CVE-2018-16868, due to the use of function
 ccdm94> 'gnutls_privkey_decrypt_data2' in the patch. However, to successfully
 ccdm94> add the fix for CVE-2018-16868 it is required that the patch for
 ccdm94> CVE-2018-16869 also be applied to nettle, which is not possible for
 ccdm94> xenial and earlier due to it being too intrusive. Therefore, it will
 ccdm94> not be possible to patch CVE-2023-5981 in xenial and earlier because
 ccdm94> it would also be considered too intrusive in this case.
