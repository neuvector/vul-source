Description:
 Libntlm through 1.5 relies on a fixed buffer size for tSmbNtlmAuthRequest,
 tSmbNtlmAuthChallenge, and tSmbNtlmAuthResponse read and write operations,
 as demonstrated by a stack-based buffer over-read in
 buildSmbNtlmAuthRequest in smbutil.c for a crafted NTLM request.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Libntlm incorrectly handled specially crafted NTML
 requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
 service or another unspecified impact.
