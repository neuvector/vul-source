Description:
 Buffer overflow in the RPC library (lib/rpc/rpc_dtablesize.c) used by
 libgssrpc and kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.2.2, and probably other
 versions before 1.3, when running on systems whose unistd.h does not define
 the FD_SETSIZE macro, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by triggering a large number of
 open file descriptors.
