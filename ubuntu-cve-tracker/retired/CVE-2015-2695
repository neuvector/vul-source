Description:
 lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego_mech.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.14
 relies on an inappropriate context handle, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer read and process crash) via a
 crafted SPNEGO packet that is mishandled during a gss_inquire_context call.
