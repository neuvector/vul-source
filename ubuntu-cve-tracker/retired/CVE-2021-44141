Description:
 All versions of Samba prior to 4.15.5 are vulnerable to a malicious client
 using a server symlink to determine if a file or directory exists in an
 area of the server file system not exported under the share definition.
 SMB1 with unix extensions has to be enabled in order for this attack to
 succeed.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> per upstream, fixing this required a whole rewrite of the VFS
 mdeslaur> layer and there is no reasonable way to fix this in versions
 mdeslaur> older than 4.15.x. Marking this CVE as ignored for older
 mdeslaur> releases.
Mitigation: 
 This issue can be mitigated by disabling SMB1, which is the default
 configuration in Samba 4.11 and above. In environments where SMB1 cannot
 be disabled, symlink support can be disabled with unix extensions = no.
