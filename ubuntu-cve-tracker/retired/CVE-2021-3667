Description:
 An improper locking issue was found in the virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath
 API of libvirt. It occurs in the storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function
 where a locked virStoragePoolObj object is not properly released on ACL
 permission failure. Clients connecting to the read-write socket with
 limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to acquire the lock and prevent
 other users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, resulting in a denial
 of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
 system availability.
