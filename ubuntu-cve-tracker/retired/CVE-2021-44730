Description:
 snapd 2.54.2 did not properly validate the location of the snap-confine
 binary. A local attacker who can hardlink this binary to another location
 to cause snap-confine to execute other arbitrary binaries and hence gain
 privilege escalation. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04
 and 2.54.3+21.10.1
