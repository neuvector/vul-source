Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the WV library in wvWare (formerly
 mswordview) before 1.2.3, as used by AbiWord, KWord, and possibly other
 products, allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
 via a crafted Microsoft Word (DOC) file that produces (1) large LFO clfolvl
 values in the wvGetLFO_records function or (2) a large LFO nolfo value in
 the wvGetFLO_PLF function.
