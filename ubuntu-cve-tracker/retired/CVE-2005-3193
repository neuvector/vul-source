Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the JPXStream::readCodestream function in the
 JPX stream parsing code (JPXStream.c) for xpdf 3.01 and earlier, as used in
 products such as (1) Poppler, (2) teTeX, (3) KDE kpdf, (4) CUPS, and (5)
 libextractor allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service
 (heap corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF
 file with large size values that cause insufficient memory to be allocated.
