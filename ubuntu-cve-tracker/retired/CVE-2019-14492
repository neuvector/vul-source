Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 3.4.7 and 4.x before 4.1.1. There
 is an out of bounds read/write in the function
 HaarEvaluator::OptFeature::calc in modules/objdetect/src/cascadedetect.hpp,
 which leads to denial of service.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenCV incorrectly handled certain files. An attaacker
 could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
Notes:
 ccdm94> the commit that fixes this issue is the same as the one for
 ccdm94> CVE-2019-14491. See: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/15150.
 ccdm94> In xenial and earlier, it is necessary to backport the fix
 ccdm94> for this CVE. However, changes in the code that have occurred
 ccdm94> since the release of versions available in xenial and earlier
 ccdm94> cause this backport to be quite intrusive. To backport and
 ccdm94> properly apply the patch, it would be necessary to alter
 ccdm94> library functions that are exported, meaning that it would be
 ccdm94> necessary to alter their interfaces, which could end up
 ccdm94> causing regressions in software that uses the opencv library
 ccdm94> to operate. It also seems like a backported version of the
 ccdm94> patch does not completely fix the vulnerability, with the POC
 ccdm94> file causing a similar crash, even after the fix is applied.
