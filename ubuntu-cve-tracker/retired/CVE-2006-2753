Description:
 SQL injection vulnerability in MySQL 4.1.x before 4.1.20 and 5.0.x before
 5.0.22 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands
 via crafted multibyte encodings in character sets such as SJIS, BIG5, and
 GBK, which are not properly handled when the mysql_real_escape function is
 used to escape the input.
