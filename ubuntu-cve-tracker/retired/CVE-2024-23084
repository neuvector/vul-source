Description:
 Apfloat v1.10.1 was discovered to contain an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
 via the component org.apfloat.internal.DoubleCRTMath::add(double[],
 double[]). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe
 there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a
 vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not
 sufficiently robust for vulnerability identification.
