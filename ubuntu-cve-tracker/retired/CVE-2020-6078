Description:
 An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the
 message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing
 mDNS messages in mdns_recv, the return value of the mdns_read_header
 function is not checked, leading to an uninitialized variable usage that
 eventually results in a null pointer dereference, leading to service crash.
 An attacker can send a series of mDNS messages to trigger this
 vulnerability.
