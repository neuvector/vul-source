Description:
 suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 does not verify combinations of
 user and group IDs on the command line, which might allow local users to
 leverage other vulnerabilities to create arbitrary UID/GID owned files if
 /proc is mounted.  NOTE: the researcher, who is reliable, claims that the
 vendor disputes the issue because "the attacks described rely on an
 insecure server configuration" in which the user "has write access to the
 document root."  In addition, because this is dependent on other
 vulnerabilities, perhaps this is resultant and should not be included in
 CVE.
