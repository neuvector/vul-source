Description:
 containerd is an open source container runtime. Before versions 1.6.18 and
 1.5.18, when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of
 bytes read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file
 where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service. This bug has
 been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18. Users should update to these
 versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted
 images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import
 images.
