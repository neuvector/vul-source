Description:
 cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and
 recipes to Python developers. Starting in version 38.0.0 and prior to
 version 42.0.4, if `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called with
 both a certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key
 and an `encryption_algorithm` with `hmac_hash` set (via
 `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`, then a NULL
 pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process. This has been
 resolved in version 42.0.4, the first version in which a `ValueError` is
 properly raised.
