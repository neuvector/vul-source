Description:
 A buffer overflow in the fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels_ex() function in
 lib/fribidi-bidi.c of GNU FriBidi through 1.0.7 allows an attacker to cause
 a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code by delivering
 crafted text content to a user, when this content is then rendered by an
 application that uses FriBidi for text layout calculations. Examples
 include any GNOME or GTK+ based application that uses Pango for text
 layout, as this internally uses FriBidi for bidirectional text layout. For
 example, the attacker can construct a crafted text file to be opened in
 GEdit, or a crafted IRC message to be viewed in HexChat.
