Description:
 In Eclipse Mosquito before and including 2.0.5, establishing a connection
 to the mosquitto server without sending data causes the EPOLLOUT event to
 be added, which results excessive CPU consumption. This could be used by a
 malicious actor to perform denial of service type attack. This issue is
 fixed in 2.0.6
