Description:
 The argument parser of the PARTIAL command in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.6 and
 earlier allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a
 certain command ("body[p") that is treated as a different command
 ("body.peek") and causes an index increment error that leads to an
 out-of-bounds memory corruption.
