Description:
 Apache Solr 5.0.0 to Apache Solr 8.3.1 are vulnerable to a Remote Code
 Execution through the VelocityResponseWriter. A Velocity template can be
 provided through Velocity templates in a configset `velocity/` directory or
 as a parameter. A user defined configset could contain renderable,
 potentially malicious, templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled
 by default, but can be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled`
 by defining a response writer with that setting set to `true`. Defining a
 response writer requires configuration API access. Solr 8.4 removed the
 params resource loader entirely, and only enables the configset-provided
 template rendering when the configset is `trusted` (has been uploaded by an
 authenticated user).
