Description:
 curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file
 endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline,
 curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the
 readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases
 cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different
 outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an
 application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as
 denial-of-service.
