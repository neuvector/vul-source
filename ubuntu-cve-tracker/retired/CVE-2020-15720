Description:
 In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not
 enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter
 was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override
 the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the
 pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle
 attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.

Notes:
 avital> The CVE fix changes the API with the potential to break software which
 avital> calls dogtag-pki under certain circumstances. If the fix is backported, the
 avital> freeipa package must also be updated silmitaniously with
 avital> https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa/pull/4820. Additionally, other packages
 avital> which use dogtag-pki must be investigated and updated if needed.
