Description:
 XZ Utils provide a general-purpose data-compression library plus
 command-line tools. In XZ Utils 5.3.3alpha to 5.8.0, the multithreaded .xz
 decoder in liblzma has a bug where invalid input can at least result in a
 crash. The effects include heap use after free and writing to an address
 based on the null pointer plus an offset. Applications and libraries that
 use the lzma_stream_decoder_mt function are affected. The bug has been
 fixed in XZ Utils 5.8.1, and the fix has been committed to the v5.4, v5.6,
 v5.8, and master branches in the xz Git repository. No new release packages
 will be made from the old stable branches, but a standalone patch is
 available that applies to all affected releases.
