Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in the Express response.links function,
 allowing for arbitrary resource injection in the Link header when
 unsanitized data is used.
 
 The issue arises from improper sanitization in `Link` header values, which
 can allow a combination of characters like `,`, `;`, and `<>` to preload
 malicious resources.
 
 This vulnerability is especially relevant for dynamic parameters.
