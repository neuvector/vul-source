Description:
 The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp_proto.c in ntpd in
 NTP 3.x and 4.x before 4.2.8p2 performs state-variable updates upon
 receiving certain invalid packets, which makes it easier for
 man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service (synchronization
 loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer.
