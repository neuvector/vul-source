Description:
 Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received
 request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server
 and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these
 restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code
 indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was not
 fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header
 was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a
 NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child
 process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and
 submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affected
 mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP
 Server 2.4.47 was never released.
