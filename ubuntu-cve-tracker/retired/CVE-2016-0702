Description:
 The MOD_EXP_CTIME_COPY_FROM_PREBUF function in crypto/bn/bn_exp.c in
 OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not properly
 consider cache-bank access times during modular exponentiation, which makes
 it easier for local users to discover RSA keys by running a crafted
 application on the same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim and
 leveraging cache-bank conflicts, aka a "CacheBleed" attack.
