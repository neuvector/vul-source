Description:
 libdbus 1.5.x and earlier, when used in setuid or other privileged programs
 in X.org and possibly other products, allows local users to gain privileges
 and execute arbitrary code via the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment
 variable. NOTE: libdbus maintainers state that this is a vulnerability in
 the applications that do not cleanse environment variables, not in libdbus
 itself: "we do not support use of libdbus in setuid binaries that do not
 sanitize their environment before their first call into libdbus."
