Description:
 In mspack/cab.h in libmspack before 0.8alpha and cabextract before 1.8, the
 CAB block input buffer is one byte too small for the maximal Quantum block,
 leading to an out-of-bounds write.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that cabextract incorrectly handled certain malformed CAB
 files. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause cabextract to crash,
 resulting in a denial of service. 
Notes:
 alexmurray> We released clamav 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1X.04.2 for precise/esm
 alexmurray> and trusty, but subsequently were notified the bundled libmspack is
 alexmurray> not actually vulnerable in this case, as the version of libmspack
 alexmurray> provided had increased the CAB_BLOCKMAX macro to 65535, meaning that
 alexmurray> CAB_INPUTMAX is now 71679, which is impossible to encode in the
 alexmurray> 16-bit cfdata_CompressedSize field of a single block.
