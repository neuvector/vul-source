Description:
 Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a
 Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable
 and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however
 this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads
 are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a
 race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is
 creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the
 buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is
 being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a
 Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free,
 Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT
 has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that
 the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as
 function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an
 attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue
 deserves a CVE.
