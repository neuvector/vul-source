Description:
 Thunderbird ignored the configuration to require STARTTLS security for an
 SMTP connection. A MITM could perform a downgrade attack to intercept
 transmitted messages, or could take control of the authenticated session to
 execute SMTP commands chosen by the MITM. If an unprotected authentication
 method was configured, the MITM could obtain the authentication
 credentials, too. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.2.
