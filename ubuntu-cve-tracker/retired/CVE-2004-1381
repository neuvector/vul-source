Description:
 Firefox before 1.0 and Mozilla before 1.7.5 allow inactive (background)
 tabs to focus on input being entered in the active tab, as originally
 reported using form fields, which allows remote attackers to steal
 sensitive data that is intended for other sites, which could facilitate
 phishing attacks.
