Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.3 and 12.0.1.
 Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
 network access via TLS to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require
 human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks
 of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or
 complete access to all Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability
 applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java
 Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load
 and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely
 on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
 deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
 (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3
 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)
 component in OpenJDK did not properly handle OCSP stapling messages
 during TLS handshake in some situations. An attacker could use this
 to expose sensitive information.
