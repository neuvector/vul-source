Description:
 The WebAdmin interface in TeamSpeak Server 2.0.20.1 allows remote
 authenticated users with the ServerAdmin flag to assign Registered users
 certain privileges, resulting in a privilege set that extends beyond that
 ServerAdmin's own servers, as demonstrated by the (1) AdminAddServer, (2)
 AdminDeleteServer, (3) AdminStartServer, and (4) AdminStopServer
 privileges; and administration of arbitrary virtual servers via a request
 to a .tscmd URI with a modified serverid parameter, as demonstrated by (a)
 add_server.tscmd, (b) ask_delete_server.tscmd, (c) start_server.tscmd, and
 (d) stop_server.tscmd.
