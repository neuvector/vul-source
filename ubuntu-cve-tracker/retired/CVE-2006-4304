Description:
 Buffer overflow in the sppp driver in FreeBSD 4.11 through 6.1, NetBSD 2.0
 through 4.0 beta before 20060823, and OpenBSD 3.8 and 3.9 before 20060902
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic), obtain
 sensitive information, and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted Link
 Control Protocol (LCP) packets with an option length that exceeds the
 overall length, which triggers the overflow in (1) pppoe and (2) ippp. 
 NOTE: this issue was originally incorrectly reported for the ppp driver.
