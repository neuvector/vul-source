Description:
 The nsCSPHostSrc::permits function in dom/security/nsCSPUtils.cpp in
 Mozilla Firefox before 40.0 does not implement the Content Security Policy
 Level 2 exceptions for the blob, data, and filesystem URL schemes during
 wildcard source-expression matching, which might make it easier for remote
 attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by leveraging
 unexpected policy-enforcement behavior.
