 service (daemon crash) via a crafted DNS response with an empty question
 section.

Notes: 
 tyhicks> I believe that this was introduced in v223 by
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/29815b6c608b836cada5e349d06a96b63eaa65f3
 tyhicks> Lennart pointed out in the pull request that systemd-resolved is
  respawned after crashing. Therefore, I've rated this as a low priority.
 tyhicks> systemd-resolved became the default DNS resolver in Zesty and it is
  enabled in Yakkety
 tyhicks> systemd-resolved is not used by default in Xenial. It is spawned if a
  user execs the systemd-resolve utility but that shouldn't impact the system.
