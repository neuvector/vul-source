Description:
 A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup
 user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar
 SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with specific
 arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program mishandles
 the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and
 value are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals
 sign is also supported),
