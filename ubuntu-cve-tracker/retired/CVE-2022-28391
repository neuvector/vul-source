Description:
 BusyBox through 1.35.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code if
 netstat is used to print a DNS PTR record's value to a VT compatible
 terminal. Alternatively, the attacker could choose to change the terminal's
 colors.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> I understand the "fix" introduces memory leaks. This may or may not matter.
 mdeslaur> no upstream patch available as of 2024-11-25.
 mdeslaur> Terminals on Ubuntu shouldn't allow executing arbitrary code
 mdeslaur> because of escape sequences.
 mdeslaur> This vulnerability only exists when busybox is built against
 mdeslaur> musl instead of glibc, so marking as not-affected for Ubuntu.
