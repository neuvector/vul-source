Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in config.c in
 config.cgi in Icinga before 1.4.1, when escape_html_tags is disabled, allow
 remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a JavaScript
 expression, as demonstrated by the onload attribute of a BODY element
 located after a check-host-alive! sequence, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2011-2179.
