Description:
 libcurl's ASN1 parser has this utf8asn1str() function used for parsing an
 ASN.1 UTF-8 string. Itcan detect an invalid field and return error.
 Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte
 localstack buffer.  Most modern malloc implementations detect this error
 and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that
 memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of
 nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the
 `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.
 The most likely outcome of exploting this flaw is a crash, although it
 cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in special
 circumstances.
