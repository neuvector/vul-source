Description:
 The bmp_read_info_header function in bin/jp2/convertbmp.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0
 does not reject headers with a zero biBitCount, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory allocation failure) in the
 opj_image_create function in lib/openjp2/image.c, related to the
 opj_aligned_alloc_n function in opj_malloc.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenJPEG incorrectly handled certain image files. A
 remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
Notes:
 ccdm94> openjpeg is not affected by this issue since the variable which was
 ccdm94> not checked for value 0 is checked in the 1.x versions. The code
 ccdm94> was refactored in versions 2.x, and this check was removed, causing
 ccdm94> the vulnerability. In versions 1.x, variable Info_h.biBitCount is
 ccdm94> checked for values 24 and 8, and if not equal to one of them, the
 ccdm94> converter returns an error message instead of processing the image
 ccdm94> file given as input. In versions 1.x of openjpeg, the function that
 ccdm94> contains similar code to the vulnerable one in versions 2.x can be
 ccdm94> found in file convert.c. The reproducer does not cause the memory
 ccdm94> allocation failure error in versions 1.x.
