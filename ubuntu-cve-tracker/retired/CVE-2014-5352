Description:
 The krb5_gss_process_context_token function in
 lib/gssapi/krb5/process_context_token.c in the libgssapi_krb5 library in
 MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x
 before 1.13.1 does not properly maintain security-context handles, which
 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
 (use-after-free and double free, and daemon crash) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via crafted GSSAPI traffic, as demonstrated by traffic to
 kadmind.
