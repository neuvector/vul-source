Description:
 Tor before 0.2.8.9 and 0.2.9.x before 0.2.9.4-alpha had internal functions
 that were entitled to expect that buf_t data had NUL termination, but the
 implementation of or/buffers.c did not ensure that NUL termination was
 present, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (client, hidden service, relay, or authority crash) via crafted data.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Tor improperly NUL terminated data. An attacker
 could possibly use this to cause a crash and denial of service.
