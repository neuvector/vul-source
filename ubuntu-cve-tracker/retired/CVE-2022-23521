Description:
 Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanism
 to allow defining attributes for paths. These attributes can be defined by
 adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which contains a set of
 file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this
 pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occur
 when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of attributes
 for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. These
 overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be
 part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when
 parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from the
 index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file exists
 in the working tree, the index or both. This integer overflow can result in
 arbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote code execution.
 The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going
 back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this issue.
