Description:
 The default configuration in gnome-screensaver 3.5.4 through 3.6.0 sets the
 AutostartCondition line to fallback mode in the .desktop file, which
 prevents the program from starting automatically after login and allows
 physically proximate attackers to bypass screen locking and access an
 unattended workstation.
