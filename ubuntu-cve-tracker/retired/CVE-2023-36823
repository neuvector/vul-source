Description:
 Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Using carefully
 crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSS
 through Sanitize starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 6.0.2
 when Sanitize is configured to use the built-in "relaxed" config or when
 using a custom config that allows `style` elements and one or more CSS
 at-rules. This could result in cross-site scripting or other undesired
 behavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are rendered in a browser.
 Sanitize 6.0.2 performs additional escaping of CSS in `style` element
 content, which fixes this issue. Users who are unable to upgrade can
 prevent this issue by using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow `style`
 elements, using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow CSS at-rules, or by
 manually escaping the character sequence `</` as `<\/` in `style` element
 content.
