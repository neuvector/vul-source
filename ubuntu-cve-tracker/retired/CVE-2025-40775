Description:
 When an incoming DNS protocol message includes a Transaction Signature
 (TSIG), BIND always checks it.  If the TSIG contains an invalid value in
 the algorithm field, BIND immediately aborts with an assertion failure.
 This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.20.0 through 9.20.8 and 9.21.0 through
 9.21.7.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> in focal and jammy, isc-dhcp uses the bind9-libs package
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
 mdeslaur> only affects 9.20+
