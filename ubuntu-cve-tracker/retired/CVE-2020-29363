Description:
 An issue was discovered in p11-kit 0.23.6 through 0.23.21. A heap-based
 buffer overflow has been discovered in the RPC protocol used by p11-kit
 server/remote commands and the client library. When the remote entity
 supplies a serialized byte array in a CK_ATTRIBUTE, the receiving entity
 may not allocate sufficient length for the buffer to store the deserialized
 value.
