Description:
 Race condition in the symlink function in PHP 5.1.6 and earlier allows
 local users to bypass the open_basedir restriction by using a combination
 of symlink, mkdir, and unlink functions to change the file path after the
 open_basedir check and before the file is opened by the underlying system,
 as demonstrated by symlinking a symlink into a subdirectory, to point to a
 parent directory via .. (dot dot) sequences, and then unlinking the
 resulting symlink.
