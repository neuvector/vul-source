Description:
 Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built on top of
 Flask python framework. In versions prior to 4.1.3 an authenticated Admin
 user could query other users by their salted and hashed passwords strings.
 These filters could be made by using partial hashed password strings. The
 response would not include the hashed passwords, but an attacker could
 infer partial password hashes and their respective users. This issue has
 been fixed in version 4.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this issue.
