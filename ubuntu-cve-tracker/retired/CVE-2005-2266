Description:
 Firefox before 1.0.5 and Mozilla before 1.7.9 allows a child frame to call
 top.focus and other methods in a parent frame, even when the parent is in a
 different domain, which violates the same origin policy and allows remote
 attackers to steal sensitive information such as cookies and passwords from
 web sites whose child frames do not verify that they are in the same domain
 as their parents.
