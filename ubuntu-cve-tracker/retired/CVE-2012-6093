Description:
 The QSslSocket::sslErrors function in Qt before 4.6.5, 4.7.x before 4.7.6,
 4.8.x before 4.8.5, when using certain versions of openSSL, uses an
 "incompatible structure layout" that can read memory from the wrong
 location, which causes Qt to report an incorrect error when certificate
 validation fails and might cause users to make unsafe security decisions to
 accept a certificate.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> this is only an issue in environments where a different version
 mdeslaur> of openssl is loaded at runtime than the one used during
 mdeslaur> compilation. This shouldn't happen on Ubuntu, as it should be
 mdeslaur> using the openssl version in the archive. Downgrading priority
 mdeslaur> to "low".
