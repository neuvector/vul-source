Description:
 Integer overflow in ClamAV 0.88.1 and 0.88.4, and other versions before
 0.88.5, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (scanning
 service crash) and execute arbitrary code via a crafted Portable Executable
 (PE) file that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when less memory is
 allocated than expected.
