Description:
 MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.13.1 incorrectly expects that a
 krb5_read_message data field is represented as a string ending with a '\0'
 character, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service
 (NULL pointer dereference) via a zero-byte version string or (2) cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds read) by omitting the '\0' character,
 related to appl/user_user/server.c and lib/krb5/krb/recvauth.c.
