Description:
 A flaw was found in libssh when using the ChaCha20 cipher with the OpenSSL
 library. If an attacker manages to exhaust the heap space, this error is
 not detected and may lead to libssh using a partially initialized cipher
 context. This occurs because the OpenSSL error code returned aliases with
 the SSH_OK code, resulting in libssh not properly detecting the error
 returned by the OpenSSL library. This issue can lead to undefined behavior,
 including compromised data confidentiality and integrity or crashes.
