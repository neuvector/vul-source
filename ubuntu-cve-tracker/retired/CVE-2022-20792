Description:
 A vulnerability in the regex module used by the signature database load
 module of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) versions 0.104.0 through 0.104.2 and LTS
 version 0.103.5 and prior versions could allow an authenticated, local
 attacker to crash ClamAV at database load time, and possibly gain code
 execution. The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking that may
 result in a multi-byte heap buffer overwflow write. An attacker could
 exploit this vulnerability by placing a crafted CDB ClamAV signature
 database file in the ClamAV database directory. An exploit could allow the
 attacker to run code as the clamav user.
