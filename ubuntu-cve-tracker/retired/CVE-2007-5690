Description:
 Buffer overflow in sethdlc.c in the Asterisk Zaptel 1.4.5.1 might allow
 local users to gain privileges via a long device name (interface name) in
 the ifr_name field.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that the
 application requires root access, so privilege boundaries are not crossed
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 fujitsu> Not a security vulnerability, as the attacker would need to run
 fujitsu> the code as root, so there are no privileges to gain.
 mdeslaur> if it's not an issue, let's ignore this
