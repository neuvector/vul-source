Description:
 It was found that a specially crafted LUKS header could trick cryptsetup
 into disabling encryption during the recovery of the device. An attacker
 with physical access to the medium, such as a flash disk, could use this
 flaw to force a user into permanently disabling the encryption layer of
 that medium.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray| Vulnerability is in the online re-encryption feature which is only
  supported by cryptsetup >= 2.2.0
 mdeslaur> per upstream, the backport to 2.2 would be very problematic and
 mdeslaur> it is suggested that the best option is to disable online
 mdeslaur> reencryption
