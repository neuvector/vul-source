Description:
 A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found
 in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time
 between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can
 abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher
 believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.
