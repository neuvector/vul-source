Description:
 networking.c in Redis before 3.2.7 allows "Cross Protocol Scripting"
 because it lacks a check for POST and Host: strings, which are not valid in
 the Redis protocol (but commonly occur when an attack triggers an HTTP
 request to the Redis TCP port).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Redis incorrectly handled certain HTTP POST
 requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute a Cross
 Protocol Scripting (CAS) attack.
