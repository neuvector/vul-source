Description:
 The lxcDomainGetMemoryParameters method in lxc/lxc_driver.c in libvirt
 1.0.5 through 1.2.0 does not properly check the status of LXC guests when
 reading memory tunables, which allows local users to cause a denial of
 service (NULL pointer dereference and libvirtd crash) via a guest in the
 shutdown status, as demonstrated by the "virsh memtune" command.
