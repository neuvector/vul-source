Description:
 An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application
 tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or
 d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions. The result of the dereference is an application
 crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS
 implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however third party
 applications might call these functions on untrusted data.
