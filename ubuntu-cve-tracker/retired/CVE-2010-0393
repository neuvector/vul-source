Description:
 The _cupsGetlang function, as used by lppasswd.c in lppasswd in CUPS 1.2.2,
 1.3.7, 1.3.9, and 1.4.1, relies on an environment variable to determine the
 file that provides localized message strings, which allows local users to
 gain privileges via a file that contains crafted localization data with
 format string specifiers.
