Description:
 A flaw was found in Samba. It is susceptible to a vulnerability where
 multiple incompatible RPC listeners can be initiated, causing disruptions
 in the AD DC service. When Samba's RPC server experiences a high load or
 unresponsiveness, servers intended for non-AD DC purposes (for example,
 NT4-emulation "classic DCs") can erroneously start and compete for the same
 unix domain sockets. This issue leads to partial query responses from the
 AD DC, causing issues such as "The procedure number is out of range" when
 using tools like Active Directory Users. This flaw allows an attacker to
 disrupt AD DC services.
