Description:
 Rejected reason: ** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs:

 maintainer identified an error in the libyaml fuzzers. It is not possible
 to reproduce nor exploit the issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> golang-goyaml is a go translation of libyaml and shouldn't share
 jdstrand> implementation flaws, but may share design flaws
 sbeattie> as of 2024-04-15, fix has not landed upstream.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> libyaml-libyaml-perl, golang-goyaml, and golang-yaml.v2 are
 mdeslaur> unrelated codebases.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> This appears to be an issue with the fuzzer, not libyaml itself:
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/yaml/libyaml/issues/258#issuecomment-2058613931
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The libyaml project doesn't think this CVE should be. Marking as
 mdeslaur> not-affected.
