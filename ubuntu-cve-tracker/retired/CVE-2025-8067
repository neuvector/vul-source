Description:
 A flaw was found in the Udisks daemon, where it allows unprivileged users
 to create loop devices using the D-BUS system. This is achieved via the
 loop device handler, which handles requests sent through the D-BUS
 interface. As two of the parameters of this handle, it receives the file
 descriptor list and index specifying the file where the loop device should
 be backed. The function itself validates the index value to ensure it isn't
 bigger than the maximum value allowed. However, it fails to validate the
 lower bound, allowing the index parameter to be a negative value. Under
 these circumstances, an attacker can cause the UDisks daemon to crash or
 perform a local privilege escalation by gaining access to files owned by
 privileged users.
