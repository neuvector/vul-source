Description:
 Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0,
 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be
 clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS.
 This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1
 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an
 exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This
 vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by
 determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that
 is unique to each request.
