Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** GMXRC.bash in Gromacs 4.5.1 and earlier places a zero-length
 directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local users to gain
 privileges via a Trojan horse shared library in the current working
 directory.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the GMXLDLIB value is
 always added to the beginning of LD_LIBRARY_PATH at a later point in the
 script.
