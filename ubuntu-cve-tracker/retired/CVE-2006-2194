Description:
 The winbind plugin in pppd for ppp 2.4.4 and earlier does not check the
 return code from the setuid function call, which might allow local users to
 gain privileges by causing setuid to fail, such as exceeding PAM limits for
 the maximum number of user processes, which prevents the winbind NTLM
 authentication helper from dropping privileges.
