Description:
 An XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml's clean module versions
 before 4.6.3. When disabling the safe_attrs_only and forms arguments, the
 Cleaner class does not remove the formaction attribute allowing for JS to
 bypass the sanitizer. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run
 arbitrary JS code on users who interact with incorrectly sanitized HTML.
 This issue is patched in lxml 4.6.3.
