Description:
 Users may be able to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets
 policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when using ephemeral
 containers. The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only
 reference secrets specified in the service accountâ€™s secrets field.
 Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission
 plugin and the `kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets` annotation are
 used together with ephemeral containers.
