Description:
 PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the
 magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks
 via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c,
 sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_main.c.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that PHP allowed the magic_quotes_gpc setting to
 be disabled remotely. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass
 restrictions that could prevent an SQL injection.
Notes: 
 sbeattie> this introduced a regression, see bugs
