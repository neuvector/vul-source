Description:
 ntp-keygen in ntp 4.2.8px before 4.2.8p2-RC2 and 4.3.x before 4.3.12 does
 not generate MD5 keys with sufficient entropy on big endian machines when
 the lowest order byte of the temp variable is between 0x20 and 0x7f and not
 #, which might allow remote attackers to obtain the value of generated MD5
 keys via a brute force attack with the 93 possible keys.
