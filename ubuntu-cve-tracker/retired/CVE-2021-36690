Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A segmentation fault can occur in the sqlite3.exe
 command-line component of SQLite 3.36.0 via the idxGetTableInfo function
 when there is a crafted SQL query. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance
 of this report because a sqlite3.exe user already has full privileges
 (e.g., is intentionally allowed to execute commands). This report does NOT
 imply any problem in the SQLite library.
