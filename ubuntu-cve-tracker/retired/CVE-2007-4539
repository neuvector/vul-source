Description:
 The WebService (XML-RPC) interface in Bugzilla 2.23.3 through 3.0.0 does
 not enforce permissions for the time-tracking fields of bugs, which allows
 remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via certain XML-RPC
 requests, as demonstrated by the (1) Deadline and (2) Estimated Time
 fields.
