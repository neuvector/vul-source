Description:
 The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk Open 1.2.x before 1.2.23,
 1.4.x before 1.4.9, and Asterisk Appliance Developer Kit before 0.6.0, when
 configured to allow unauthenticated calls, allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via a flood of calls that do not
 complete a 3-way handshake, which causes an ast_channel to be allocated but
 not released.
