Description:
 Exim dnsdb Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This
 vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive
 information on affected installations of Exim. Authentication is not
 required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
 smtp service, which listens on TCP port 25 by default. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result
 in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage
 this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in
 the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-17643.
