Description:
 Exim dnsdb Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This
 vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive
 information on affected installations of Exim. Authentication is not
 required to exploit this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the smtp service, which listens on TCP port
 25 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
 user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated
 buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other
 vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the service
 account.
 . Was ZDI-CAN-17643.
