Description:
 A malicious server can use the FTP PASV response to trick curl 7.73.0 and
 earlier into connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way
 potentially make curl extract information about services that are otherwise
 private and not disclosed, for example doing port scanning and service
 banner extractions.
