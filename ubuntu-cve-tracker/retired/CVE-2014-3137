Description:
 Bottle 0.10.x before 0.10.12, 0.11.x before 0.11.7, and 0.12.x before
 0.12.6 does not properly limit content types, which allows remote attackers
 to bypass intended access restrictions via an accepted Content-Type
 followed by a ; (semi-colon) and a Content-Type that would not be accepted,
 as demonstrated in YouCompleteMe to execute arbitrary code.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Bottle does not properly limit content types. A
 remote attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code.
