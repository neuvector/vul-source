Description:
 The bash_completion script for fscrypt allows injection of commands via
 crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific
 set of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths
 could potentially escalate their privileges if they create a malicious
 mountpoint path and if the system administrator happens to be using the
 fscrypt bash completion script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend
 upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above
