Description:
 TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Versions
 prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 are vulnerable to
 Code Injection. Due to the lack of separating user-submitted data from the
 internal configuration in the Form Designer backend module, it is possible
 to inject code instructions to be processed and executed via TypoScript as
 PHP code. The existence of individual TypoScript instructions for a
 particular form item and a valid backend user account with access to the
 form module are needed to exploit this vulnerability. This issue is patched
 in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.
