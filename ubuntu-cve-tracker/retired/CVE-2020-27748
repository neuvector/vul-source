Description:
 A flaw was found in the xdg-email component of xdg-utils-1.1.0-rc1 and
 newer. When handling mailto: URIs, xdg-email allows attachments to be
 discreetly added via the URI when being passed to Thunderbird. An attacker
 could potentially send a victim a URI that automatically attaches a
 sensitive file to a new email. If a victim user does not notice that an
 attachment was added and sends the email, this could result in sensitive
 information disclosure. It has been confirmed that the code behind this
 issue is in xdg-email and not in Thunderbird.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 leosilva> the patch was made in a stable release removing the
 leosilva> functionality of --attach in thuderbird and other applications
 leosilva> we decided to mark it as ignored since it causes regression cross applications.
 leosilva> Also, considers it not as medium since the attach ability requires users permissions.
