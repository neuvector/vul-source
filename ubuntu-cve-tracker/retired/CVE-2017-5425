Description:
 The Gecko Media Plugin sandbox allows access to local files that match
 specific regular expressions. On OS OX, this matching allows access to some
 data in subdirectories of "/private/var" that could expose personal or
 temporary data. This has been updated to not allow access to "/private/var"
 and its subdirectories. Note: this issue only affects OS X. Other operating
 systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 52 and
 Thunderbird < 52.
