Description:
 MaraDNS before 1.3.07.12 and 1.4.x before 1.4.08 computes hash values for
 DNS data without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions
 predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted queries with the Recursion
 Desired (RD) bit set.
