Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Crypto++ (aka Cryptopp) 8.6.0 and earlier contains a timing
 leakage in MakePublicKey(). There is a clear correlation between execution
 time and private key length, which may cause disclosure of the length
 information of the private key. This might allow attackers to conduct
 timing attacks. NOTE: this report is disputed by the vendor and multiple
 third parties. The execution-time differences are intentional. A user may
 make a choice of a longer key as a tradeoff between strength and
 performance. In making this choice, the amount of information leaked to an
 adversary is of infinitesimal value.
