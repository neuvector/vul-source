Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to
 cause a host OS crash because of incorrect error handling in event-channel
 port allocation. The allocation of an event-channel port may fail for
 multiple reasons: (1) port is already in use, (2) the memory allocation
 failed, or (3) the port we try to allocate is higher than what is supported
 by the ABI (e.g., 2L or FIFO) used by the guest or the limit set by an
 administrator (max_event_channels in xl cfg). Due to the missing error
 checks, only (1) will be considered an error. All the other cases will
 provide a valid port and will result in a crash when trying to access the
 event channel. When the administrator configured a guest to allow more than
 1023 event channels, that guest may be able to crash the host. When Xen is
 out-of-memory, allocation of new event channels will result in crashing the
 host rather than reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later are
 affected. All architectures are affected. The default configuration, when
 guests are created with xl/libxl, is not vulnerable, because of the default
 event-channel limit.
