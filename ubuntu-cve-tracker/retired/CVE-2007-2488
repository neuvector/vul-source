Description:
 The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk before 20070504 does not
 properly null terminate data, which allows remote attackers to trigger loss
 of transmitted data, and possibly obtain sensitive information (memory
 contents) or cause a denial of service (application crash), by sending a
 frame that lacks a 0 byte.
