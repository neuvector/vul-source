Description:
 Information exposure through microarchitectural state after transient
 execution from some register files for some Intel(R) Atom(R) Processors may
 allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure
 via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that some Intel® Atom® Processors did not properly clear
 register state when performing various operations. A local attacker could
 use this to obtain sensitive information via a transient execution attack.
