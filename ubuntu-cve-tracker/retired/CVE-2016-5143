Description:
 The Developer Tools (aka DevTools) subsystem in Blink, as used in Google
 Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, mishandles the script-path hostname,
 remoteBase parameter, and remoteFrontendUrl parameter, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted URL, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2016-5144.
