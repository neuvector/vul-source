Description:
 lighttpd before 1.4.54 has a signed integer overflow, which might allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a malicious HTTP GET request, as
 demonstrated by mishandling of /%2F? in burl_normalize_2F_to_slash_fix in
 burl.c. NOTE: The developer states "The feature which can be abused to
 cause the crash is a new feature in lighttpd 1.4.50, and is not enabled by
 default. It must be explicitly configured in the config file (e.g.
 lighttpd.conf). Certain input will trigger an abort() in lighttpd when that
 feature is enabled. lighttpd detects the underflow or realloc() will fail
 (in both 32-bit and 64-bit executables), also detected in lighttpd. Either
 triggers an explicit abort() by lighttpd. This is not exploitable beyond
 triggering the explicit abort() with subsequent application exit.
