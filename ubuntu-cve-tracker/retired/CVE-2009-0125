Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the upstream vendor.
 nasl/nasl_crypto2.c in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language library (aka
 libnasl) 2.2.11 does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL
 DSA_do_verify function, which allows remote attackers to bypass validation
 of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar
 vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.  NOTE: the upstream vendor has disputed
 this issue, stating "while we do misuse this function (this is a bug), it
 has absolutely no security ramification."
