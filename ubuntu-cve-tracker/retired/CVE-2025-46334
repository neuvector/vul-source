Description:
 Git GUI allows you to use the Git source control management tools via a
 GUI. A malicious repository can ship versions of sh.exe or typical textconv
 filter programs such as astextplain. Due to the unfortunate design of Tcl
 on Windows, the search path when looking for an executable always includes
 the current directory. The mentioned programs are invoked when the user
 selects Git Bash or Browse Files from the menu. This vulnerability is fixed
 in 2.43.7, 2.44.4, 2.45.4, 2.46.4, 2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1, and 2.50.1.
