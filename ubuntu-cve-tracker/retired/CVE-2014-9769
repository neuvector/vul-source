Description:
 pcre_jit_compile.c in PCRE 8.35 does not properly use table jumps to
 optimize nested alternatives, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (stack memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted string, as demonstrated by packets encountered
 by Suricata during use of a regular expression in an Emerging Threats Open
 ruleset.
