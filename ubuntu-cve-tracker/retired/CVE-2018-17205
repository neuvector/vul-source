Description:
 An issue was discovered in Open vSwitch (OvS) 2.7.x through 2.7.6,
 affecting ofproto_rule_insert__ in ofproto/ofproto.c. During bundle commit,
 flows that are added in a bundle are applied to ofproto in order. If a flow
 cannot be added (e.g., the flow action is a go-to for a group id that does
 not exist), OvS tries to revert back all previous flows that were
 successfully applied from the same bundle. This is possible since OvS
 maintains list of old flows that were replaced by flows from the bundle.
 While reinserting old flows, OvS has an assertion failure due to a check on
 rule state != RULE_INITIALIZED. This would work for new flows, but for an
 old flow the rule state is RULE_REMOVED. The assertion failure causes an
 OvS crash.
