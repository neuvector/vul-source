Description:
 Vim is an open source command line text editor. When performing a search
 and displaying the search-count message is disabled (:set shm+=S), the
 search pattern is displayed at the bottom of the screen in a buffer
 (msgbuf). When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled, the search pattern is
 reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern
 contains some ASCII NUL characters, the buffer allocated will be smaller
 than the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed
 buffer, the strlen() function is called, which only counts until it notices
 an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is wrong. This
 causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by the
 previously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. The issue has been fixed as of
 Vim patch v9.1.0689.
