Description:
 MySQL 5.0.51a allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by
 calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or
 (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are associated with symlinks within
 pathnames for subdirectories of the MySQL home data directory, which are
 followed when tables are created in the future. NOTE: this vulnerability
 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2079.
