Description:
 In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, and
 greater than or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, in a case where an
 attacker manages to generate a valid cryptographic message authentication
 code (HMAC-SHA1) - either by using a different existing vulnerability or in
 case the internal encryptionKey was exposed - it is possible to retrieve
 arbitrary files of a TYPO3 installation. This includes the possibility to
 fetch typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php, which again contains the
 encryptionKey as well as credentials of the database management system
 being used. In case a database server is directly accessible either via
 internet or in a shared hosting network, this allows the ability to
 completely retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents. This includes
 creating an administration user account - which can be used to trigger
 remote code execution by injecting custom extensions. This has been patched
 in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.
