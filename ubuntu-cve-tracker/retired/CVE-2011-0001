Description:
 Double free vulnerability in the iscsi_rx_handler function
 (usr/iscsi/iscsid.c) in the tgt daemon (tgtd) in Linux SCSI target
 framework (tgt) before 1.0.14, aka scsi-target-utils, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to a buffer
 overflow during iscsi login. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
 third party information.
