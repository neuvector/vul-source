Description:
 An issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.5 LTS, 6.1.x and 6.2.x
 before 6.2.2, and 6.3.x before 6.3.1. It does not clear a pointer between
 the handling of one client request and the next request within the same
 connection. This sometimes causes information to be disclosed from the
 connection workspace, such as data structures associated with previous
 requests within this connection or VCL-related temporary headers.
