Description:
 Transmission through 2.92 relies on X-Transmission-Session-Id (which is not
 a forbidden header for Fetch) for access control, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary RPC commands, and consequently write to
 arbitrary files, via POST requests to /transmission/rpc in conjunction with
 a DNS rebinding attack.
