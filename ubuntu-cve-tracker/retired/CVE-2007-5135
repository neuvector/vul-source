Description:
 Off-by-one error in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function in OpenSSL 0.9.7 up
 to 0.9.7l, and 0.9.8 up to 0.9.8f, might allow remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted packet that triggers a one-byte buffer
 underflow.  NOTE: this issue was introduced as a result of a fix for
 CVE-2006-3738.  As of 20071012, it is unknown whether code execution is
 possible.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Moritz Jodeit discovered that OpenSSL's SSL_get_shared_ciphers function
 did not correctly check the size of the buffer it was writing to.
 A remote attacker could exploit this to write one NULL byte past the end of
 an application's cipher list buffer, possibly leading to arbitrary code
 execution or a denial of service.
