Description:
 Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight
 themes by manipulating the "baseURI" property of the theme element. This
 could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction
 which could contain offensive or embarrassing images. This vulnerability
 affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and
 Firefox ESR < 52.8.
