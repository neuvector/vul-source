Notes:
 ccdm94> there is no explicit information mentioning what is the 
 ccdm94> patch for this CVE, but it looks like it might have been
 ccdm94> fixed together with other issues in commit b9ab2a9d36a, 
 ccdm94> according to the comment in the NEWS file. This is the commit
 ccdm94> that patches CVE-2017-18198. No other changes made to the
 ccdm94> to the code seem to be related to this vulnerability other
 ccdm94> than e73a8bb23a4, which looks like an initial version of
 ccdm94> something improved by commit b9ab2a9d36a. Commit e73a8bb23a4
 ccdm94> fixes issue 52091 which is very similar to the issue that is
 ccdm94> CVE-2017-18198. CVE-2017-18199 involves code that is closely
 ccdm94> related to the code that is affected by CVE-2017-18198, and
 ccdm94> further research indicates that the POC for this latter CVE
 ccdm94> no longer causes a crash when commit e73a8bb23a4 is applied,
 ccdm94> so it is adequate to assume that it fixes CVE-2017-18199 and
 ccdm94> that commit b9ab2a9d36a, the improved version of e73a8bb23a4,
 ccdm94> does so as well.
