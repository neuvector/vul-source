Description:
 The NFS client implementation in the kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
 (RHEL) 3, when a filesystem is mounted with the noacl option, checks
 permissions for the open system call via vfs_permission (mode bits) data
 rather than an NFS ACCESS call to the server, which allows local client
 processes to obtain a false success status from open calls that the server
 would deny, and possibly obtain sensitive information about file
 permissions on the server, as demonstrated in a root_squash environment. 
 NOTE: it is uncertain whether any scenarios involving this issue cross
 privilege boundaries.
