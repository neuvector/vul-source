Description:
 The g_markup_escape_text function in the SILC protocol plug-in in libpurple
 2.10.0 and earlier, as used in Pidgin and possibly other products, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via invalid UTF-8
 sequences that trigger use of invalid pointers and an out-of-bounds read,
 related to interactions with certain versions of glib2.
