Description:
 Atril Document Viewer is the default document reader of the MATE desktop
 environment for Linux. A path traversal and arbitrary file write
 vulnerability exists in versions of Atril prior to 1.26.2. This
 vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the
 filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access. The
 only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite
 existing files, but that doesn't stop an attacker from achieving Remote
 Command Execution on the target system. Version 1.26.2 of Atril contains a
 patch for this vulnerability.
