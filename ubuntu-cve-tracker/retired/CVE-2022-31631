Description:
 A flaw was found in PHP. This issue occurs due to an uncaught integer overflow in PDO::quote()
 of PDO_SQLite returning an improperly quoted string. With the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf(),
 it is possible to force the function to return a single apostrophe if the function is called on
 user-supplied input without any length restrictions in place.
