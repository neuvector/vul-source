Description:
 A flaw was found in the solaris_zone module from the Ansible Community
 modules. When setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone
 name is checked by listing the process with the 'ps' bare command on the
 remote machine. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting
 the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the remote host.
 Ansible Engine 2.7.15, 2.8.7, and 2.9.2 as well as previous versions are
 affected.
