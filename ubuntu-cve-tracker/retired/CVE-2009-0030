Description:
 A certain Red Hat patch for SquirrelMail 1.4.8 sets the same SQMSESSID
 cookie value for all sessions, which allows remote authenticated users to
 access other users' folder lists and configuration data in opportunistic
 circumstances by using the standard webmail.php interface.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2008-3663.
