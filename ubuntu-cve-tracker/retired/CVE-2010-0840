Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in
 Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, and
 1.4.2_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and
 availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was
 obtained from the March 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from
 a reliable researcher that this is related to improper checks when
 executing privileged methods in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which
 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) an untrusted object that
 extends the trusted class but has not modified a certain method, or (2) "a
 similar trust issue with interfaces," aka "Trusted Methods Chaining Remote
 Code Execution Vulnerability."
