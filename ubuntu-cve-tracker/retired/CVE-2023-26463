Description:
 strongSwan 5.9.8 and 5.9.9 potentially allows remote code execution because
 it uses a variable named "public" for two different purposes within the
 same function. There is initially incorrect access control, later followed
 by an expired pointer dereference. One attack vector is sending an
 untrusted client certificate during EAP-TLS. A server is affected only if
 it loads plugins that implement TLS-based EAP methods (EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS,
 EAP-PEAP, or EAP-TNC). This is fixed in 5.9.10.
