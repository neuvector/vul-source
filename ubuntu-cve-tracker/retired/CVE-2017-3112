Description:
 An issue was discovered in Adobe Flash Player 27.0.0.183 and earlier
 versions. This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads
 data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is part of
 AdobePSDK metadata. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset
 during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A
 successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.
