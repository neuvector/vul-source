Description:
 DenyHosts 2.6 does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows remote
 attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file and cause a
 denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the sshd log file, as
 demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a client protocol version
 identification containing an IP address string, a different vector than
 CVE-2006-6301.
