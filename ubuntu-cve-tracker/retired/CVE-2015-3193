Description:
 The Montgomery squaring implementation in crypto/bn/asm/x86_64-mont5.pl in
 OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e on the x86_64 platform, as used by the
 BN_mod_exp function, mishandles carry propagation and produces incorrect
 output, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 private-key information via an attack against use of a (1) Diffie-Hellman
 (DH) or (2) Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) ciphersuite.
