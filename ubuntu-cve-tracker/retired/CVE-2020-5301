Description:
 SimpleSAMLphp versions before 1.18.6 contain an information disclosure
 vulnerability. The module controller in `SimpleSAML\Module` that processes
 requests for pages hosted by modules, has code to identify paths ending
 with `.php` and process those as PHP code. If no other suitable way of
 handling the given path exists it presents the file to the browser. The
 check to identify paths ending with `.php` does not account for uppercase
 letters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the server
 is serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on
 Windows, the processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code
 is instead presented to the browser. An attacker may use this issue to gain
 access to the source code in third-party modules that is meant to be
 private, or even sensitive. However, the attack surface is considered
 small, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp serves such content
 from a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on Windows. This
 issue is fixed in version 1.18.6.
