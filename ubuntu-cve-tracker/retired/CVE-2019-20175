Description:
 An issue was discovered in ide_dma_cb() in hw/ide/core.c in QEMU 2.4.0
 through 4.2.0. The guest system can crash the QEMU process in the host
 system via a special SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND. It hits an assertion that
 implies that the size of successful DMA transfers there must be a multiple
 of 512 (the size of a sector). NOTE: a member of the QEMU security team
 disputes the significance of this issue because a "privileged guest user
 has many ways to cause similar DoS effect, without triggering this assert.
