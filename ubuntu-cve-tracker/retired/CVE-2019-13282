Description:
 In Xpdf 4.01.01, a heap-based buffer over-read could be triggered in
 SampledFunction::transform in Function.cc when using a large index for
 samples. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF
 document to the pdftotext tool. It allows an attacker to use a crafted pdf
 file to cause Denial of Service or an information leak, or possibly have
 unspecified other impact.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> xpdf in koffice is 2.0
 ebarretto> since 0.5.12-1 libextractor does not use xpdf anymore.
 ebarretto> xpdf in Debian uses poppler, which is not affected or fixed
