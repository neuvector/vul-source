Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service by opening multiple tabs in a popup window.  NOTE: this issue has
 been disputed by third party researchers, stating that "this does not crash
 on me, and I can't see a likely mechanism of action that would lead to a
 DoS condition.
