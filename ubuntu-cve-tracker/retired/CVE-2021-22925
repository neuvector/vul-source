Description:
 curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as
 `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS`in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send
 variable=content pairs toTELNET servers.Due to flaw in the option parser
 for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurlcould be made to pass on
 uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to theserver. Therefore
 potentially revealing sensitive internal information to theserver using a
 clear-text network protocol.This could happen because curl did not call and
 use sscanf() correctly whenparsing the string provided by the application.
