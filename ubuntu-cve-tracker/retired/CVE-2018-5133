Description:
 If the "app.support.baseURL" preference is changed by a malicious local
 program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized.
 It will be executed if a user loads
 "chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul" directly
 in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed
 whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a
 notification message. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.
