Description:
 The (1) python-vm-builder and (2) ubuntu-vm-builder implementations in
 VMBuilder 0.9 in Ubuntu 8.10 omit the -e option when invoking chpasswd with
 a root:! argument, which configures the root account with a cleartext
 password of ! (exclamation point) and allows attackers to bypass intended
 login restrictions.
