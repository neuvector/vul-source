Description:
 A null pointer dereference issue was found in Libtiff's tif_dir.c file.
 This issue may allow an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to the
 tiffcp utility which triggers a runtime error that causes undefined
 behavior. This will result in an application crash, eventually leading to a
 denial of service.
