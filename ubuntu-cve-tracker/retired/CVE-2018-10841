Description:
 glusterfs is vulnerable to privilege escalation on gluster server nodes. An
 authenticated gluster client via TLS could use gluster cli with
 --remote-host command to add it self to trusted storage pool and perform
 privileged gluster operations like adding other machines to trusted storage
 pool, start, stop, and delete volumes.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled user permissions. An
 authenticated attacker could possibly use this to add himself to trusted
 storage pool and performing privileged operations on volumes.
