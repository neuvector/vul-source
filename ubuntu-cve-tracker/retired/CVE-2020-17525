Description:
 Subversion's mod_authz_svn module will crash if the server is using
 in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile option
 and a client sends a request for a non-existing repository URL. This can
 lead to disruption for users of the service. This issue was fixed in
 mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn servers 1.14.1 and mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn
 servers 1.10.7
Ubuntu-Description:
 Thomas Åkesson discovered that Subversion incorrectly handled certain
 inputs. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
 service.
