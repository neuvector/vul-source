Description:
 The ssl3_get_record function in ssl/s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through
 0.9.8m allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
 malformed record in a TLS connection that triggers a NULL pointer
 dereference, related to the minor version number.  NOTE: some of these
 details are obtained from third party information.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> according to upstream, if 'short' is a 16-bit integer, this issue
  applies only to OpenSSL 0.9.8m, otherwise it affects 0.9.8f through 0.9.8m.
  Confirmed that on all releases of Ubuntu on all architectures that 'short' is
  2 bytes. (8.10/sparc and 10.04/armel could not be checked)
