Description:
 The
  “socket” module provides a pure-Python fallback to the
 socket.socketpair() function for platforms that don’t support AF_UNIX,
 such as Windows. This pure-Python implementation uses AF_INET or
 AF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. The connection
 between the two sockets was not verified before passing the two sockets
 back to the user, which leaves the server socket vulnerable to a
 connection race from a malicious local peer.
 
 Platforms that support AF_UNIX such as Linux and macOS are not affected by
 this vulnerability. Versions prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due to
 the vulnerable API not being included.
