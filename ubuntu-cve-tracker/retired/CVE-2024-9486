Description:
 A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder versions <=
 v0.1.37 where default credentials are enabled during the image build
 process. Virtual machine images built using the Proxmox provider do not
 disable these default credentials, and nodes using the resulting images may
 be accessible via these default credentials. The credentials can be used to
 gain root access. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their nodes use
 VM images created via the Image Builder project with its Proxmox provider.
