Description:
 lxsession-logout in lxsession in LXDE, as used on SUSE openSUSE 11.3 and
 other platforms, does not lock the screen when the Suspend or Hibernate
 button is pressed, which might make it easier for physically proximate
 attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume action. NOTE: there
 is no general agreement that this is a vulnerability, because separate
 control over locking can be an equally secure, or more secure, behavior in
 some threat environments.
