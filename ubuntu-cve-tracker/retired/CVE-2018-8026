Description:
 This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.4 and 7.0.0 to 7.3.1 relates
 to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files
 (currency.xml, enumsConfig.xml referred from schema.xml, TIKA parsecontext
 config file). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config
 files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as
 XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files
 from the Solr server or the internal network. The manipulated files can be
 uploaded as configsets using Solr's API, allowing to exploit that
 vulnerability.
