Description:
 A flaw was found in libvirt. A refactor of the code fetching the list of
 interfaces for multiple APIs introduced a corner case on platforms where
 allocating 0 bytes of memory results in a NULL pointer. This corner case
 would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent crash of
 virtinterfaced. This issue could allow clients connecting to the read-only
 socket to crash the virtinterfaced daemon.
