Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. In versions prior to 2.2.19,
 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, `Rack::Multipart::Parser` can accumulate unbounded data
 when a multipart part’s header block never terminates with the required
 blank line (`CRLFCRLF`). The parser keeps appending incoming bytes to
 memory without a size cap, allowing a remote attacker to exhaust memory and
 cause a denial of service (DoS). Attackers can send incomplete multipart
 headers to trigger high memory use, leading to process termination (OOM) or
 severe slowdown. The effect scales with request size limits and
 concurrency. All applications handling multipart uploads may be affected.
 Versions 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2 cap per-part header size (e.g., 64 KiB).
 As a workaround, restrict maximum request sizes at the proxy or web server
 layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`).
