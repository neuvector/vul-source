Description:
 It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0
 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows
 attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the
 logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a
 Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map
 pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI
 Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution
 in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j
 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for
 message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.
