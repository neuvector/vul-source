Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the evbuffer API in Libevent 2.0.x before
 2.0.22 and 2.1.x before 2.1.5-beta allow context-dependent attackers to
 cause a denial of service or possibly have other unspecified impact via
 "insanely large inputs" to the (1) evbuffer_add, (2) evbuffer_prepend, (3)
 evbuffer_expand, (4) exbuffer_reserve_space, or (5) evbuffer_read function,
 which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow or an infinite loop.  NOTE:
 this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2014-6272 per ADT3 due to different
 affected versions.
