Description:
 In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function (in
 der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8
 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information from other
 memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that LibTomCrypt incorrectly handled certain inputs. An
 attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or read
 sensitive information.
