Description:
 libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or
 SSHrelated option had been changed that should have prohibited
 reuse.libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
 subsequenttransfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
 several TLS andSSH settings were left out from the configuration match
 checks, making themmatch too easily.
