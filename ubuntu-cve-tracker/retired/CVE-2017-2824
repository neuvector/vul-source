Description:

 can cause a command injection resulting in remote code execution. An
 attacker can make requests from an active Zabbix Proxy to trigger this
 vulnerability.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Zabbix incorrectly handled certain requests. A remote
 attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.
