Description:
 In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the file
 type when extracting a snap. The snap format is a squashfs file-system
 image and so can contain files that are non-regular files (such as pipes
 or sockets etc). Various file entries within the snap squashfs image
 (such as icons etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An
 attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which
 contained non-regular files at these paths could then cause snapd to block
 indefinitely trying to read from such files and cause a denial of service.
