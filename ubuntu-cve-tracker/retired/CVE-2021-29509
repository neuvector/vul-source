Description:
 Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix
 for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing
 connections that had already been accepted from having their requests
 starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same
 process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy
 persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the
 cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive`
 connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service
 only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections.
 This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting
 `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using
 `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you
 will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very
 small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of
 Puma.
