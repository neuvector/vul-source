Description:
 libcurl's URL API function
 [curl_url_get()](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_url_get.html) offers
 punycode
 conversions, to and from IDN. Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256
 bytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built
 to
 use the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up the
 provided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string.
 
 This flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part of
 the converted string.
