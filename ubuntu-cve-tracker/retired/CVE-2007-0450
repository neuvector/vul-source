Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server and Tomcat 5.x
 before 5.5.22 and 6.x before 6.0.10, when using certain proxy modules
 (mod_proxy, mod_rewrite, mod_jk), allows remote attackers to read arbitrary
 files via a .. (dot dot) sequence with combinations of (1) "/" (slash), (2)
 "\" (backslash), and (3) URL-encoded backslash (%5C) characters in the URL,
 which are valid separators in Tomcat but not in Apache.
