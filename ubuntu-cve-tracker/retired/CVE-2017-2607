Description:
 jenkins before versions 2.44, 2.32.2 is vulnerable to a persisted
 cross-site scripting vulnerability in console notes (SECURITY-382). Jenkins
 allows plugins to annotate build logs, adding new content or changing the
 presentation of existing content while the build is running. Malicious
 Jenkins users, or users with SCM access, could configure jobs or modify
 build scripts such that they print serialized console notes that perform
 cross-site scripting attacks on Jenkins users viewing the build logs.

 To prevent this, console notes are now signed by Jenkins when
 created, and Jenkins will only deserialize correctly signed console
 notes. As a side effect, console notes created before updating to
 a release containing this fix will no longer be deserialized. To
 restore the previous (unsafe) behavior, set the system property
 hudson.console.ConsoleNote.INSECURE to true as described on Features
 controlled by system properties.
