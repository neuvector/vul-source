Description:
 Processing of repeated responses to the same query, where both responses
 contain ECS pseudo-options, but where the first is broken in some way, can
 cause BIND to exit with an assertion failure. 'Broken' in this context is
 anything that would cause the resolver to reject the query response, such
 as a mismatch between query and answer name. This issue affects BIND 9
 versions 9.11.4-S1 through 9.11.37-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.
