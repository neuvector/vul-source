Description:
 ld.so in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.11.3, and 2.12.x
 before 2.12.2, does not properly restrict use of the LD_AUDIT environment
 variable to reference dynamic shared objects (DSOs) as audit objects, which
 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging an unsafe DSO located
 in a trusted library directory, as demonstrated by libpcprofile.so.
