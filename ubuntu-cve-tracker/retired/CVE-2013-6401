Description:
 Jansson, possibly 2.4 and earlier, does not restrict the ability to trigger
 hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to
 cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted JSON document.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Florian Weimer discovered that Jansson incorrectly handled hash
 collisions predictability. An attacker could possibly use this issue to
 cause a denial of service.
