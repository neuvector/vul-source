Description:
 certain VT-d IOMMUs may not work in shared page table mode For efficiency
 reasons, address translation control structures (page tables) may (and, on
 suitable hardware, by default will) be shared between CPUs, for
 second-level translation (EPT), and IOMMUs. These page tables are presently
 set up to always be 4 levels deep. However, an IOMMU may require the use of
 just 3 page table levels. In such a configuration the lop level table needs
 to be stripped before inserting the root table's address into the hardware
 pagetable base register. When sharing page tables, Xen erroneously skipped
 this stripping. Consequently, the guest is able to write to leaf page table
 entries.
