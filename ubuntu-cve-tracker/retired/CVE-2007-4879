Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before Firefox 2.0.0.13, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.9, can
 automatically install TLS client certificates with minimal user
 interaction, and automatically sends these certificates when requested,
 which makes it easier for remote web sites to track user activities across
 domains by requesting the TLS client certificates from other domains.
