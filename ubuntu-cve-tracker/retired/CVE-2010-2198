Description:
 lib/fsm.c in RPM 4.8.0 and earlier does not properly reset the metadata of
 an executable file during replacement of the file in an RPM package upgrade
 or deletion of the file in an RPM package removal, which might allow local
 users to gain privileges or bypass intended access restrictions by creating
 a hard link to a vulnerable file that has (1) POSIX file capabilities or
 (2) SELinux context information, a related issue to CVE-2010-2059.
