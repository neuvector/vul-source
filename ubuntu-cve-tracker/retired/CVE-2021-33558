Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Boa 0.94.13 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information via a misconfiguration involving backup.html, preview.html,
 js/log.js, log.html, email.html, online-users.html, and config.js. NOTE:
 multiple third parties report that this is a site-specific issue because
 those files are not part of Boa.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> I believe this just means there's no limits on who can access
  those files. I didn't find better descriptions elsewhere, and it looks like
  a dead project.
