Description:
 The Program::getUniformInternal function in Program.cpp in libANGLE, as
 used in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.108, does not properly handle a
 certain data-type mismatch, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 crafted shader stages.
