Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions,
 allowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound
 runtime configuration. If a process can connect over localhost to port
 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows
 an unprivileged attacker to manipulate a running instance, potentially
 altering forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the
 local resolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether.
