Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in MyDNS 1.1.0 allow remote attackers to (1)
 cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
 code via a certain update, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in
 update.c; and (2) cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via unspecified
 vectors that trigger an off-by-one stack-based buffer overflow in update.c.
