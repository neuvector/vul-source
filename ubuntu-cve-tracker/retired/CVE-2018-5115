Description:
 If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network
 request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded
 foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the
 request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of
 the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private
 credential information to a third party site. This vulnerability affects
 Firefox < 58.
