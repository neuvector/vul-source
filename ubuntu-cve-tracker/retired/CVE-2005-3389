Description:
 The parse_str function in PHP 4.x up to 4.4.0 and 5.x up to 5.0.5, when
 called with only one parameter, allows remote attackers to enable the
 register_globals directive via inputs that cause a request to be terminated
 due to the memory_limit setting, which causes PHP to set an internal flag
 that enables register_globals and allows attackers to exploit
 vulnerabilities in PHP applications that would otherwise be protected.
