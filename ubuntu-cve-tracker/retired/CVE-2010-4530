Description:
 Signedness error in ccid_serial.c in libccid in the USB Chip/Smart Card
 Interface Devices (CCID) driver, as used in pcscd in PCSC-Lite 1.5.3 and
 possibly other products, allows physically proximate attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a smart card with a crafted serial number that causes a
 negative value to be used in a memcpy operation, which triggers a buffer
 overflow.  NOTE: some sources refer to this issue as an integer overflow.
