Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 45.0 does not properly restrict the availability of
 IFRAME Resource Timing API times, which allows remote attackers to bypass
 the Same Origin Policy and obtain sensitive information via crafted
 JavaScript code that leverages history.back and performance.getEntries
 calls after restoring a browser session. NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-7207.
