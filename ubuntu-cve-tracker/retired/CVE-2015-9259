Description:
 In Docker Notary before 0.1, the checkRoot function in
 gotuf/client/client.go does not check expiry of root.json files, despite a
 comment stating that it does. Even if a user creates a new root.json file
 after a key compromise, an attacker can produce update files referring to
 an old root.json file.
