Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in
 b2evolution allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL
 in the (1) inc_path parameter to (a) a_noskin.php, (b) a_stub.php, (c)
 admin.php, (d) contact.php, (e) default.php, (f) index.php, and (g)
 multiblogs.php in blogs/; the (2) view_path and (3) control_path parameters
 to blogs/admin.php; and the (4) skins_path parameter to (h)
 blogs/contact.php and (i) blogs/multiblogs.php.  NOTE: this issue is
 disputed by CVE, since the inc_path, view_path, control_path, and
 skins_path variables are all initialized in conf/_advanced.php before they
 are used.
