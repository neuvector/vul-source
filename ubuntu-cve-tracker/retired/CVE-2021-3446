Description:
 A flaw was found in libtpms in versions before 0.8.2. The commonly used
 integration of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability related to
 the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric ciphers were
 used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to the
 caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption and decryption steps. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
