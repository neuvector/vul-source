Description:
 In BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.21, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -> 9.17.3, also affects
 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.21-S1 of the BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, An attacker
 on the network path for a TSIG-signed request, or operating the server
 receiving the TSIG-signed request, could send a truncated response to that
 request, triggering an assertion failure, causing the server to exit.
 Alternately, an off-path attacker would have to correctly guess when a
 TSIG-signed request was sent, along with other characteristics of the
 packet and message, and spoof a truncated response to trigger an assertion
 failure, causing the server to exit.
