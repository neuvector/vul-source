Description:
 A buffer overflow can occur in the Skia library during buffer offset
 calculations with hardware accelerated canvas 2D actions due to the use of
 32-bit calculations instead of 64-bit. This results in a potentially
 exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.4, Firefox
 ESR < 60.4, and Firefox < 64.
