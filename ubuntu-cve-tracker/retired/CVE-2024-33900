Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** KeePassXC 2.7.7 allows an attacker (who has the privileges
 of the victim) to recover cleartext credentials via a memory dump. NOTE:
 the vendor disputes this because memory-management constraints make this
 unavoidable in the current design and other realistic designs.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> This vulnerability requires the attacker to dump the memory of
  the keepassxc process - in Ubuntu the default ptrace restrictions ensure
  that in general this cannot be done by other processes even belonging to
  the same user which lowers the severity of this vulnerability
Mitigation:
Bugs:
Priority: low
 Mitigated by default ptrace restrictions in Ubuntu
