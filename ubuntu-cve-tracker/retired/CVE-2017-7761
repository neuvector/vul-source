Description:
 The Mozilla Maintenance Service "helper.exe" application creates a
 temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined
 with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in
 the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla
 Maintenance Service, which has privileged access. Note: This attack
 requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating
 systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.2 and
 Firefox < 54.
