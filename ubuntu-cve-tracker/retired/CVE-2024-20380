Description:
 A vulnerability in the HTML parser of ClamAV could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
 condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an issue in
 the C to Rust foreign function interface. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing HTML content to be
 scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. An exploit could allow the
 attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a
 DoS condition on the affected software.
