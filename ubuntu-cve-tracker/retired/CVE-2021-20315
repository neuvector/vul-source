Description:
 A locking protection bypass flaw was found in some versions of gnome-shell
 as shipped within CentOS Stream 8, when the "Application menu" or "Window
 list" GNOME extensions are enabled. This flaw allows a physical attacker
 who has access to a locked system to kill existing applications and start
 new ones as the locked user, even if the session is still locked.
