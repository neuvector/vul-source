Description:
 A flaw was found in ansible-runner. An improper escaping of the shell
 command, while calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead
 to parameters getting executed as host's shell command. A developer could
 unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the
 virtual environment.
