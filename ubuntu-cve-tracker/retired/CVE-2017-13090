Description:
 The retr.c:fd_read_body() function is called when processing OK responses.
 When the response is sent chunked in wget before 1.19.2, the chunk parser
 uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that the chunk
 length is a non-negative number. The code then tries to read the chunk in
 pieces of 8192 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing the
 negative chunk length to retr.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int
 argument, the high 32 bits of the chunk length are discarded, leaving
 fd_read() with a completely attacker controlled length argument. The
 attacker can corrupt malloc metadata after the allocated buffer.
