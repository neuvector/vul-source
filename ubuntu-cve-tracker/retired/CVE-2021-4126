Description:
 When receiving an OpenPGP/MIME signed email message that contains an
 additional outer MIME message layer, for example a message footer added by
 a mailing list gateway, Thunderbird only considered the inner signed
 message for the signature validity. This gave the false impression that the
 additional contents were also covered by the digital signature. Starting
 with Thunderbird version 91.4.1, only the signature that belongs to the top
 level MIME part will be considered for the displayed status. This
 vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.1.
