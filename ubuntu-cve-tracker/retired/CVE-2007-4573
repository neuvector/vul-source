Description:
 The IA32 system call emulation functionality in Linux kernel 2.4.x and
 2.6.x before 2.6.22.7, when running on the x86_64 architecture, does not
 zero extend the eax register after the 32bit entry path to ptrace is used,
 which might allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an
 out-of-bounds access to the system call table using the %RAX register.
