Description:
 PyDNS (aka python-dns) before 2.3.1-5 in Debian GNU/Linux does not use
 random source ports for DNS requests and does not use random transaction
 IDs for DNS retries, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof
 DNS responses, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-1447.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4099.
