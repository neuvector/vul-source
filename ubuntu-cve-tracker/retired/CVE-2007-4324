Description:
 ActionScript 3 (AS3) in Adobe Flash Player 9.0.47.0, and other versions and
 other 9.0.124.0 and earlier versions, allows remote attackers to bypass the
 Security Sandbox Model, obtain sensitive information, and port scan
 arbitrary hosts via a Flash (SWF) movie that specifies a connection to
 make, then uses timing discrepancies from the SecurityErrorEvent error to
 determine whether a port is open or not.  NOTE: 9.0.115.0 introduces
 support for a workaround, but does not fix the vulnerability.
