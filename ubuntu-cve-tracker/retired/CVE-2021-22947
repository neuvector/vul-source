Description:
 When curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to
 retrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can
 respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curl
 would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses
 but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* the
 TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a
 Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then
 pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into
 sending data back to the user thinking the attacker's injected data comes
 from the TLS-protected server.
