Description:
 Argument injection vulnerability in certain PHP 4.x and 5.x applications,
 when used with sendmail and when accepting remote input for the
 additional_parameters argument to the mb_send_mail function, allows
 context-dependent attackers to read and create arbitrary files by providing
 extra -C and -X arguments to sendmail.  NOTE: it could be argued that this
 is a class of technology-specific vulnerability, instead of a particular
 instance; if so, then this should not be included in CVE.
