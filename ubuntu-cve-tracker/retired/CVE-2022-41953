Description:
 Git GUI is a convenient graphical tool that comes with Git for Windows. Its
 target audience is users who are uncomfortable with using Git on the
 command-line. Git GUI has a function to clone repositories. Immediately
 after the local clone is available, Git GUI will automatically post-process
 it, among other things running a spell checker called `aspell.exe` if it
 was found. Git GUI is implemented as a Tcl/Tk script. Due to the
 unfortunate design of Tcl on Windows, the search path when looking for an
 executable _always includes the current directory_. Therefore, malicious
 repositories can ship with an `aspell.exe` in their top-level directory
 which is executed by Git GUI without giving the user a chance to inspect it
 first, i.e. running untrusted code. This issue has been addressed in
 version 2.39.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
 should avoid using Git GUI for cloning. If that is not a viable option, at
 least avoid cloning from untrusted sources.
