Description:
 The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x
 before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not have the
 expected countermeasures against replay attacks, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the
 network for valid requests, related to lack of checking of nonce (aka
 server nonce) and nc (aka nonce-count or client nonce count) values.
