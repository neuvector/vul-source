Description:
 The KAME IKE Daemon Racoon, when authenticating a peer during Phase 1,
 validates the X.509 certificate but does not verify the RSA signature
 authentication, which allows remote attackers to establish unauthorized IP
 connections or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks using a valid, trusted
 X.509 certificate.
