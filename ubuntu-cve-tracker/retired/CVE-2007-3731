Description:
 The Linux kernel 2.6.20 and 2.6.21 does not properly handle an invalid LDT
 segment selector in %cs (the xcs field) during ptrace single-step
 operations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL
 dereference and OOPS) via certain code that makes ptrace PTRACE_SETREGS and
 PTRACE_SINGLESTEP requests, related to the TRACE_IRQS_ON function, and
 possibly related to the arch_ptrace function.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Evan Teran discovered that the Linux kernel ptrace routines did not correctly
 handle certain requests robustly. Local attackers could exploit this to crash
 the system, causing a denial of service
