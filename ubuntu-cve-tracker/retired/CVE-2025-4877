Description:
 There's a vulnerability in the libssh package where when a libssh consumer
 passes in an unexpectedly large input buffer to ssh_get_fingerprint_hash()
 function. In such cases the bin_to_base64() function can experience an
 integer overflow leading to a memory under allocation, when that happens
 it's possible that the program perform out of bounds write leading to a
 heap corruption.
 This issue affects only 32-bits builds of libssh.
