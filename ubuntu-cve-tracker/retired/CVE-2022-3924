Description:
 This issue can affect BIND 9 resolvers with `stale-answer-enable yes;` that
 also make use of the option `stale-answer-client-timeout`, configured with
 a value greater than zero. If the resolver receives many queries that
 require recursion, there will be a corresponding increase in the number of
 clients that are waiting for recursion to complete. If there are sufficient
 clients already waiting when a new client query is received so that it is
 necessary to SERVFAIL the longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM
 `recursive-clients` limit and soft quota), then it is possible for a race
 to occur between providing a stale answer to this older client and sending
 an early timeout SERVFAIL, which may cause an assertion failure. This issue
 affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10,
 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.
