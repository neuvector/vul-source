Description:
 In Python 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.8, 3.8 through 3.8.4rc1, and
 3.9 through 3.9.0b4 on Windows, a Trojan horse python3.dll might be used in
 cases where CPython is embedded in a native application. This occurs
 because python3X.dll may use an invalid search path for python3.dll loading
 (after Py_SetPath has been used). NOTE: this issue CANNOT occur when using
 python.exe from a standard (non-embedded) Python installation on Windows.
