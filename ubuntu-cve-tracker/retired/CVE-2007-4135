References: 
 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4135
Description:
 The NFSv4 ID mapper (nfsidmap) before 0.17 does not properly handle return
 values from the getpwnam_r function when performing a username lookup,
 which can cause it to report a file as being owned by "root" instead of
 "nobody" if the file exists on the server but not on the client.
