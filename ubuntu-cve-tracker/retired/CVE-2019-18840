Description:
 In wolfSSL 4.1.0 through 4.2.0c, there are missing sanity checks of memory
 accesses in parsing ASN.1 certificate data while handshaking. Specifically,
 there is a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow inside the DecodedCert
 structure in GetName in wolfcrypt/src/asn.c because the domain name
 location index is mishandled. Because a pointer is overwritten, there is an
 invalid free.
