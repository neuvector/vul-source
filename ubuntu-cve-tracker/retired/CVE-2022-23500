Description:
 TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In
 versions prior to 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1, requesting invalid
 or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler, which
 again could retrieve content to be shown as an error message from another
 page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself
 recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits
 of the web server are exceeded. This vulnerability is very similar, but not
 identical, to the one described in CVE-2021-21359. This issue is patched in
 versions 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20 or 12.1.1.
