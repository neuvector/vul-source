Description:
  GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. When
 resolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working directory,
 and after that the PATH environment. GitPython defaults to use the `git`
 command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo has a `git.exe` or `git`
 executable, that program will be run instead of the one in the user's
 `PATH`. This is more of a problem on how Python interacts with Windows
 systems, Linux and any other OS aren't affected by this. But probably
 people using GitPython usually run it from the CWD of a repo. An attacker
 can trick a user to download a repository with a malicious `git`
 executable, if the user runs/imports GitPython from that directory, it
 allows the attacker to run any arbitrary commands. There is no fix
 currently available for windows users, however there are a few mitigations.
 1: Default to an absolute path for the git program on Windows, like
 `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.EXE` (default git path installation). 2:
 Require users to set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variable
 on Windows systems. 3: Make this problem prominent in the documentation and
 advise users to never run GitPython from an untrusted repo, or set the
 `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` env var to an absolute path. 4: Resolve the
 executable manually by only looking into the `PATH` environment variable.
