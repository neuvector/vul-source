Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A Memory Leak vulnerability exists in SQLite Project SQLite3
 3.35.1 and 3.37.0 via maliciously crafted SQL Queries (made via editing the
 Database File), it is possible to query a record, and leak subsequent bytes
 of memory that extend beyond the record, which could let a malicious user
 obtain sensitive information. NOTE: The developer disputes this as a
 vulnerability stating that If you give SQLite a corrupted database file and
 submit a query against the database, it might read parts of the database
 that you did not intend or expect.
