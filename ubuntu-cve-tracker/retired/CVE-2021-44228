Description:
 Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2,
 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and
 parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI
 related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message
 parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message
 lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been
 disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and
 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this
 vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net,
 log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.
