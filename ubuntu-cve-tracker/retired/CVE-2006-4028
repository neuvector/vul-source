Description:
 Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in WordPress before 2.0.4 have unknown
 impact and remote attack vectors.  NOTE: due to lack of details, it is not
 clear how these issues are different from CVE-2006-3389 and CVE-2006-3390,
 although it is likely that 2.0.4 addresses an unspecified issue related to
 "Anyone can register" functionality (user registration for guests).
