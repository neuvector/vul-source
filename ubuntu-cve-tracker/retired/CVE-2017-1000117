Description:
 A malicious third-party can give a crafted "ssh://..." URL to an
 unsuspecting victim, and an attempt to visit the URL can result in any
 program that exists on the victim's machine being executed. Such a URL
 could be placed in the .gitmodules file of a malicious project, and an
 unsuspecting victim could be tricked into running "git clone
 --recurse-submodules" to trigger the vulnerability.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Brian Neel, Joern Schneeweisz, and Jeff King discovered that Git did
 not properly handle host names in 'ssh://' URLs. A remote attacker
 could use this to construct a git repository that when accessed
 could run arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.
