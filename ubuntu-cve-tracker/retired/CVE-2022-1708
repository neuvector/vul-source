Description:
 A vulnerability was found in CRI-O that causes memory or disk space
 exhaustion on the node for anyone with access to the Kube API. The ExecSync
 request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command.
 This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read
 in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the
 command is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is
 possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O
 reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability
 is system availability.
