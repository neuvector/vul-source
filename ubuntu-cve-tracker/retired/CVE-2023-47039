Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl
 for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the
 shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl
 interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the
 operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially
 looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an
 attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak
 permissions, such as `C:\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can be
 executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these
 compromised locations.
