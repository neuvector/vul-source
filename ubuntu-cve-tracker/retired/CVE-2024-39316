Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Starting in version 3.1.0 and
 prior to version 3.1.5, Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
 vulnerability exists in the `Rack::Request::Helpers` module when parsing
 HTTP Accept headers. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker
 sending specially crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers,
 causing the server to spend excessive time processing the request and
 leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The fix for CVE-2024-26146 was not
 applied to the main branch and thus while the issue was fixed for the Rack
 v3.0 release series, it was not fixed in the v3.1 release series until
 v3.1.5. Users of versions on the 3.1 branch should upgrade to version 3.1.5
 to receive the fix.
