Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> qt4-x11 unmaintained upstream (see README.webkit for details)
 jdstrand> webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from
  it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit
 mdeslaur> although I don't know what the upstream patch is, RH stated
 mdeslaur> that it didn't affect their kde4libs versions, so I'm removing
 mdeslaur> it.
 mdeslaur> can't find info on webkit
