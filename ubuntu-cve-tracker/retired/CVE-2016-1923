Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the opj_j2k_update_image_data function in
 OpenJpeg 2016.1.18 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted JPEG 2000 image.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> in issue 704, which references this CVE, there is mention of
 ccdm94> commit d26481f24bd (mayeut/openjpeg), which seems to be aimed at
 ccdm94> fixing this issue. This commit, however, was not included by upstream. 
 ccdm94> The code has changed to something that is similar to what is proposed
 ccdm94> in the previously mentioned non-merged commit, and the commit that
 ccdm94> did this was ad593c9e062. This seems to be the same fix as the one
 ccdm94> for CVE-2016-3182. Considering that this is the fix for the issue,
 ccdm94> even if package openjpeg (versions 1.x) is affected (PoC does not
 ccdm94> reproduce), the only likely upstream patch does not apply as the 
 ccdm94> function being patched does not exist in versions 1.x. No other
 ccdm94> possible patch has been explicitly provided by upstream.
