Description:
 In Sudo before 1.8.26, if pwfeedback is enabled in /etc/sudoers, users can
 trigger a stack-based buffer overflow in the privileged sudo process.
 (pwfeedback is a default setting in Linux Mint and elementary OS; however,
 it is NOT the default for upstream and many other packages, and would exist
 only if enabled by an administrator.) The attacker needs to deliver a long
 string to the stdin of getln() in tgetpass.c.

 mdeslaur> affects 1.7.1 to 1.8.25p1 as it can't be exploited in 1.8.26 to
