Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.1, and Thunderbird
 before 38.1 do not enforce key pinning upon encountering an X.509
 certificate problem that generates a user dialog, which allows
 user-assisted man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions by triggering a (1) expired certificate or (2) mismatched
 hostname for a domain with pinning enabled.
