Description:
 XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the processed
 stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the
 formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on
 these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input
 stream and replace or inject objects, that result in a server-side forgery
 request. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup
 XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal
 required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security
 Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.
