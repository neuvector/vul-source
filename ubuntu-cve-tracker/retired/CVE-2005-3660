Description:
 Linux kernel 2.4 and 2.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory exhaustion and panic) by creating a large number of connected file
 descriptors or socketpairs and setting a large data transfer buffer, then
 preventing Linux from being able to finish the transfer by causing the
 process to become a zombie, or closing the file descriptor without closing
 an associated reference.
