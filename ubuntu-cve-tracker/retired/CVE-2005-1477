Description:
 The install function in Firefox 1.0.3 allows remote web sites on the
 browser's whitelist, such as update.mozilla.org or addon.mozilla.org, to
 execute arbitrary Javascript with chrome privileges, leading to arbitrary
 code execution on the system when combined with vulnerabilities such as
 CVE-2005-1476, as demonstrated using a javascript: URL as the package icon
 and a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on a vulnerable whitelist site.
