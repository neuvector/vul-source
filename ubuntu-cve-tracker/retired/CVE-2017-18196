Description:
 Leptonica 1.74.4 constructs unintended pathnames (containing duplicated
 path components) when operating on files in /tmp subdirectories, which
 might allow local users to bypass intended file restrictions by leveraging
 access to a directory located deeper within the /tmp directory tree, as
 demonstrated by /tmp/ANY/PATH/ANY/PATH/input.tif.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Leptonica incorrectly handled path names. An attacker
 could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.
