Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In
 affected versions an integer overflow bug in Redis can be exploited to
 corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The
 vulnerability involves changing the default proto-max-bulk-len and
 client-query-buffer-limit configuration parameters to very large values and
 constructing specially crafted very large stream elements. The problem is
 fixed in Redis 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to upgrade an
 additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
 redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the
 proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to
 restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.
