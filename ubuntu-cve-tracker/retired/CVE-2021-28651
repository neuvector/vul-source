Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to a
 buffer-management bug, it allows a denial of service. When resolving a
 request with the urn: scheme, the parser leaks a small amount of memory.
 However, there is an unspecified attack methodology that can easily trigger
 a large amount of memory consumption.
