Description:
 The set_language_path function in geshi.php in Generic Syntax Highlighter
 (GeSHi) before 1.0.8.1 might allow remote attackers to conduct file
 inclusion attacks via crafted inputs that influence the default language
 path ($path variable).  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a vendor,
 stating that only a static value is used, so this is not a vulnerability in
 GeSHi. Separate CVE identifiers would be created for web applications that
 integrate GeSHi in a way that allows control of the default language path
