Description:
 wiretap/nettrace_3gpp_32_423.c in the 3GPP TS 32.423 Trace file parser in
 Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not ensure that a '\0' character is
 present at the end of certain strings, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application
 crash) via a crafted file.
