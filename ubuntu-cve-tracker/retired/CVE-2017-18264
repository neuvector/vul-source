Description:
 An issue was discovered in libraries/common.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0
 before 4.0.10.20, 4.4.x, 4.6.x, and 4.7.0 prereleases. The restrictions
 caused by $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false are bypassed under
 certain PHP versions (e.g., version 5). This can allow the login of users
 who have no password set even if the administrator has set
 $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] to false (which is also the
 default). This occurs because some implementations of the PHP substr
 function return false when given '' as the first argument.
