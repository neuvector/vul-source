Description:
 libldap in certain third-party OpenLDAP packages has a
 certificate-validation flaw when the third-party package is asserting
 RFC6125 support. It considers CN even when there is a non-matching
 subjectAltName (SAN). This is fixed in, for example, openldap-2.4.46-10.el8
 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Ubuntu-Description:

 mdeslaur> See RH bug for possible regression fixes
 mdeslaur> per upstream bug, this is an issue with a RH patch to openldap
 mdeslaur> and doesn't apply to upstream openldap.
 mdeslaur> Marking as not-affected since Ubuntu does not carry the patch.
