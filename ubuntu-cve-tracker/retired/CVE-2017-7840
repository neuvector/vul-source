Description:
 JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing
 JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the
 resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript
 will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and
 self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add
 malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.
 This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57.
