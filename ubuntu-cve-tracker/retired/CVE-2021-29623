Description:
 Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete
 and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A read of uninitialized
 memory was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a
 command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and
 modifying the metadata of image files. The read of uninitialized memory is
 triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file.
 An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to leak a few bytes
 of stack memory, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a
 crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.
