Description:
 This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set "super cookies" in curl
 that
 are then passed back to more origins than what is otherwise allowed or
 possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to
 different and unrelated sites and domains.
 
 It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that
 verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For
 example a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower
 case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain.
