Description:
 The QuickEdit module does not properly validate access to routes, which
 could allow cross-site request forgery under some circumstances and lead to
 possible data integrity issues. Sites are only affected if the QuickEdit
 module (which comes with the Standard profile) is installed. Removing the
 "access in-place editing" permission from untrusted users will not fully
 mitigate the vulnerability.
