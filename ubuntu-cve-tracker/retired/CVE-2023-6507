Description:
 An issue was found in CPython 3.12.0 `subprocess` module on POSIX
 platforms. The issue was fixed in CPython 3.12.1 and does not affect other
 stable releases. When using the `extra_groups=` parameter with an empty
 list as a value (ie `extra_groups=[]`) the logic regressed to not call
 `setgroups(0, NULL)` before calling `exec()`, thus not dropping the
 original processes' groups before starting the new process. There is no
 issue when the parameter isn't used or when any value is used besides an
 empty list. This issue only impacts CPython processes run with sufficient
 privilege to make the `setgroups` system call (typically `root`).
