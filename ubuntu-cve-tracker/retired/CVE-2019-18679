Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x through 4.8. Due to
 incorrect data management, it is vulnerable to information disclosure when
 processing HTTP Digest Authentication. Nonce tokens contain the raw byte
 value of a pointer that sits within heap memory allocation. This
 information reduces ASLR protections and may aid attackers isolating memory
 areas to target for remote code execution attacks.
