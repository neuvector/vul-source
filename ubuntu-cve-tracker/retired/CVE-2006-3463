Description:
 The EstimateStripByteCounts function in TIFF library (libtiff) before 3.8.2
 uses a 16-bit unsigned short when iterating over an unsigned 32-bit value,
 which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service via a
 large td_nstrips value, which triggers an infinite loop.
