Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in GNU Grep before 2.11 might allow
 context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving
 a long input line that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> Upstream recommends upgrading to 2.11, but include fixes for two bugs
  introduced in 2.11, and reverting the -r change. See
  oss-security/2012/12/22/3 for details. Upgrading to latest release may also
  make sense.
 jdstrand> Reproducer for amd64 system (tested with 8G of RAM):
  perl -e 'print "x"x(2**31)' | grep x > /dev/null
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 8.04 LTS - 12.04 LTS confirmed to be affected. Each release
  segfaults.
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 12.10+ does not segfault
 jdstrand> RedHat bug has a reduced proposed patch that simply performs
  boundary checking but it has not been commented on as of 2013/05/07
 jdstrand> This is arguably of low priority unless code-execution can be
  demonstrated
