Description:
 In Git before 2.13.7, 2.14.x before 2.14.4, 2.15.x before 2.15.2, 2.16.x
 before 2.16.4, and 2.17.x before 2.17.1, remote code execution can occur.
 With a crafted .gitmodules file, a malicious project can execute an
 arbitrary script on a machine that runs "git clone --recurse-submodules"
 because submodule "names" are obtained from this file, and then appended to
 $GIT_DIR/modules, leading to directory traversal with "../" in a name.
 Finally, post-checkout hooks from a submodule are executed, bypassing the
 intended design in which hooks are not obtained from a remote server.
