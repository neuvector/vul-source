Description:
 A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS in
 versions before 3.55. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause
 out-of-bounds reads. This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling
 multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly
 enforcing tag length. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
 confidentiality and system availability.
