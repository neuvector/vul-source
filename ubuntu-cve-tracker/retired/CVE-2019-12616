Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin before 4.9.0. A vulnerability was
 found that allows an attacker to trigger a CSRF attack against a phpMyAdmin
 user. The attacker can trick the user, for instance through a broken <img>
 tag pointing at the victim's phpMyAdmin database, and the attacker can
 potentially deliver a payload (such as a specific INSERT or DELETE
 statement) to the victim.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that phpMyAdmin incorrectly handled some requests. An
 attacker could possibly use this to perform a CSRF attack.
