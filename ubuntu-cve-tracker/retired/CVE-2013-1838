Description:
 OpenStack Compute (Nova) Grizzly, Folsom (2012.2), and Essex (2012.1) does
 not properly implement a quota for fixed IPs, which allows remote
 authenticated users to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion and
 failure to spawn new instances) via a large number of calls to the
 addFixedIp function.
