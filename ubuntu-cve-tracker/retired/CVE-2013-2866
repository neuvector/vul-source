Description:
 The Flash plug-in in Google Chrome before 27.0.1453.116, as used on Google
 Chrome OS before 27.0.1453.116 and separately, does not properly determine
 whether a user wishes to permit camera or microphone access by a Flash
 application, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
 from a machine's physical environment via a clickjacking attack, as
 demonstrated by an attack using a crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
 opacity property.
