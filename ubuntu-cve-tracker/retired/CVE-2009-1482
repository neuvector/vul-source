Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in action/AttachFile.py
 in MoinMoin 1.8.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
 web script or HTML via (1) an AttachFile sub-action in the error_msg
 function or (2) multiple vectors related to package file errors in the
 upload_form function, different vectors than CVE-2009-0260.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> debian says etch is not affected, as the XSS vulns are already
 mdeslaur> fixed.
