Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Info-ZIP Zip 3.0, when the -T and -TT command-line options
 are used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of an
 off-by-one error. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are realistic scenarios
 in which an untrusted party controls the -TT value, given that the entire
 purpose of -TT is execution of arbitrary commands.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> suse does not have plans to fix it and debian marked as
  negligible.
 rodrigo-zaiden> There is no obvious security impact since there is no
  scenarios where an untrusted party controls the -TT input value.
 rodrigo-zaiden> Ubuntu is ignoring it as it is being disputed and there is
  no update as of 2022-02-01.
