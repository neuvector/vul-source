Description:
 Off-by-one buffer overflow in the Instance_options::complete_initialization
 function in instance_options.cc in the Instance Manager in MySQL before
 5.0.23 and 5.1 before 5.1.12 might allow local users to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) via unspecified vectors, which triggers the
 overflow when the convert_dirname function is called.  NOTE: the vendor has
 disputed this issue via e-mail to CVE, saying that it is only exploitable
 when the user has access to the configuration file or the Instance Manager
 daemon.  Due to intended functionality, this level of access would already
 allow the user to disrupt program operation, so this does not cross
 security boundaries and is not a vulnerability
