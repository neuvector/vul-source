Description:
 Exim AUTH Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This
 vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
 installations of Exim. Authentication is not required to exploit this
 vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the smtp service, which listens on TCP port
 25 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
 user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of a buffer.
 An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context
 of the service account.
 . Was ZDI-CAN-17434.
