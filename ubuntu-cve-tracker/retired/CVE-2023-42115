Description:
 Exim AUTH Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This
 vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
 installations of Exim. Authentication is not required to exploit this
 vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the smtp service, which
 listens on TCP port 25 by default. The issue results from the lack of
 proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past
 the end of a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute
 code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-17434.
