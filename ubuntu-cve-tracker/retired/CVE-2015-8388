Description:
 PCRE before 8.38 mishandles the /(?=di(?<=(?1))|(?=(.))))/ pattern and
 related patterns with an unmatched closing parenthesis, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated
 by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.

Notes:
 tyhicks> Issue affects PCRE3 only
 tyhicks> Marking 'low' since it requires PCRE to operate on untrusted regular
  expressions which is not very likely

 mdeslaur> was supposed to be fixed in wily (2:8.35-7ubuntu2) but got
 mdeslaur> reverted in (2:8.35-7ubuntu5) by mistake
