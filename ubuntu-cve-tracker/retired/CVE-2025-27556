Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 5.1 before 5.1.8 and 5.0 before 5.0.14.

 django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView, django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView,
 and django.views.i18n.set_language are subject to a potential
 denial-of-service attack via certain inputs with a very large number of
 Unicode characters.
