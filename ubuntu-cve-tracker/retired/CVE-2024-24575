Description:
 libgit2 is a portable C implementation of the Git core methods provided as
 a linkable library with a solid API, allowing to build Git functionality
 into your application. Using well-crafted inputs to `git_revparse_single`
 can cause the function to enter an infinite loop, potentially causing a
 Denial of Service attack in the calling application. The revparse function
 in `src/libgit2/revparse.c` uses a loop to parse the user-provided spec
 string. There is an edge-case during parsing that allows a bad actor to
 force the loop conditions to access arbitrary memory. Potentially, this
 could also leak memory if the extracted rev spec is reflected back to the
 attacker. As such, libgit2 versions before 1.4.0 are not affected. Users
 should upgrade to version 1.6.5 or 1.7.2.
