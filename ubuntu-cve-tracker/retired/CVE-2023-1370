Description:
 [Json-smart](https://netplex.github.io/json-smart/) is a performance
 focused, JSON processor lib. When reaching a ‘[‘ or ‘{‘ character in the
 JSON input, the code parses an array or an object respectively. It was
 discovered that the code does not have any limit to the nesting of such
 arrays or objects. Since the parsing of nested arrays and objects is done
 recursively, nesting too many of them can cause a stack exhaustion (stack
 overflow) and crash the software.
