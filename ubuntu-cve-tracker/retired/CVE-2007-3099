Description:
 usr/mgmt_ipc.c in iscsid in open-iscsi (iscsi-initiator-utils) before
 2.0-865 checks the client's UID on the listening AF_LOCAL socket instead of
 the new connection, which allows remote attackers to access the management
 interface and cause a denial of service (iscsid exit or iSCSI connection
 loss).
