Description:
 The sysctl functionality (sysctl.c) in Linux kernel before 2.6.14.1 allows
 local users to cause a denial of service (kernel oops) and possibly execute
 code by opening an interface file in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/, waiting
 until the interface is unregistered, then obtaining and modifying function
 pointers in memory that was used for the ctl_table.
