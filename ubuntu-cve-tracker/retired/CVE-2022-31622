Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of
 Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs
 (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method
 create_worker_threads, the held lock is not released correctly, which
 allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.
 Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a
 vulnerability with adverse effects.
