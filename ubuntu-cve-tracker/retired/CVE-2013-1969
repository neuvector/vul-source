Description:
 Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in libxml2 2.9.0 and possibly other
 versions might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to
 the (1) htmlParseChunk and (2) xmldecl_done functions, as demonstrated by a
 buffer overflow in the xmlBufGetInputBase function.
