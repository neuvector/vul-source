Description:
 In Symfony before versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5, the CachingHttpClient class
 from the HttpClient Symfony component relies on the HttpCache class to
 handle requests. HttpCache uses internal headers like X-Body-Eval and
 X-Body-File to control the restoration of cached responses. The class was
 initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTP
 calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by
 CachingHttpClient and if an attacker can control the response for a request
 being made by the CachingHttpClient, remote code execution is possible.
 This has been fixed in versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5.
