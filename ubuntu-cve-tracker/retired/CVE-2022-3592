Description:
 A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can
 create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share
 path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of
 the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create
 symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access
 to another restricted server's filesystem.
