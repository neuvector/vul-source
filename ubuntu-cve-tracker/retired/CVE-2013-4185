Description:
 Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before
 2013.1.3 and Havana before havana-3 does not properly handle network source
 security group policy updates, which allows remote authenticated users to
 cause a denial of service (nova-network consumption) via a large number of
 server-creation operations, which triggers a large number of update
 requests.
