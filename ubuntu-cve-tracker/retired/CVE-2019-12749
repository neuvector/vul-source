Description:
 dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as
 used in DBusServer in Canonical Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less
 common, uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of symlink
 mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the
 libdbus library. (This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication
 mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directory
 could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a
 different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case,
 this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the
 malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent
 client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication
 bypass.
