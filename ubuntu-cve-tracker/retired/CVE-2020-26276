Description:
 Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.5.1, due
 to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may
 be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result
 in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP. Users that configure Fleet
 with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue. This issue is patched in
 3.5.1. The fix was made using
 https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator If upgrade to 3.5.1
 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet.
