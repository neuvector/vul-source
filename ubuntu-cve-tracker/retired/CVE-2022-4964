Description:
 Ubuntu's pipewire-pulse in snap grants microphone access even when the snap
 interface for audio-record is not set.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> jammy uses pulseaudio by default, but affected if switched
 alexmurray> pipewire in focal does not include pipewire-pulse and so is
  not affected
 hlibk> In order for the packages to be vulnerable in jammy, the user must
  have removed the default pulseaudio installation and switched to using
  pipewire-pulse. Additionally, the fix would require new dependencies as
  well as the addition of a new feature. This might break existing
  functionality.
