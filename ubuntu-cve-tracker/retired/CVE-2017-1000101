Description:
 curl supports "globbing" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical
 range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of
 transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there
 was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if
 given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored
 in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something
 else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would
 be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.
