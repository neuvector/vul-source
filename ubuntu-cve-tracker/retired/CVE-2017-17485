Description:
 FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.10 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows
 unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the
 CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by sending
 maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper,
 bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the Spring libraries are
 available in the classpath.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled
 deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
 arbitrary code.
