Description:
 In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.30, 8.2.* before 8.2.24, 8.3.* before
 8.3.12, HTTP_REDIRECT_STATUS variable is used to check whether or not CGI
 binary is being run by the HTTP server. However, in certain scenarios, the
 content of this variable can be controlled by the request submitter via
 HTTP headers, which can lead to cgi.force_redirect option not being
 correctly applied. In certain configurations this may lead to arbitrary
 file inclusion in PHP.
