Description:
 An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. A remote attacker can
 obtain cleartext content by sending an encrypted data block (that the
 attacker cannot directly decrypt) to a victim, and relying on the victim to
 automatically decrypt that block and then send it back to the attacker as
 quoted text, aka the TBE-01-005 "replay" issue.
