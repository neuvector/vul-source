Description:
 OpenVPN before 2.0.1, when running with "verb 0" and without TLS
 authentication, does not properly flush the OpenSSL error queue when a
 client fails certificate authentication to the server and causes the error
 to be processed by the wrong client, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (client disconnection) via a large number of failed
 authentication attempts.
