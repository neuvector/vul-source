Description:
 When switching to other buffers using the :all command and visual mode
 still being active, this may cause a heap-buffer overflow, because Vim does
 not properly end visual mode and therefore may try to access beyond the end
 of a line in a buffer. In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim will correctly reset the
 visual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore fix this
 bug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if
 the position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is
 medium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the
 :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a
 for reporting this issue. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch
 v9.1.1003

Notes:
 hlibk> On bionic and below, the patched files have changed too much which
 hlibk> makes the backport difficult to apply without potentially
