 Firefox before 1.0.5 allows remote attackers to steal information and
 possibly execute arbitrary code by using standalone applications such as
 Flash and QuickTime to open a javascript: URL, which is run in the context
 of the previous page, and may lead to code execution if the standalone
 application loads a privileged chrome: URL.
