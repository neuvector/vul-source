Description:
 In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute is
 supplied to the function ntfs_get_attribute_value, a heap buffer overflow
 can occur allowing for memory disclosure or denial of service. The
 vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound buffer access which can be
 triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root cause is a missing
 consistency check after reading an MFT record : the "bytes_in_use" field
 should be less than the "bytes_allocated" field. When it is not, the
 parsing of the records proceeds into the wild.
