Description:
 Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
 deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An inefficient
 algorithm (quadratic complexity) was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and
 earlier. The inefficient algorithm is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write
 metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit
 the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the
 victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in
 version v0.27.4. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the
 metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_
 the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line
 application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `rm`.
