Description:
 The V2 API in OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service (Glance) before
 2014.2.2 and 2014.1.4 allows remote authenticated users to read or delete
 arbitrary files via a full pathname in a file: URL in the image location
 property.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Per upstream, "A potential mitigation strategy available for
  operators is to change the glance policy to restrict access to administrators
  for get_image_location, set_image_location, and delete_image_location."
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS not affected (does not have V2 API)
 jdstrand> preliminary packages for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 14.10 can be found in:
