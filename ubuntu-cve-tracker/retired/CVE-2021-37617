Description:
 The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud
 Server with a computer. The Nextcloud Desktop Client invokes its
 uninstaller script when being installed to make sure there are no remnants
 of previous installations. In versions 3.0.3 through 3.2.4, the Client
 searches the `Uninstall.exe` file in a folder that can be written by
 regular users. This could lead to a case where a malicious user creates a
 malicious `Uninstall.exe`, which would be executed with administrative
 privileges on the Nextcloud Desktop Client installation. This issue is
 fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. As a workaround, do not
 allow untrusted users to create content in the `C:\` system folder and
 verify that there is no malicious `C:\Uninstall.exe` file on the system.
