Description:
 An issue was discovered in open-vm-tools 2009.03.18-154848. Local users can
 bypass intended access restrictions on mounting shares via a symlink attack
 that leverages a realpath race condition in mount.vmhgfs (aka hgfsmounter).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> mount.vmhgfs not suid root in Debian and Ubuntu, negligible
 mdeslaur> security impact. Upstream commit removes vmhgfs in favour of
 mdeslaur> hgfs-fuse.
 mdeslaur> Since this has no security impact on Ubuntu, and there is no
 mdeslaur> upstream fix for the issue, we will not be fixing this in
 mdeslaur> stable releases.
