Description:
 A certain Debian patch for OpenSSH before 4.3p2-9etch3 on etch; before
 4.6p1-1 on sid and lenny; and on other distributions such as SUSE uses
 functions that are not async-signal-safe in the signal handler for login
 timeouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (connection slot exhaustion) via multiple login attempts. NOTE: this issue
 exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2006-5051.
