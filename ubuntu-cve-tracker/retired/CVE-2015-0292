Description:
 Integer underflow in the EVP_DecodeUpdate function in crypto/evp/encode.c
 in the base64-decoding implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0
 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via crafted base64 data that triggers a buffer overflow.
