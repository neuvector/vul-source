Description:
 LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allow
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request
 (intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client
 to send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum size
 allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for
 normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size
 is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and
 executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example,
 if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color
 codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running
 graphical session.
