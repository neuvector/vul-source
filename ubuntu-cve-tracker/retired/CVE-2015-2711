Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 does not recognize a referrer policy delivered
 by a referrer META element in cases of context-menu navigation and
 middle-click navigation, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information by reading web-server Referer logs that contain private data in
 a URL, as demonstrated by a private path component.
