Description:
 usr/log.c in iscsid in open-iscsi (iscsi-initiator-utils) before 2.0-865
 uses a semaphore with insecure permissions (world-writable/world-readable)
 for managing log messages using shared memory, which allows local users to
 cause a denial of service (hang) by grabbing the semaphore.
