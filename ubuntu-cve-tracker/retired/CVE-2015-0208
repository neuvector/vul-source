Description:
 The ASN.1 signature-verification implementation in the rsa_item_verify
 function in crypto/rsa/rsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
 application crash) via crafted RSA PSS parameters to an endpoint that uses
 the certificate-verification feature.
