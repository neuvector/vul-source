Description:
 The tm_adopt function in lib/Libifl/tm.c in Terascale Open-Source Resource
 and Queue Manager (aka TORQUE Resource Manager) 5.0.x, 4.5.x, 4.2.x, and
 earlier does not validate that the owner of the process also owns the
 adopted session id, which allows remote authenticated users to kill
 arbitrary processes via a crafted executable.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that TORQUE Resource Manager does not validate that the
 owner of the process also owns the adopted session id. A remote
 authenticated attacker could possibly use this to kill arbitrary processes.
