Description:
 Puppet 2.7.x before 2.7.21 and 3.1.x before 3.1.1, and Puppet Enterprise
 2.7.x before 2.7.2, does not properly negotiate the SSL protocol between
 client and master, which allows remote attackers to conduct SSLv2 downgrade
 attacks against SSLv3 sessions via unspecified vectors.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> Upstream no longer supports 0.25.x as found in lucid. The code
 mdeslaur> is substantially different, rendering a backport of this
 mdeslaur> security update difficult. Since puppet in Lucid is almost
 mdeslaur> end-of-life, we aren't planning on backporting the security fix
 mdeslaur> to it. For Lucid users, we recommend using puppet
 mdeslaur> 2.7.1-1ubuntu3.8~ubuntu10.04.1 currently in lucid-backports.
