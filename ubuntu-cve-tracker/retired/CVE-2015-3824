Description:
 The MPEG4Extractor::parseChunk function in MPEG4Extractor.cpp in
 libstagefright in Android before 5.1.1 LMY48I does not properly restrict
 size addition, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
 cause a denial of service (integer overflow and memory corruption) via a
 crafted MPEG-4 tx3g atom, aka internal bug 20923261.
