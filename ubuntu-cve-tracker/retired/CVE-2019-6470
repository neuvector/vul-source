Description:
 There had existed in one of the ISC BIND libraries a bug in a function that
 was used by dhcpd when operating in DHCPv6 mode. There was also a bug in
 dhcpd relating to the use of this function per its documentation, but the
 bug in the library function prevented this from causing any harm. All
 releases of dhcpd from ISC contain copies of this, and other, BIND
 libraries in combinations that have been tested prior to release and are
 known to not present issues like this. Some third-party packagers of ISC
 software have modified the dhcpd source, BIND source, or version matchup in
 ways that create the crash potential. Based on reports available to ISC,
 the crash probability is large and no analysis has been done on how, or
 even if, the probability can be manipulated by an attacker. Affects: Builds
 of dhcpd versions prior to version 4.4.1 when using BIND versions 9.11.2 or
 later, or BIND versions with specific bug fixes backported to them. ISC
 does not have access to comprehensive version lists for all repackagings of
 dhcpd that are vulnerable. In particular, builds from other vendors may
 also be affected. Operators are advised to consult their vendor
 documentation.
