Description:
 Mozilla Network Security Service (NSS) library before 3.11.3, as used in
 Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.7, Thunderbird before 1.5.0.7, and SeaMonkey
 before 1.0.5, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, does not properly
 handle extra data in a signature, which allows remote attackers to forge
 signatures for SSL/TLS and email certificates, a similar vulnerability to
 CVE-2006-4339. NOTE: on 20061107, Mozilla released an advisory stating that
 these versions were not completely patched by MFSA2006-60. The newer fixes
 for 1.5.0.7 are covered by CVE-2006-5462.
