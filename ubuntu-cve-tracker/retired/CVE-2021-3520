Description:
 There's a flaw in lz4. An attacker who submits a crafted file to an
 application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow,
 leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an
 out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is to
 availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity
 as well.
