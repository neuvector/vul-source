Description:
 The Open Phone Abstraction Library (opal), as used by (1) Ekiga before
 2.0.10 and (2) OpenH323 before 2.2.4, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) via an invalid Content-Length header field in
 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets, which causes a \0 byte to be
 written to an "attacker-controlled address."
