Description:
 LibTIFF master branch has an out-of-bounds read in LZWDecode in
 libtiff/tif_lzw.c:619, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via
 a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix
 is available with commit b4e79bfa.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> according to the issue in the libtiff git (410), this only affects
 ccdm94> version 4.3.0 onwards, more specifically, versions that include
 ccdm94> commit 3079627e. Further investigation has confirmed that versions
 ccdm94> below 4.3.0 seem to be not affected, as the reproducer does not 
 ccdm94> work, and there are no SEGV errors. Impish and jammy, which 
 ccdm94> include version 4.3.0, also do not seem to be affected, as results 
 ccdm94> from running the POCs with their versions are different than the 
 ccdm94> ones obtained when the specific commit mentioned in the 410 issue
 ccdm94> by the issue reporter is used with the same POC files (commit 
 ccdm94> b51bb157). For this reason, and because jammy and earlier do not
 ccdm94> include code from commit 3079627e, these releases will be marked 
 ccdm94> as not vulnerable.
