Description:
 The Off Main Thread Compositing (OMTC) implementation in Mozilla Firefox
 before 37.0 makes an incorrect memset call during interaction with the
 mozilla::layers::BufferTextureClient::AllocateForSurface function, which
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
 service (memory corruption and application crash) via vectors that trigger
 rendering of 2D graphics content.
