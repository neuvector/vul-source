Description:
 A privilege escalation vulnerability was found in nagios 4.2.x that occurs
 in daemon-init.in when creating necessary files and insecurely changing the
 ownership afterwards. It's possible for the local attacker to create
 symbolic links before the files are to be created and possibly escalating
 the privileges with the ownership change.
