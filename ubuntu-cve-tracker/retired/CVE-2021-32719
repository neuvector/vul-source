Description:
 RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging broker. In rabbitmq-server prior to
 version 3.8.18, when a federation link was displayed in the RabbitMQ
 management UI via the `rabbitmq_federation_management` plugin, its consumer
 tag was rendered without proper <script> tag sanitization. This potentially
 allows for JavaScript code execution in the context of the page. The user
 must be signed in and have elevated permissions (manage federation
 upstreams and policies) for this to occur. The vulnerability is patched in
 RabbitMQ 3.8.18. As a workaround, disable the
 `rabbitmq_federation_management` plugin and use [CLI
 tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html) instead.
