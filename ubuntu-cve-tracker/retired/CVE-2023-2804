Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo in
 h2v2_merged_upsample_internal() function of jdmrgext.c file. The
 vulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for which
 the range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range, hence, an
 attacker could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image that contains
 out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting to decompress such
 image using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault or buffer
 overflows, causing an application to crash.

Notes:
 jdstrand> libjpeg-turbo is a fork of libjpeg8
 mdeslaur> the libjpeg package is an unrelated codebase
 mdeslaur> lossless support was added in libjpeg-tubo here:
