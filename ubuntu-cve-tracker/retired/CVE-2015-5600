Description:
 The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through
 6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive
 devices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU
 consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh
 -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that
 provides a different password for each pam element on this list.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Only affects systems with KbdInteractiveAuthentication set to 'yes'.
  By default, that option is set to 'no' in Ubuntu.
