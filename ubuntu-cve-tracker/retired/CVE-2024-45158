Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.6 before 3.6.1. A stack buffer
 overflow in mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw() and mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der() can
 occur when the bits parameter is larger than the largest supported curve.
 In some configurations with PSA disabled, all values of bits are affected.
 (This never happens in internal library calls, but can affect applications
 that call these functions directly.)
