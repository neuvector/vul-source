Description:
 zend_hash_del_key_or_index in zend_hash.c in PHP before 4.4.3 and 5.x
 before 5.1.3 can cause zend_hash_del to delete the wrong element, which
 prevents a variable from being unset even when the PHP unset function is
 called, which might cause the variable's value to be used in
 security-relevant operations.
