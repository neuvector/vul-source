Description:
 An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existed
 where determining if a macro was signed by a trusted author was done by
 only matching the serial number and issuer string of the used certificate
 with that of a trusted certificate. This is not sufficient to verify that
 the macro was actually signed with the certificate. An adversary could
 therefore create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an
 issuer string identical to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would
 present as belonging to the trusted author, potentially leading to the user
 to execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted. This
 issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to
 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.
