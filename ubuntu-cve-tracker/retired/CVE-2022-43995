Description:
 Sudo 1.8.0 through 1.9.12, with the crypt() password backend, contains a
 plugins/sudoers/auth/passwd.c array-out-of-bounds error that can result in
 a heap-based buffer over-read. This can be triggered by arbitrary local
 users with access to Sudo by entering a password of seven characters or
 fewer. The impact could vary depending on the system libraries, compiler,
 and processor architecture.
