Description:
 A flaw was found in avahi in versions 0.6 up to 0.8. The event used to
 signal the termination of the client connection on the avahi Unix socket is
 not correctly handled in the client_work function, allowing a local
 attacker to trigger an infinite loop. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to the availability of the avahi service, which becomes
 unresponsive after this flaw is triggered.
