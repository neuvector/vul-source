Description:
 The X.Org X wrapper (xserver-wrapper.c) in Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu
 Linux does not properly verify the TTY of a user who is starting X, which
 allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions by associating
 stdin with a file that is misinterpreted as the console TTY.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> requires pty access. In combination with CVE-2011-4029 this becomes
  more important, but that CVE is fixed in Ubuntu.
 mdeslaur> Debian fixed this by dropping support for alternate TTY devices,
 mdeslaur> which we need for upstart support. See changelog for
 mdeslaur> (1:7.4~2ubuntu2) and (1:7.4~4).
