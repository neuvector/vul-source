Description:
 The encode_name macro in misc/mntent_r.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or
 libc6) 2.11.1 and earlier, as used by ncpmount and mount.cifs, does not
 properly handle newline characters in mountpoint names, which allows local
 users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption), or possibly modify
 mount options and gain privileges, via a crafted mount request.
