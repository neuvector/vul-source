Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Variable names present
 are expanded in the supplied command line into their corresponding variable
 contents, using a 1kB stack buffer for temporary storage, without
 sufficient bounds checking. If the function is called with a command line
 that references a variable with a sufficiently large payload, it is
 possible to overflow the stack buffer, corrupt the stack frame and control
 execution which could also circumvent Secure Boot protections. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as
 well as system availability.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Chris Coulson discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the
 command line parser in GRUB 2. A local attacker could use this to
 execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes:
 sbeattie| grub2-unsigned will contain fixes and supersede grub2, which
  will contain only BIOS grub bits.
