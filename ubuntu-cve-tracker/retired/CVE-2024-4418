Description:
 A race condition leading to a stack use-after-free flaw was found in
 libvirt. Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method,
 the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure
 ended up being used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data
 pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from
 virNetClientIOEventLoop(). The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger
 requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this
 issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access.
 This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without
 authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could
 access it.
