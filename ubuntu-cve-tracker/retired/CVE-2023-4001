Description:
 An authentication bypass flaw was found in GRUB due to the way that GRUB
 uses the UUID of a device to search for the configuration file that
 contains the password hash for the GRUB password protection feature. An
 attacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a USB stick
 containing a file system with a duplicate UUID (the same as in the "/boot/"
 file system) can bypass the GRUB password protection feature on UEFI
 systems, which enumerate removable drives before non-removable ones. This
 issue was introduced in a downstream patch in Red Hat's version of grub2
 and does not affect the upstream package.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> CVE-2023-4001 has no impact Ubuntu or Secure Boot, ignoring.
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes
 eslerm> the grub2 package unlikely affects Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2 and grub2-unsigned should have same major version
 eslerm> Ubuntu Secure Boot and ESM do not cover i386
 eslerm> trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new versions of grub
 eslerm> Note that key revocation is required to protect against evil
 eslerm> housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
