Description:
 An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 in the FTP
 connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used
 during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a
 connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain
 FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
 CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the
 configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could
 lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer,
 potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
