Description:
 Sensitive data could be exposed in world readable logs of cloud-init before
 version 22.3 when schema failures are reported. This leak could include
 hashed passwords.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Mike Stroyan discovered that cloud-init could log password hashes
 when reporting schema failures. An attacker with access to these
 logs could potentially use this to gain user credentials.
Notes:
 sbeattie> introduced in 22.2, therefore xenial and trusty are not
   affected
Mitigation:
 The Ubuntu update to address this attempted to redact information
 contained in /var/log/cloud-init.log. Additional logs may require the
 removal of sensitive information; such information would be preceded
 by the following text:
