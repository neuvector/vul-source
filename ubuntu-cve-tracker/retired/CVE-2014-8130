Description:
 The _TIFFmalloc function in tif_unix.c in LibTIFF 4.0.3 does not reject a
 zero size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted TIFF image that
 is mishandled by the TIFFWriteScanline function in tif_write.c, as
 demonstrated by tiffdither.
