Description:
 An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability
 exists in curl <v7.88.0 based on the "chained" HTTP compression algorithms,
 meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and
 potentially with differentalgorithms. The number of acceptable "links" in
 this "decompression chain" wascapped, but the cap was implemented on a
 per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a virtually unlimited
 number of compression steps simply byusing many headers. The use of such a
 decompression chain could result in a "malloc bomb", making curl end up
 spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and
 returning out of memory errors.
