Description:
 An integer underflow in dpdk versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5 in
 the `move_desc` function can lead to large amounts of CPU cycles being
 eaten up in a long running loop. An attacker could cause `move_desc` to get
 stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending on how
 `vhost_crypto` is being used this could prevent other VMs or network tasks
 from being serviced by the busy DPDK lcore for an extended period.
