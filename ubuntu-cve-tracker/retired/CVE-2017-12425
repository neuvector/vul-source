Description:
 An issue was discovered in Varnish HTTP Cache 4.0.1 through 4.0.4, 4.1.0
 through 4.1.7, 5.0.0, and 5.1.0 through 5.1.2. A wrong if statement in the
 varnishd source code means that particular invalid requests from the client
 can trigger an assert, related to an Integer Overflow. This causes the
 varnishd worker process to abort and restart, losing the cached contents in
 the process. An attacker can therefore crash the varnishd worker process on
 demand and effectively keep it from serving content - a Denial-of-Service
 attack. The specific source-code filename containing the incorrect
 statement varies across releases.
