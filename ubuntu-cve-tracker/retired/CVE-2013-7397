 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-7397
Description:
 Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips X.509
 certificate verification unless both a keyStore location and a trustStore
 location are explicitly set, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
 spoof HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary certificate during use of a
 typical AHC configuration, as demonstrated by a configuration that does not
 send client certificates.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that AsyncHttpClient did not properly validate SSL/TLS
 certificates. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute a
 man-in-the-middle attack.
