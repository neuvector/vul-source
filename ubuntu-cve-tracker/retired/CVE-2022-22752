Description:
 Mozilla developers Christian Holler and Jason Kratzer reported memory
 safety bugs present in Firefox 95. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
 memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these
 could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
 Firefox < 96.
