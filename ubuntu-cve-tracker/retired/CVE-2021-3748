Description:
 A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU.
 It could occur when the descriptor's address belongs to the non direct
 access region, due to num_buffers being set after the virtqueue elem has
 been unmapped. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash QEMU,
 resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute code on
 the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
