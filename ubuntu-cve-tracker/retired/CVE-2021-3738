Description:
 In DCE/RPC it is possible to share the handles (cookies for resource state)
 between multiple connections via a mechanism called 'association groups'.
 These handles can reference connections to our sam.ldb database. However
 while the database was correctly shared, the user credentials state was
 only pointed at, and when one connection within that association group
 ended, the database would be left pointing at an invalid 'struct
 session_info'. The most likely outcome here is a crash, but it is possible
 that the use-after-free could instead allow different user state to be
 pointed at and this might allow more privileged access.

Notes: 
 mdeslaur> Fixing this in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS would require substantial
 mdeslaur> code backports. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu 18.04
 mdeslaur> LTS. In environments where this is of concern, we recommend
 mdeslaur> updating to a more recent Ubuntu version.
