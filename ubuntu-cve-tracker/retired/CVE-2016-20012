Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** OpenSSH through 8.7 allows remote attackers, who have a
 suspicion that a certain combination of username and public key is known to
 an SSH server, to test whether this suspicion is correct. This occurs
 because a challenge is sent only when that combination could be valid for a
 login session. NOTE: the vendor does not recognize user enumeration as a
 vulnerability for this product.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
 seth-arnold> The upstream OpenSSH developers see this as an important
  security feature and do not intend to 'fix' it.
 ccdm94> Reading through the comments in PR 270, which is now closed and has
 ccdm94> not been merged, it is possible to see that upstream does not plan
 ccdm94> on fixing this issue because it would introduce too many possible
 ccdm94> new problems.
