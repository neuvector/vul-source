Description:
 The ImageInputType::ensurePrimaryContent function in
 WebKit/Source/core/html/forms/ImageInputType.cpp in Blink, as used in
 Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.87, does not properly maintain the user
 agent shadow DOM, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that leverage
 "type confusion."
