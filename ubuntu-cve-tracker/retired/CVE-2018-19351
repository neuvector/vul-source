Description:
 Jupyter Notebook before 5.7.1 allows XSS via an untrusted notebook because
 nbconvert responses are considered to have the same origin as the notebook
 server. In other words, nbconvert endpoints can execute JavaScript with
 access to the server API. In notebook/nbconvert/handlers.py,
 NbconvertFileHandler and NbconvertPostHandler do not set a Content Security
 Policy to prevent this.
