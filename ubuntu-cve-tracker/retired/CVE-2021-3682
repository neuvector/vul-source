Description:
 A flaw was found in the USB redirector device emulation of QEMU in versions
 prior to 6.1.0-rc2. It occurs when dropping packets during a bulk transfer
 from a SPICE client due to the packet queue being full. A malicious SPICE
 client could use this flaw to make QEMU call free() with faked heap chunk
 metadata, resulting in a crash of QEMU or potential code execution with the
 privileges of the QEMU process on the host.
