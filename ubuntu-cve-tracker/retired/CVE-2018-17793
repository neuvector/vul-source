Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 msalvatore> Upstream has asked MITRE to reject this as not a security
             vulnerability. Upstream says, "Python in the virtualenv "sandbox" is
             0% secure; it's neither designed to nor does it provide any
             protection against malicious code. You seem very confused about the
             purpose of virtualenv."
