Description:
 Red Hat libvirt, possibly 0.7.2 through 0.8.2, recurses into disk-image
 backing stores without extracting the defined disk backing-store format,
 which might allow guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS,
 and possibly have unspecified other impact, via unknown vectors.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes: 
 jdstrand> AppArmor in Ubuntu 10.04 should mostly protect the host OS, but
  an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another
  machine.
 jdstrand> upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected
  releases, requires a conffile change and a migration helper.
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is the first release to probe the backing stores
 jdstrand> the changes for CVE-2010-2238 introduced LP: #665531. Upstream has
  stated that "<driver name='qemu' type='host_device'/>" was only accidentally
  supported and that they do not intend to fix it. Since this used to work on
  10.04 LTS and a number of people were affected, a fix will be issued for
  10.04 LTS only. Libvirt 0.8.3 (in Ubuntu 10.10) will not support specifying
  type='host_device'. The discussion can be seen on the libvirt mailing.
