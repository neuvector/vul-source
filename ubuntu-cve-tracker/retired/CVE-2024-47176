Description:
 CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `cups-browsed`
 contains network printing functionality including, but not limited to,
 auto-discovering print services and shared printers. `cups-browsed` binds
 to `INADDR_ANY:631`, causing it to trust any packet from any source, and
 can cause the `Get-Printer-Attributes` IPP request to an attacker
 controlled URL. When combined with other vulnerabilities, such as
 CVE-2024-47076, CVE-2024-47175, and CVE-2024-47177, an attacker can execute
 arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine without authentication
 when a malicious printer is printed to.
