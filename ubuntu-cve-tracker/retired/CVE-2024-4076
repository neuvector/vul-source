Description:
 Client queries that trigger serving stale data and that also require
 lookups in local authoritative zone data may result in an assertion
 failure.
 This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.13 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through
 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through 9.19.24, 9.11.33-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.13-S1
 through 9.16.50-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> in focal and jammy, isc-dhcp uses the bind9-libs package
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
 mdeslaur> This only affected 9.16.13 and higher.
