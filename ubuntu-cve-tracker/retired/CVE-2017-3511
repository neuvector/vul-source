Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle
 Java SE (subcomponent: JCE). Supported versions that are affected are Java
 SE: 7u131 and 8u121; Java SE Embedded: 8u121; JRockit: R28.3.13. Difficult
 to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the
 infrastructure where Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit executes to
 compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks require
 human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the
 vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit, attacks may
 significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit.
 Note: Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability
 can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and
 sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs
 in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start
 applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS
 3.0 Base Score 7.7 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).
 CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
