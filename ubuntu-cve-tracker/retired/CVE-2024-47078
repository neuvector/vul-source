Description:
 Meshtastic is an open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network.
 Meshtastic uses MQTT to communicate over an internet connection to a shared
 or private MQTT Server. Nodes can communicate directly via an internet
 connection or proxied through a connected phone (i.e., via bluetooth).
 Prior to version 2.5.1, multiple weaknesses in the MQTT implementation
 allow for authentication and authorization bypasses resulting in
 unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes. Version 2.5.1 contains a
 patch.
