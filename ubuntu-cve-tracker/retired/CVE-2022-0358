Description:
 A flaw was found in the QEMU virtio-fs shared file system daemon
 (virtiofsd) implementation. This flaw is strictly related to
 CVE-2018-13405. A local guest user can create files in the directories
 shared by virtio-fs with unintended group ownership in a scenario where a
 directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a
 member of the group. This could allow a malicious unprivileged user inside
 the guest to gain access to resources accessible to the root group,
 potentially escalating their privileges within the guest. A malicious local
 user in the host might also leverage this unexpected executable file
 created by the guest to escalate their privileges on the host system.
