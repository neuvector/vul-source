Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** YASM v1.3.0 was discovered to contain a heap overflow via
 the function handle_dot_label at /nasm/nasm-token.re. Note: This has been
 disputed by third parties who argue this is a bug and not a security issue
 because yasm is a standalone program not designed to run untrusted code.
