Description:
 Google Chrome before 29 sends HTTP Cookie headers without first validating
 that they have the required character-set restrictions, which allows remote
 attackers to conduct the equivalent of a persistent Logout CSRF attack via
 a crafted parameter that forces a web application to set a malformed cookie
 within an HTTP response.
