Description:
 On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library
 was disclosed:
     A vulnerability in the HFS+ partition file parser of ClamAV versions
 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow
 an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
     This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may
 result in a heap buffer overflow write. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by
 ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
 to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV scanning
 process, or else crash the process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
 condition.
   For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog
 ["https://blog.clamav.net/"].
