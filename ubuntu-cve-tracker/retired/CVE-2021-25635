Description:
 An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed
 an attacker to self sign an ODF document, with a signature untrusted by
 the target, then modify it to change the signature algorithm to an
 invalid (or unknown to LibreOffice) algorithm and LibreOffice would
 incorrectly present such a signature with an unknown algorithm as a
 valid signature issued by a trusted person
 
 
 This issue affects LibreOffice: from 7.0 before 7.0.5, from 7.1 before
 7.1.1.
