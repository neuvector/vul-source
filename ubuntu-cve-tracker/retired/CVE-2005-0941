Description:
 The StgCompObjStream::Load function in OpenOffice.org OpenOffice 1.1.4 and
 earlier allocates memory based on 16 bit length values, but process memory
 using 32 bit values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a DOC document with certain
 length values, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
