Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in libpng 1.2.5 and earlier, as used in multiple
 products, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malformed
 PNG images in which (1) the png_handle_tRNS function does not properly
 validate the length of transparency chunk (tRNS) data, or the (2)
 png_handle_sBIT or (3) png_handle_hIST functions do not perform sufficient
 bounds checking.
