Description:
 Missing fixes for CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-26691 in the versions of
 httpd, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0, causes a security
 regression compared to the versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
 8.4. A user who installs or updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0 would
 be vulnerable to the mentioned CVEs, even if they were properly fixed in
 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. CVE-2021-20325 was assigned to that Red Hat
 specific security regression and it does not affect the upstream versions
 of httpd.
