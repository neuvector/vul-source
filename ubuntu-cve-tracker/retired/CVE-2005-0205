Description:
 KPPP 2.1.2 in KDE 3.1.5 and earlier, when setuid root without certain
 wrappers, does not properly close a privileged file descriptor for a domain
 socket, which allows local users to read and write to /etc/hosts and
 /etc/resolv.conf and gain control over DNS name resolution by opening a
 number of file descriptors before executing kppp.
