 The ThemeInstalledInfoBarDelegate::Observe function in
 browser/extensions/theme_installed_infobar_delegate.cc in Google Chrome
 before 8.0.552.224 and Chrome OS before 8.0.552.343 does not properly
 handle incorrect tab interaction by an extension, which allows
 user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) via a crafted extension.
