Description:
 net/socket/ssl_client_socket_nss.cc in the TLS implementation in Google
 Chrome before 31.0.1650.48 does not ensure that a server's X.509
 certificate is the same during renegotiation as it was before
 renegotiation, which might allow remote web servers to interfere with trust
 relationships by renegotiating a session.
