Description:
 The dissct_rsl_ipaccess_msg function in epan/dissectors/packet-rsl.c in the
 RSL dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does
 not reject unknown TLV types, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted
 packet.
