Description:
 A cross-protocol scripting issue was discovered in the management interface
 in OpenVPN through 2.4.5. When this interface is enabled over TCP without a
 password, and when no other clients are connected to this interface,
 attackers can execute arbitrary management commands, obtain sensitive
 information, or cause a denial of service (SIGTERM) by triggering
 XMLHttpRequest actions in a web browser. This is demonstrated by a
 multipart/form-data POST to http://localhost:23000 with a "signal SIGTERM"
 command in a TEXTAREA element. NOTE: The vendor disputes that this is a
 vulnerability. They state that this is the result of improper configuration
 of the OpenVPN instance rather than an intrinsic vulnerability, and now
 more explicitly warn against such configurations in both the
 management-interface documentation, and with a runtime warning
