Notes:
 mdeslaur> This is an Android CVE, as of 2022-09-16, there is no indication
 mdeslaur> what the issue is, what the fix is, and if the issue affects
 mdeslaur> the libnl3 package in Ubuntu.
 ccdm94> Looking at the libnl3 code and at the CVE description, a few of 
 ccdm94> the mentioned functions, types and variables can be found: function
 ccdm94> 'nla_parse' does exist, and 'nla_type' exists as well. The 
 ccdm94> 'policy[type]' access is also done. However, there seems to be no
 ccdm94> variable called 'para'. Therefore, looking only at the CVE
 ccdm94> description and at the only advisory made available by Android, it
 ccdm94> is not possible to determine, as of 2022-10-11, if libnl3 is
 ccdm94> vulnerable in any Ubuntu release. Upstream also has not released
 ccdm94> any commits that seems to be related to this issue, and, therefore,
 ccdm94> no current fix for libnl3 is avaiable if it is vulnerable.
 mdeslaur> no indication this affects Ubuntu, marking as not-affected
