Description:
 Integer overflow in xpath.c in libxml2 2.6.x through 2.6.32 and 2.7.x
 through 2.7.8, and libxml 1.8.16 and earlier, allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted XML file that triggers a heap-based buffer
 overflow when adding a new namespace node, related to handling of XPath
 expressions.
