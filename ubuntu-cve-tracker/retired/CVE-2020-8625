Description:
 BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are
 configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's
 default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can
 be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the
 tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although
 the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in
 networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server
 environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain
 controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the
 vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code
 execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0
 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1
 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition. Also release
 versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch
