Description:
 The virSecurityManagerGetPrivateData function in
 security/security_manager.c in libvirt 0.8.8 through 0.9.1 uses the wrong
 argument for a sizeof call, which causes incorrect processing of "security
 manager private data" that "reopens disk probing" and might allow guest OS
 users to read arbitrary files on the host OS. NOTE: this vulnerability
 exists because of a CVE-2010-2238 regression.
