Description:
 Versions of the package github.com/gin-gonic/gin before 1.9.0 are
 vulnerable to Improper Input Validation by allowing an attacker to use a
 specially crafted request via the X-Forwarded-Prefix header, potentially
 leading to cache poisoning. **Note:** Although this issue does not pose a
 significant threat on its own it can serve as an input vector for other
 more impactful vulnerabilities. However, successful exploitation may depend
 on the server configuration and whether the header is used in the
 application logic.
