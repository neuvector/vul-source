Description:
 Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
 clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
 address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.
 
 Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial
 of
 service.
 
 Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
 server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
 comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of
 an
 X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
 application program.
 
 Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is
 not
 affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
 specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.
 
 TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
 generally don't perform a name check against a reference identifier
 (expected
 identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
 certificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the
 severity
 of the issue is Moderate.
 
 The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
