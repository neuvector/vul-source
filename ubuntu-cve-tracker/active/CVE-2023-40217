Description:
 An issue was discovered in Python before 3.8.18, 3.9.x before 3.9.18,
 3.10.x before 3.10.13, and 3.11.x before 3.11.5. It primarily affects
 servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS
 server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and
 then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket
 instance will detect the socket as "not connected" and won't initiate a
 handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer.
 This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is
 expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from
 valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit
 in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data
 exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection
 be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)
