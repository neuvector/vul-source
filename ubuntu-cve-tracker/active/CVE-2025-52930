Description:
 A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the BMPv3 RLE Decoding
 functionality of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When decompressing
 the image data from a specially crafted .bmp file, a heap-based buffer
 overflow can occur which allows for remote code execution. An attacker will
 need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.
