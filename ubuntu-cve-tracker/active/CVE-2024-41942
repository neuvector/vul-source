Description:
 JupyterHub is software that allows one to create a multi-user server for
 Jupyter notebooks. Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0, if a user is granted
 the `admin:users` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by making
 themselves a full admin user. The impact is relatively small in that
 `admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to
 trusted users.
 In effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not
 intended. Note that the change here only prevents escalation to the
 built-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It does
 not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselves
 or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional.
 Versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0 fix this issue.
