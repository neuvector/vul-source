Description:
 MariaDB mariadb-dump Utility Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of MariaDB. Interaction with the
 mariadb-dump utility is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack
 vectors may vary depending on the implementation.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the handling of view names. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to
 using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
 execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-27000.
