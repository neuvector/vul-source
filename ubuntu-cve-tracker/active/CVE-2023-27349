Description:
 BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP Improper Validation of Array Index Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via Bluetooth on affected
 installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this
 vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious device. The
 specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which
 can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can
 leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was
 ZDI-CAN-19908.
