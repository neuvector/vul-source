Description:
 A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in a way when a Kerberos TGS-REQ is
 encrypted using the client’s session key. This key is different for each
 new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the
 ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly.
 For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal
 randomly-generated salt and the user’s password. If a principal is
 compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets
 encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key
 directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run
 brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when
 combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password).
