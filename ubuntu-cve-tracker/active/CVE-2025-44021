Description:
 OpenStack Ironic before 29.0.1 can write unintended files to a target node
 disk during image handling (if a deployment was performed via the API). A
 malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local
 file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the
 target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node
 deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still
 represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure
 configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions
 are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.
