Description:
 There is an invalid memory access in the function TextString::~TextString()
 located in Catalog.cc in Xpdf 4.0.2. It can be triggered by (for example)
 sending a crafted pdf file to the pdftohtml binary, which allows a remote
 attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact.
