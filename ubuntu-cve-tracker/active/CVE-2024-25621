Description:
 containerd is an open-source container runtime. Versions 0.1.0 through
 1.7.28, 2.0.0-beta.0 through 2.0.6, 2.1.0-beta.0 through 2.1.4 and
 2.2.0-beta.0 through 2.2.0-rc.1 have an overly broad default permission
 vulnerability. Directory paths `/var/lib/containerd`,
 `/run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri` and
 `/run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim` were all created
 with incorrect permissions. This issue is fixed in versions 1.7.29, 2.0.7,
 2.1.5 and 2.2.0. Workarounds include updating system administrator
 permissions so the host can manually chmod the directories to not have
 group or world accessible permissions, or to run containerd in rootless
 mode.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Traditionally the containerd source package contained both the
 alexmurray> library and docker application. However, in releases that
 alexmurray> contain the
 alexmurray> containerd-app source package, the containerd source package
 alexmurray> contains only
 alexmurray> the library whilst the docker application itself is contained
 alexmurray> in the
 alexmurray> containerd-app package.
