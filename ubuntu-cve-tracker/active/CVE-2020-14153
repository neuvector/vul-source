Description:
 In IJG JPEG (aka libjpeg) from version 8 through 9c, jdhuff.c has an
 out-of-bounds array read for certain table pointers.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> patch in libjpeg9 9d appears to be:
 mdeslaur>-      entropy->ac_cur_tbls[blkn] = entropy->ac_derived_tbls[compptr->ac_tbl_no];
 mdeslaur>+      entropy->ac_cur_tbls[blkn] =	/* AC needs no table when not present */
 mdeslaur>+	cinfo->lim_Se ? entropy->ac_derived_tbls[compptr->ac_tbl_no] : NULL;
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> per upstream libjpeg-turbo bug, libjpeg-turbo is not vulnerable
 mdeslaur> to this issue
 ccdm94> due to the same reasoning provided by the libjpeg-turbo upstream in issue
 ccdm94> https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/issues/445, it is safe to
 ccdm94> assume that libjpeg6b is also not vulnerable to this.
