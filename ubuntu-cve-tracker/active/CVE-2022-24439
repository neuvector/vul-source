Description:
 All versions of package gitpython are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
 (RCE) due to improper user input validation, which makes it possible to
 inject a maliciously crafted remote URL into the clone command. Exploiting
 this vulnerability is possible because the library makes external calls to
 git without sufficient sanitization of input arguments.
