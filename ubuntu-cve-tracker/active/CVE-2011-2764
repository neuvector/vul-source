Description:
 The FS_CheckFilenameIsNotExecutable function in qcommon/files.c in the
 ioQuake3 engine 1.36 and earlier, as used in World of Padman, Smokin' Guns,
 OpenArena, Tremulous, and ioUrbanTerror, does not properly determine
 dangerous file extensions, which allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted third-party addon that creates a Trojan horse
 DLL file.
