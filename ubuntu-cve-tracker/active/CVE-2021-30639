Description:
 A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to remotely trigger a
 denial of service. An error introduced as part of a change to improve error
 handling during non-blocking I/O meant that the error flag associated with
 the Request object was not reset between requests. This meant that once a
 non-blocking I/O error occurred, all future requests handled by that
 request object would fail. Users were able to trigger non-blocking I/O
 errors, e.g. by dropping a connection, thereby creating the possibility of
 triggering a DoS. Applications that do not use non-blocking I/O are not
 exposed to this vulnerability. This issue affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.3 to
 10.0.4; 9.0.44; 8.5.64.
