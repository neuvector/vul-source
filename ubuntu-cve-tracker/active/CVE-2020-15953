Description:
 LibEtPan through 1.9.4, as used in MailCore 2 through 0.6.3 and other
 products, has a STARTTLS buffering issue that affects IMAP, SMTP, and POP3.
 When a server sends a "begin TLS" response, the client reads additional
 data (e.g., from a meddler-in-the-middle attacker) and evaluates it in a
 TLS context, aka "response injection."
