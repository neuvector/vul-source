Description:
 A vulnerability stemming from floating-point arithmetic precision errors
 exists in the QuickJS engine's implementation of
 TypedArray.prototype.indexOf() when a negative fromIndex argument is
 supplied.
 
   *  The fromIndex argument (read as a double variable, $d$) is used to
 calculate the starting position for the search.
 
 
   *  If d is negative, the index is calculated relative to the end of the
 array by adding the array's length (len) to d:
 
 
 
 $$d_{new} = d + \text{len}$$
 
 
   *  Due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic, if the
 negative value $d$ is extremely small (e.g., $-1 \times 10^{-20}$), the
 addition $d + \text{len}$ can result in a loss of precision, yielding an
 outcome that is exactly equal to $\text{len}$.
 
 
   *  The result is then converted to an integer index $k$: $k =
 \text{len}$.
 
 
   *  The search function proceeds to read array elements starting from
 index $k$. Since valid indices are $0$ to $\text{len}-1$, starting the read
 at index $\text{len}$ is one element past the end of the array.
 
 
 This allows an attacker to cause an Out-of-Bounds Read of one element
 immediately following the buffer. While the scope of this read is small
 (one element), it can potentially lead to Information Disclosure of
 adjacent memory contents, depending on the execution environment.
