Description:
 oFono CUSD Stack-based Buffer Overflow Code Execution Vulnerability. This
 vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
 installations of oFono. An attacker must first obtain the ability to
 execute code on the target modem in order to exploit this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of responses from AT+CUSD
 commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the
 length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer.
 An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context
 of root. Was ZDI-CAN-23195.
