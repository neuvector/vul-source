Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Starting with the 8.1 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability
 affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible
 due to map attributions weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary
 JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized user
 of the Grafana instance. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order
 to change a panel to include a map attribution containing JavaScript. This
 means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with
 Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if
 the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.
 Users may upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.
