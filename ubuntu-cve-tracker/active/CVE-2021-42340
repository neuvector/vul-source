Description:
 The fix for bug 63362 present in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M5,
 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.11, 9.0.40 to 9.0.53 and 8.5.60 to 8.5.71 introduced a
 memory leak. The object introduced to collect metrics for HTTP upgrade
 connections was not released for WebSocket connections once the connection
 was closed. This created a memory leak that, over time, could lead to a
 denial of service via an OutOfMemoryError.
