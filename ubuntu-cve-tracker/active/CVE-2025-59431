Description:
 MapServer is a system for developing web-based GIS applications. Prior to
 8.4.1, the XML Filter Query directive PropertyName is vulnerably to
 Boolean-based SQL injection. It seems like expression checking is bypassed
 by introducing double quote characters in the PropertyName. Allowing to
 manipulate backend database queries. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.4.1.
