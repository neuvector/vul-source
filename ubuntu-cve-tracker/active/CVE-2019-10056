Description:
 An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The code mishandles the case of
 sending a network packet with the right type, such that the function
 DecodeEthernet in decode-ethernet.c is executed a second time. At this
 point, the algorithm cuts the first part of the packet and doesn't
 determine the current length. Specifically, if the packet is exactly 28
 long, in the first iteration it subtracts 14 bytes. Then, it is working
 with a packet length of 14. At this point, the case distinction says it is
 a valid packet. After that it casts the packet, but this packet has no
 type, and the program crashes at the type case distinction.
