Description:
 symfony/validator is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides
 tools to validate values. It is possible to trick a `Validator` configured
 with a regular expression using the `$` metacharacters, with an input
 ending with `\n`. Symfony as of versions 5.4.43, 6.4.11, and 7.1.4 now uses
 the `D` regex modifier to match the entire input. Users are advised to
 upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
