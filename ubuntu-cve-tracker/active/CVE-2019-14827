Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Moodle where javaScript injection was possible
 in some Mustache templates via recursive rendering from contexts. Mustache
 helper tags that were included in template contexts were not being escaped
 before that context was injected into another Mustache helper, which could
 result in script injection in some templates. This affects versions 3.7 to
 3.7.1, 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.5 to 3.5.7 and earlier unsupported versions.
