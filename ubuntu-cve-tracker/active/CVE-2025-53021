Description:
 A session fixation vulnerability in Moodle 3.x through 3.11.18 allows
 unauthenticated attackers to hijack user sessions via the sesskey
 parameter. The sesskey can be obtained without authentication and reused
 within the OAuth2 login flow, resulting in the victim's session being
 linked to the attacker's. Successful exploitation results in full account
 takeover. According to the Moodle Releases page, "Bug fixes for security
 issues in 3.11.x ended 11 December 2023." NOTE: This vulnerability only
 affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.
