Description:
 Flysystem is an open source file storage library for PHP. The whitespace
 normalisation using in 1.x and 2.x removes any unicode whitespace. Under
 certain specific conditions this could potentially allow a malicious user
 to execute code remotely. The conditions are: A user is allowed to supply
 the path or filename of an uploaded file, the supplied path or filename is
 not checked against unicode chars, the supplied pathname checked against an
 extension deny-list, not an allow-list, the supplied path or filename
 contains a unicode whitespace char in the extension, the uploaded file is
 stored in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed. Given these
 conditions are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the
 system under attack. The unicode whitespace removal has been replaced with
 a rejection (exception). For 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users,
 upgrade to 2.1.1.
