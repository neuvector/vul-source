Description:
 ReactPHP HTTP is a streaming HTTP client and server implementation for
 ReactPHP. In ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions starting with 0.7.0
 and prior to 1.7.0, when ReactPHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie
 values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies with
 prefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-` confused with cookies that decode
 to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie
 which is supposed to be secure. This issue is fixed in ReactPHP HTTP
 version 1.7.0. As a workaround, Infrastructure or DevOps can place a
 reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any
 unexpected `Cookie` request headers.
