Description:
 Gunicorn version 21.2.0 does not properly validate the value of the
 'Transfer-Encoding' header as specified in the RFC standards, which leads
 to the default fallback method of 'Content-Length,' making it vulnerable to
 TE.CL request smuggling. This vulnerability can lead to cache poisoning,
 data exposure, session manipulation, SSRF, XSS, DoS, data integrity
 compromise, security bypass, information leakage, and business logic abuse.
