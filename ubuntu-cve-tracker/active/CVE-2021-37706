Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
 STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming STUN message
 contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header length is not checked before
 performing a subtraction operation, potentially resulting in an integer
 underflow scenario. This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious
 actor located within the victim’s network may forge and send a specially
 crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on
 the victim’s machine. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
 There are no known workarounds.
