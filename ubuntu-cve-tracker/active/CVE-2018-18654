Description:
 Crossroads 2.81 does not properly handle the /tmp directory during a build
 of xr. A local attacker can first create a world-writable subdirectory in a
 certain location under the /tmp directory, wait until a user process copies
 xr there, and then replace the entire contents of this subdirectory to
 include a Trojan horse xr.
