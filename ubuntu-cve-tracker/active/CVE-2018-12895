Description:
 WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code by
 leveraging directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter,
 which is passed to the PHP unlink function and can delete the wp-config.php
 file. This is related to missing filename validation in the
 wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have
 capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the
 Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to
 delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase
 the attacker's privileges.
