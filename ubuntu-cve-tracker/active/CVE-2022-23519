Description:
 rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails
 applications. Prior to version 1.4.4, a possible XSS vulnerability with
 certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to
 inject content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's
 allowed tags in either of the following ways: allow both "math" and "style"
 elements,  or allow both "svg" and "style" elements. Code is only impacted
 if allowed tags are being overridden. . This issue is fixed in version
 1.4.4. All users overriding the allowed tags to include "math" or "svg" and
 "style" should either upgrade or use the following workaround immediately:
 Remove "style" from the overridden allowed tags, or remove "math" and "svg"
 from the overridden allowed tags.
