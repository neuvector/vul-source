Description:
 The OWASP core rule set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules
 for use with compatible web application firewalls. Prior to versions 4.22.0
 and 3.3.8, the current rule 922110 has a bug when processing multipart
 requests with multiple parts. When the first rule in a chain iterates over
 a collection (like `MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS`), the capture variables
 (`TX:0`, `TX:1`) get overwritten with each iteration. Only the last
 captured value is available to the chained rule, which means malicious
 charsets in earlier parts can be missed if a later part has a legitimate
 charset. Versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8 patch the issue.
