Description:
 quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. In versions prior
 to 0.49.0, 0.54.1, and 0.55.0, a misbehaving or malicious server can cause
 a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the quic-go client by triggering an
 assertion failure, leading to a process crash. This requires no
 authentication and can be exploited during the handshake phase. This was
 observed in the wild with certain server implementations. quic-go needs to
 be able to handle misbehaving server implementations, including those that
 prematurely send a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame. Versions 0.49.0, 0.54.1, and
 0.55.0 discard Initial keys when receiving a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame, thereby
 correctly handling premature HANDSHAKE_DONE frames.
