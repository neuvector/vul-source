Description:
 An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4
 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library
 v1.0.1. When processing the 'hdlr' FOURCC code, a specially crafted MPEG-4
 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based
 buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a
 user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.
