Description:
 A vulnerability in corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 allows the
 `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network` CORS header to be set to true by
 default. This behavior can expose private network resources to unauthorized
 external access, leading to significant security risks such as data
 breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential
 network intrusions.
