Description:
 Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty
 hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram
 (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log
 dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can
 enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down
 the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode
 (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive
 locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in
 already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.
