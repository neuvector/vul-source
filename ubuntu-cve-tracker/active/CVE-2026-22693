Description:
 HarfBuzz is a text shaping engine. Prior to version 12.3.0, a null pointer
 dereference vulnerability exists in the SubtableUnicodesCache::create
 function located in src/hb-ot-cmap-table.hh. The function fails to check if
 hb_malloc returns NULL before using placement new to construct an object at
 the returned pointer address. When hb_malloc fails to allocate memory
 (which can occur in low-memory conditions or when using custom allocators
 that simulate allocation failures), it returns NULL. The code then attempts
 to call the constructor on this null pointer using placement new syntax,
 resulting in undefined behavior and a Segmentation Fault. This issue has
 been patched in version 12.3.0.
