Description:
 GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in
 crafted TAR archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim
 must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical
 directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a
 critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the
 symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction
 follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the
 protection mechanism of "Member name contains '..'" that would occur for a
 single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../
 approach. For example, the first archive can contain "x ->
 ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh" and the second archive can contain
 x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically
 extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the
 blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes
 in which "tar xf" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package
 can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted
 tarballs instead of official packages).
