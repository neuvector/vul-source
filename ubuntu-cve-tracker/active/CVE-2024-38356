Description:
 TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s content extraction code. When
 using the `noneditable_regexp` option, specially crafted HTML attributes
 containing malicious code were able to be executed when content was
 extracted from the editor. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE
 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that, when using
 the `noneditable_regexp` option, any content within an attribute is
 properly verified to match the configured regular expression before being
 added. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
 this vulnerability.
