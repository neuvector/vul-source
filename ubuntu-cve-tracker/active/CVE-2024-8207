 https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-69507
Description:
 In certain highly specific configurations of the host system and MongoDB
 server binary installation on Linux Operating Systems, it may be possible
 for a unintended actor with host-level access to cause the MongoDB Server
 binary to load unintended actor-controlled shared libraries when the server
 binary is started, potentially resulting in the unintended actor gaining
 full control over the MongoDB server process. This issue affects MongoDB
 Server v5.0 versions prior to 5.0.14 and MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior
 to 6.0.3.
 
 Required Configuration: Only environments with Linux as the underlying
 operating system is affected by this issue
