Description:
 TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s content insertion code. This
 allowed `iframe` elements containing malicious code to execute when
 inserted into the editor. These `iframe` elements are restricted in their
 permissions by same-origin browser protections, but could still trigger
 operations such as downloading of malicious assets. This vulnerability is
 fixed in 6.8.1.
