Description:
 A Bleichenbacher type side-channel based padding oracle attack was found in
 the way gnutls handles verification of RSA decrypted PKCS#1 v1.5 data. An
 attacker who is able to run process on the same physical core as the victim
 process, could use this to extract plaintext or in some cases downgrade any
 TLS connections to a vulnerable server.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Fixing this requires fixing CVE-2018-16869 in nettle first, but
 mdeslaur> nettle changes are too intrusive to backport to stable releases.
 mdeslaur> In addition, the upstream gnutls28 fix appears to break OpenPGP
 mdeslaur> support when backported to the version in bionic.
