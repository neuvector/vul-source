Description:
 Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior
 to versions 2.2.11, 3.0.12, and 3.1.11, Rack::CommonLogger can be exploited
 by crafting input that includes newline characters to manipulate log
 entries. The supplied proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious
 content into logs. When a user provides the authorization credentials via
 Rack::Auth::Basic, if success, the username will be put in
 env['REMOTE_USER'] and later be used by Rack::CommonLogger for logging
 purposes. The issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally
 allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white space
 characters, or the server just want to log every login attempts. If an
 attacker enters a username with CRLF character, the logger will log the
 malicious username with CRLF characters into the logfile. Attackers can
 break log formats or insert fraudulent entries, potentially obscuring real
 activity or injecting malicious data into log files. Versions 2.2.11,
 3.0.12, and 3.1.11 contain a fix.
