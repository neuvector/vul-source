Description:
 rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails
 applications. Prior to version 1.4.4, there is a possible XSS vulnerability
 with certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer due to an incomplete
 fix of CVE-2022-32209. Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to
 inject content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's
 allowed tags to allow both "select" and "style" elements. Code is only
 impacted if allowed tags are being overridden. This issue is patched in
 version 1.4.4. All users overriding the allowed tags to include both
 "select" and "style" should either upgrade or use this workaround: Remove
 either "select" or "style" from the overridden allowed tags. NOTE: Code is
 _not_ impacted if allowed tags are overridden using either the :tags option
 to the Action View helper method sanitize or the :tags option to the
 instance method SafeListSanitizer#sanitize.
