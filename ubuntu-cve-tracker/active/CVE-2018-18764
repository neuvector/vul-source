Description:
 An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT
 packet-parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.13. It is a heap-based
 buffer over-read in a parse_mqtt getu16 call. A specially crafted MQTT
 SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory read
 potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An
 attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to
 trigger this vulnerability.
