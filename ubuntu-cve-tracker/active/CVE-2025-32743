Description:
 In ConnMan through 1.44, the lookup string in ns_resolv in dnsproxy.c can
 be NULL or an empty string when the TC (Truncated) bit is set in a DNS
 response. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, because those lookup values lead
 to incorrect length calculations and incorrect memcpy operations.
