Description:
 Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP
 Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert
 escape characters into log files in some configurations.
 
 In a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with "%{varname}x" or
 "%{varname}c" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no
 escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized
 data provided by the client may appear in log files.
