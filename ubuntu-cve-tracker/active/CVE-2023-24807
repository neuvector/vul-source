Description:
 Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Prior to version 5.19.1, the
 `Headers.set()` and `Headers.append()` methods are vulnerable to Regular
 Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks when untrusted values are
 passed into the functions. This is due to the inefficient regular
 expression used to normalize the values in the `headerValueNormalize()`
 utility function. This vulnerability was patched in v5.19.1. No known
 workarounds are available.
