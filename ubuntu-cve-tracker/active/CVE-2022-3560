Description:
 A flaw was found in pesign. The pesign package provides a systemd service
 used to start the pesign daemon. This service unit runs a script to set
 ACLs for /etc/pki/pesign and /run/pesign directories to grant access
 privileges to users in the 'pesign' group. However, the script doesn't
 check for symbolic links. This could allow an attacker to gain access to
 privileged files and directories via a path traversal attack.
