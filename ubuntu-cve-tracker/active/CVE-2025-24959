Description:
 zx is a tool for writing better scripts. An attacker with control over
 environment variable values can inject unintended environment variables
 into `process.env`. This can lead to arbitrary command execution or
 unexpected behavior in applications that rely on environment variables for
 security-sensitive operations. Applications that process untrusted input
 and pass it through `dotenv.stringify` are particularly vulnerable. This
 issue has been patched in version 8.3.2. Users should immediately upgrade
 to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. If upgrading is not
 feasible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by sanitizing
 user-controlled environment variable values before passing them to
 `dotenv.stringify`. Specifically, avoid using `"`, `'`, and backticks in
 values, or enforce strict validation of environment variables before usage.
