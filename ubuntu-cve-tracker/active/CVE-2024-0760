Description:
 A malicious client can send many DNS messages over TCP, potentially causing
 the server to become unstable while the attack is in progress. The server
 may recover after the attack ceases. Use of ACLs will not mitigate the
 attack.
 This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.18.1 through 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through
 9.19.24, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> in focal and jammy, isc-dhcp uses the bind9-libs package
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
 mdeslaur> This issue doesn't appear to affect version older than 9.18
