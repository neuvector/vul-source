Description:
 The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14,
 and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to
 insufficient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent
 extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative
 paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved
 by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained
 in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into
 `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained
 repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only
 strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path
 with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`)
 would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file
 creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14,
 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading
 by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a
 `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced
 GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a
 similar bug in later versions of tar.
