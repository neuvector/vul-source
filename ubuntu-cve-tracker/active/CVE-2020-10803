Description:
 In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5 and 5.x before 5.0.2, a SQL injection
 vulnerability was discovered where malicious code could be used to trigger
 an XSS attack through retrieving and displaying results (in
 tbl_get_field.php and libraries/classes/Display/Results.php). The attacker
 must be able to insert crafted data into certain database tables, which
 when retrieved (for instance, through the Browse tab) can trigger the XSS
 attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that phpMyAdmin did not properly handle data from the
 database when displaying it. If an attacker were to insert specially-crafted
 data into certain database tables, the attacker could execute a cross-site
 scripting (XSS) attack.
