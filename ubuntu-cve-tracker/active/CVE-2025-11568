Description:
 A data corruption vulnerability has been identified in the luksmeta utility
 when used with the LUKS1 disk encryption format. An attacker with the
 necessary permissions can exploit this flaw by writing a large amount of
 metadata to an encrypted device. The utility fails to correctly validate
 the available space, causing the metadata to overwrite and corrupt the
 user's encrypted data. This action leads to a permanent loss of the stored
 information. Devices using the LUKS formats other than LUKS1 are not
 affected by this issue.
