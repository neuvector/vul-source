Description:
 net-tools is a collection of programs that form the base set of the NET-3
 networking distribution for the Linux operating system. Inn versions up to
 and including 2.10, the Linux network utilities (like ifconfig) from the
 net-tools package do not properly validate the structure of /proc files
 when showing interfaces. `get_name()` in `interface.c` copies interface
 labels from `/proc/net/dev` into a fixed 16-byte stack buffer without
 bounds checking, leading to possible arbitrary code execution or crash. The
 known attack path does not require privilege but also does not provide
 privilege escalation in this scenario. A patch is available and expected to
 be part of version 2.20.
