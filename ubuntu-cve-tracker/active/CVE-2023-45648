Description:
 Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from
 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1
 through 9.0.81 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.93 did not correctly parse HTTP
 trailer headers. A specially crafted, invalid trailer header could cause
 Tomcat to treat a single request as multiple requests leading to the
 possibility of request smuggling when behind a reverse proxy. Users are
 recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14 onwards,
 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fix the issue.
