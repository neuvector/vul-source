Description:
 Under certain circumstances, BIND is too lenient when accepting records
 from answers, allowing an attacker to inject forged data into the cache.
 This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through
 9.18.39, 9.20.0 through 9.20.13, 9.21.0 through 9.21.12, 9.11.3-S1 through
 9.16.50-S1, 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.39-S1, and 9.20.9-S1 through
 9.20.13-S1.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> in focal and jammy, isc-dhcp uses the bind9-libs package
 mdeslaur> per upstream, 9.11+, need to check
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
