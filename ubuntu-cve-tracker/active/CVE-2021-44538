Description:
 The olm_session_describe function in Matrix libolm before 3.2.7 is
 vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The Olm session object represents a
 cryptographic channel between two parties. Therefore, its state is
 partially controllable by the remote party of the channel. Attackers can
 construct a crafted sequence of messages to manipulate the state of the
 receiver's session in such a way that, for some buffer sizes, a buffer
 overflow happens on a call to olm_session_describe. Furthermore, safe
 buffer sizes were undocumented. The overflow content is partially
 controllable by the attacker and limited to ASCII spaces and digits. The
 known affected products are Element Web And SchildiChat Web.
