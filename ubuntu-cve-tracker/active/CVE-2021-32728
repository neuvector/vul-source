Description:
 The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud
 Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption
 feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In
 versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a
 private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the
 Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be
 encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor.
 This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no
 known workarounds aside from upgrading.
