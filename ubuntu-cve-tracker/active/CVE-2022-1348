Description:
 A vulnerability was found in logrotate in how the state file is created.
 The state file is used to prevent parallel executions of multiple instances
 of logrotate by acquiring and releasing a file lock. When the state file
 does not exist, it is created with world-readable permission, allowing an
 unprivileged user to lock the state file, stopping any rotation. This flaw
 affects logrotate versions before 3.20.0.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray| Only affects logrotate >= 3.17.0
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu packages build with:
 mdeslaur> --with-state-file-path=/var/lib/logrotate/status
 mdeslaur> but the /var/lib/logrotate directory itself is 755, so a
 mdeslaur> user can get a lock on the file.
 mdeslaur> See follow-up pull request with additional fix
