Description:
 cpdb-libs provides frontend and backend libraries for the Common Printing
 Dialog Backends (CPDB) project. In versions 1.0 through 2.0b4, cpdb-libs is
 vulnerable to buffer overflows via improper use of `scanf(3)`. cpdb-libs
 uses the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions to parse command lines and
 configuration files, dropping the read string components into fixed-length
 buffers, but does not limit the length of the strings to be read by
 `fscanf()` and `scanf()` causing buffer overflows when a string is longer
 than 1023 characters. A patch for this issue is available at commit
 f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7. As all buffers have a length of
 1024 characters, the patch limits the maximum string length to be read to
 1023 by replacing all occurrences of `%s` with `%1023s` in all calls of the
 `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions.
