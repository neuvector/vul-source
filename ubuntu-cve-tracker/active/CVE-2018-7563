Description:
 An issue was discovered in GLPI through 9.2.1. The application is affected
 by XSS in the query string to front/preference.php. An attacker is able to
 create a malicious URL that, if opened by an authenticated user with debug
 privilege, will execute JavaScript code supplied by the attacker. The
 attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as
 stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing
 arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.
