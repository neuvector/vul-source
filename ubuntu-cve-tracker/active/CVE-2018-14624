Description:
 A vulnerability was discovered in 389-ds-base through versions 1.3.7.10,
 1.3.8.8 and 1.4.0.16. The lock controlling the error log was not correctly
 used when re-opening the log file in log__error_emergency(). An attacker
 could send a flood of modifications to a very large DN, which would cause
 slapd to crash.
