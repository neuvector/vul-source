Description:
 Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for
 multi-language development. When copying or archiving symlinked files,
 Gradle resolves them but applies the permissions of the symlink itself
 instead of the permissions of the linked file to the resulting file. This
 leads to files having too much permissions given that symlinks usually are
 world readable and writeable. While it is unlikely this results in a direct
 vulnerability for the impacted build, it may open up attack vectors
 depending on where build artifacts end up being copied to or un-archived.
 In versions 7.6.3, 8.4 and above, Gradle will now properly use the
 permissions of the file pointed at by the symlink to set permissions of the
 copied or archived file.
