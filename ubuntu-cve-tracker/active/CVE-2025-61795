Description:
 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.
 
 If an error occurred (including exceeding limits) during the processing of
 a multipart upload, temporary copies of the uploaded parts written to disc
 were not cleaned up immediately but left for the garbage collection process
 to delete. Depending on JVM settings, application memory usage and
 application load, it was possible that space for the temporary copies of
 uploaded parts would be filled faster than GC cleared it, leading to a DoS.
 
 
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.11, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.46, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.109.
 
 The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are
 known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may
 also be affected.
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.12 or later, 10.1.47 or
 later or 9.0.110 or later which fixes the issue.
