Description:
 Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In
 affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided
 maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When
 parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count
 * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and
 the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a
 short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis who are
 unable to update may set the
 [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements)
 context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> This feels like a bug in calloc() implementation, not in
  Hiredis. I'm marking this not-affected for us because our calloc(3)
  should do the right thing.
