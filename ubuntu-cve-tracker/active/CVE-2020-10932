Description:
 An issue was discovered in Arm Mbed TLS before 2.16.6 and 2.7.x before
 2.7.15. An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel measurements
 can recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing the
 projective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication by exploiting
 side channels in the conversion to affine coordinates; (2) using an attack
 described by Naccache, Smart, and Stern in 2003 to recover a few bits of
 the ephemeral scalar from those projective coordinates via several
 measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack to get from there to the
 long-term ECDSA private key used for the signatures. Typically an attacker
 would have sufficient access when attacking an SGX enclave and controlling
 the untrusted OS.
