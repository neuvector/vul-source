Description:
 A flaw was found in QEMU. If the QIOChannelWebsock object is freed while it
 is waiting to complete a handshake, a GSource is leaked. This can lead to
 the callback firing later on and triggering a use-after-free in the use of
 the channel. This can be abused by a malicious client with network access
 to the VNC WebSocket port to cause a denial of service during the WebSocket
 handshake prior to the VNC client authentication.
