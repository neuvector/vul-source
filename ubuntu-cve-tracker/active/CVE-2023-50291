Description:
 Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr. This
 issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before
 9.3.0. One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java
 system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system
 properties that had "password" contained in the name. There are a number of
 sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not
 contain "password", thus their values were published via the
 "/admin/info/properties" endpoint. This endpoint populates the list of
 System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the
 exposed credentials visible in the UI. This /admin/info/properties endpoint
 is protected under the "config-read" permission. Therefore, Solr Clouds
 with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users
 that have the "config-read" permission. Users are recommended to upgrade to
 version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue. A single option now
 controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints,
 "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps". By default all known sensitive properties are
 hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name
 containing "secret" or "password". Users who cannot upgrade can also use
 the following Java system property to fix the issue:
 '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'
