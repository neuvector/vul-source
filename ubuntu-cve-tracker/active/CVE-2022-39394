Description:
 Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2,
 there is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition of
 the `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared signature in the
 `wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This discrepancy causes the function
 implementation to perform a 4-byte write into a 1-byte buffer provided by
 the caller. This can lead to three zero bytes being written beyond the
 1-byte location provided by the caller. This bug has been patched and users
 should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by
 providing a 4-byte buffer casted to a 1-byte buffer when calling
 `wasmtime_trap_code`. Users of the `wasmtime` crate are not affected by
 this issue, only users of the C API function `wasmtime_trap_code` are
 affected.
