Description:
 When asked to use a `.netrc` file for credentials **and** to follow HTTP
 redirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to the
 followed-to host under certain circumstances.
 
 This flaw only manifests itself if the netrc file has a `default` entry
 that
 omits both login and password. A rare circumstance.
