Description:
 When api-config-dir is set to a non-empty value, which is not the case by
 default, the API in PowerDNS Recursor 4.x up to and including 4.0.6 and 3.x
 up to and including 3.7.4 allows an authorized user to update the
 Recursor's ACL by adding and removing netmasks, and to configure forward
 zones. It was discovered that the new netmask and IP addresses of forwarded
 zones were not sufficiently validated, allowing an authenticated user to
 inject new configuration directives into the Recursor's configuration.
