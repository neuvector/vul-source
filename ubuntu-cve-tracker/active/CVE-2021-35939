Description:
 It was found that the fix for CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501 was
 incomplete: the check was only implemented for the parent directory of the
 file to be created. A local unprivileged user who owns another ancestor
 directory could potentially use this flaw to gain root privileges. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and
 integrity as well as system availability.
