Description:
 libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the `GTime2str()` function, used for parsing
 an
 ASN.1 Generalized Time field. If given an syntactically incorrect field,
 the
 parser might end up using -1 for the length of the *time fraction*, leading
 to
 a `strlen()` getting performed on a pointer to a heap buffer area that is
 not
 (purposely) null terminated.
 
 This flaw most likely leads to a crash, but can also lead to heap contents
 getting returned to the application when
 [CURLINFO_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLINFO_CERTINFO.html) is
 used.
