Description:
 Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix
 releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE)
 attack when a configuration uses a JDBC Appender with a JNDI LDAP data
 source URI when an attacker has control of the target LDAP server. This
 issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in
 Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.
