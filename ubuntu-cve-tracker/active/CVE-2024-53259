Description:
 quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path
 attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go
 versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the kernel would then return a "message too
 large" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that
 exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to
 smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can
 disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of
 the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be
 implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back
 to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The
 attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an
 attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.
