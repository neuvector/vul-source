Description:
 A flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message digest
 (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto backends. The
 return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause
 low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the
 uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching
 keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the
 connection.
