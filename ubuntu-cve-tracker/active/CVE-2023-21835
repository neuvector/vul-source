Description:
 Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition
 product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported versions that are
 affected are Oracle Java SE: 11.0.17, 17.0.5, 19.0.1; Oracle GraalVM
 Enterprise Edition: 20.3.8, 21.3.4 and 22.3.0. Easily exploitable
 vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via DTLS
 to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful
 attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a
 partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM
 Enterprise Edition. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
 typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
 sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
 comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
 that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS
 Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).
Ubuntu-Description:
 Juraj Somorovsky, Marcel Maehren, Nurullah Erinola, and Robert
 Merget discovered that the DTLS implementation in the JSSE subsystem
 of OpenJDK did not properly restrict handshake initiation requests
 from clients. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a
 denial of service.
Notes:
 sbeattie> after applying this update, the Sun JSSE DTLS implementation
   will by default exchange cookies for all handshakes (new and resumed)
   unless the System property jdk.tls.enableDtlsResumeCookie is false. The
   property only affects the cookie exchange for resumption.
 sbeattie> does not affect OpenJDK 8
