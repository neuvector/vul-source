Description:
 WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in
 PHP and paired with a MariaDB database. Due to improper sanitization in
 WP_Query, there can be cases where SQL injection is possible through
 plugins or themes that use it in a certain way. This has been patched in
 WordPress version 5.8.3. Older affected versions are also fixed via
 security release, that go back till 3.7.37. We strongly recommend that you
 keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
