Description:
 Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS
 certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP
 address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an
 attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as
 well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In
 httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is vulnerable to an
 Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap Overflow allowing for
 remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine. The
 Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage Engine
 server, and the agent calling "HttpQueryInfoW" in order to get the
 "Content-Length" size from the incoming POST request. This size is taken,
 but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a
 Content-Length size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will
 wrap the value back around to smaller integer, then calls "calloc" with
 this size to allocate memory. The following API "InternetReadFile" will
 copy the POST data into this buffer, which will be too small for the
 contents, and cause heap overflow.
