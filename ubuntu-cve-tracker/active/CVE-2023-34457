Description:
 MechanicalSoup is a Python library for automating interaction with
 websites. Starting in version 0.2.0 and prior to version 1.3.0, a malicious
 web server can read arbitrary files on the client using a `<input
 type="file" ...>` inside HTML form. All users of MechanicalSoup's form
 submission are affected, unless they took very specific (and manual) steps
 to reset HTML form field values. Version 1.3.0 contains a patch for this
 issue.
