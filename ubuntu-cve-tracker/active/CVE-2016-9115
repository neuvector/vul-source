Notes:
 ccdm94> Pull request 895 seems to be an initial attempt to fix this
 ccdm94> issue. However, pull request 895 was never merged, and instead,
 ccdm94> five issues which did not include issue 856 were fixed by
 ccdm94> various commits created by upstream (these can be seen in PR
 ccdm94> 895) which utilized part of what was being proposed in 895 by
 ccdm94> an openjpeg contributor. The changes proposed in 895 that were
 ccdm94> not added by the upstream commits previously mentioned were
 ccdm94> added to a new pull request, 975, which attempts to fix various
 ccdm94> issues. Looking at comments in issue 863 it was possible to
 ccdm94> verify that the fix for CVE-2016-9114 is possibly commit
 ccdm94> 2fa0fc61f2d (see CVE-2016-9114 for more details). This CVE
 ccdm94> mentions a vulnerability similar to the one we have here in
 ccdm94> CVE-2016-9115. Therefore, looking at the patch for CVE-2016-9114
 ccdm94> and looking at the changes proposed by PR 975, it seems like
 ccdm94> the changes in this PR aim to address CVE-2016-9115 in a way
 ccdm94> similar to the one used to address CVE-2016-9114. PR 975 was
 ccdm94> merged, however, it introduced regressions. See PR in order
 ccdm94> to verify changes made after it was merged in order to fix
 ccdm94> introduced regressions if adding patch.
