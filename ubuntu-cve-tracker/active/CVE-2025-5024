Description:
 A flaw was found in gnome-remote-desktop. Once gnome-remote-desktop listens
 for RDP connections, an unauthenticated attacker can exhaust system
 resources and repeatedly crash the process. There may be a resource leak
 after many attacks, which will also result in gnome-remote-desktop no
 longer being able to open files even after it is restarted via systemd.
