Description:
 Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of
 presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.45
 and 4.1.1, template authors could inject php code by choosing a malicious
 {block} name or {include} file name. Sites that cannot fully trust template
 authors should upgrade to versions 3.1.45 or 4.1.1 to receive a patch for
 this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.
