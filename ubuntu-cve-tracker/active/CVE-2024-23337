Description:
 jq is a command-line JSON processor. In versions up to and including 1.7.1,
 an integer overflow arises when assigning value using an index of
 2147483647, the signed integer limit. This causes a denial of service.
 Commit de21386681c0df0104a99d9d09db23a9b2a78b1e contains a patch for the
 issue.
