Description:
 When GNOME Dia before 2019-11-27 is launched with a filename argument that
 is not a valid codepoint in the current encoding, it enters an endless
 loop, thus endlessly writing text to stdout. If this launch is from a
 thumbnailer service, this output will usually be written to disk via the
 system's logging facility (potentially with elevated privileges), thus
 filling up the disk and eventually rendering the system unusable. (The
 filename can be for a nonexistent file.) NOTE: this does not affect an
 upstream release, but affects certain Linux distribution packages with
 version numbers such as 0.97.3.
