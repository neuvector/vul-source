 https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6714
 https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.7.8
Description:
 In axios before 1.7.8, lib/helpers/isURLSameOrigin.js does not use a URL
 object when determining an origin, and has a potentially unwanted
 setAttribute('href',href) call. NOTE: some parties feel that the code
 change only addresses a warning message from a SAST tool and does not fix a
 vulnerability.
