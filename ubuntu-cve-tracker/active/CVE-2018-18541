Description:
 In Teeworlds before 0.6.5, connection packets could be forged. There was no
 challenge-response involved in the connection build up. A remote attacker
 could send connection packets from a spoofed IP address and occupy all
 server slots, or even use them for a reflection attack using map download
 packets.
