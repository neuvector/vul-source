Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Unbound before 1.9.5 allows configuration injection in
 create_unbound_ad_servers.sh upon a successful man-in-the-middle attack
 against a cleartext HTTP session. NOTE: The vendor does not consider this a
 vulnerability of the Unbound software. create_unbound_ad_servers.sh is a
 contributed script from the community that facilitates automatic
 configuration creation. It is not part of the Unbound installation.
