Description:
 Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC image
 decoding process of the SPICE remote display system, before spice-0.14.2-1.
 Both the SPICE client (spice-gtk) and server are affected by these flaws.
 These flaws allow a malicious client or server to send specially crafted
 messages that, when processed by the QUIC image compression algorithm,
 result in a process crash or potential code execution.
