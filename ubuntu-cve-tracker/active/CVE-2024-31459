Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
 Prior to version 1.2.27, there is a file inclusion issue in the
 `lib/plugin.php` file. Combined with SQL injection vulnerabilities, remote
 code execution can be implemented. There is a file inclusion issue with the
 `api_plugin_hook()` function in the `lib/plugin.php` file, which reads the
 plugin_hooks and plugin_config tables in database. The read data is
 directly used to concatenate the file path which is used for file
 inclusion. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.
