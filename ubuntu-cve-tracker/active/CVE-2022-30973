Description:
 We failed to apply the fix for CVE-2022-30126 to the 1.x branch in the
 1.28.2 release. In Apache Tika, a regular expression in the StandardsText
 class, used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial
 of service caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only
 affects users who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which
 is a non-standard handler. This is fixed in 1.28.3.
