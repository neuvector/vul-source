Description:
 urllib3 is an HTTP client library for Python. urllib3's streaming API is
 designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the
 content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory
 at once. urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP
 `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). When
 using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes,
 enabling partial content consumption. Starting in version 1.22 and prior to
 version 2.6.3, for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the
 entire response body to drain the connection and decompress the content
 unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods
 were called, and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of
 decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard against
 decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this to trigger
 excessive resource consumption on the client. Applications and libraries
 are affected when they stream content from untrusted sources by setting
 `preload_content=False` when they do not disable redirects. Users should
 upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.3, in which the library does not decode
 content of redirect responses when `preload_content=False`. If upgrading is
 not immediately possible, disable redirects by setting `redirect=False` for
 requests to untrusted source.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3 binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-urllib3 is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
