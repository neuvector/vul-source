Description:
 A flaw was found in GIMP. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the
 GIMP "Despeckle"  plug-in. The issue occurs due to unchecked multiplication
 of image dimensions, such as width, height, and bytes-per-pixel (img_bpp),
 which can result in allocating insufficient memory and subsequently
 performing out-of-bounds writes. This issue could lead to heap corruption,
 a potential denial of service (DoS), or arbitrary code execution in certain
 scenarios.
