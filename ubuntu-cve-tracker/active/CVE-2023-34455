Description:
 snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to use of an
 unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions
 prior to 1.1.10.1.
 
 The code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java
 checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by
 attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn’t possible to read the 4 bytes, the
 function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code
 treats them as the length of the next chunk.
 
 In the case that the `compressed` variable is null, a byte array is
 allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn’t
 test the legality of the `chunkSize` variable, it is possible to pass a
 negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code
 to raise a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case
 would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which
 would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.
 
 Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.
