Description:
 A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the coap_delete_pdu_lkd function
 within coap_pdu.c of the libcoap library. This issue occurs due to improper
 handling of memory after the freeing of a PDU object, leading to potential
 memory corruption or the possibility of executing arbitrary code. NOTE:
 this is disputed by the Supplier because it only occurs when an application
 uses libcoap incorrectly.
