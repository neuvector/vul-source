Description:
 Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted
 access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages
 remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant
 table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches
 (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor
 enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of
 such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to
 retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other
 purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar
 issue was not noticed.
