Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. The fix applied for CVE-2023-39515 in version 1.2.25 is
 incomplete as it enables an adversary to have a victim browser execute
 malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over the malicious
 data source path in `data_debug.php`. To perform the cross-site scripting
 attack, the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the
 following permissions: `General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data`. The
 victim of this attack could be any account with permissions to view
 `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_debug.php`. As of time of publication, no
 complete fix has been included in Cacti.
