Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.x before 3.6.1. With TLS 1.3, when a
 server enables optional authentication of the client, if the
 client-provided certificate does not have appropriate values in if keyUsage
 or extKeyUsage extensions, then the return value of
 mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly have the
 MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE and MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE bits
 clear. As a result, an attacker that had a certificate valid for uses other
 than TLS client authentication would nonetheless be able to use it for TLS
 client authentication. Only TLS 1.3 servers were affected, and only with
 optional authentication (with required authentication, the handshake would
 be aborted with a fatal alert).
