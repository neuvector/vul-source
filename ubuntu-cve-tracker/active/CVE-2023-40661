Description:
 Several memory vulnerabilities were identified within the OpenSC packages,
 particularly in the card enrollment process using pkcs15-init when a user
 or administrator enrolls cards. To take advantage of these flaws, an
 attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a
 custom-crafted USB device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs.
 This manipulation can potentially allow compromise key generation,
 certificate loading, and other card management operations during
 enrollment.
