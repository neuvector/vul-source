Description:
 A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before
 2.0.0. RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients are
 supposed to verify. Assuming everything else is correct, the most recent
 version of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions, to prevent
 replays, accidental or otherwise. Manifests contain the manifestNumber and
 thisUpdate fields, which can be used to gauge the relevance of a given
 manifest, when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-like
 sequential number, and the latter is the date on which the manifest was
 created. However, the product does not compare the up-to-dateness of the
 most recently fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such, it's
 prone to a rollback to a previous version if it's served a valid outdated
 manifest. This leads to outdated route origin validation.
