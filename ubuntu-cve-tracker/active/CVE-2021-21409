Description:
 Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
 framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol
 servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version
 4.1.61.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. The
 content-length header is not correctly validated if the request only uses a
 single Http2HeaderFrame with the endStream set to to true. This could lead
 to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer and
 translated to HTTP/1.1. This is a followup of
 GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to fix this one case.
 This was fixed as part of 4.1.61.Final.
