Description:
 A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the BMPv3 Palette Decoding
 functionality of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When loading a
 specially crafted .bmp file, an integer overflow can be made to occur which
 will cause a heap-based buffer to overflow when reading the palette from
 the image. These conditions can allow for remote code execution. An
 attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this
 vulnerability.
