Description:
 Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and
 earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that
 are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly
 reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code
 disclosure.
 
 Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as
 the first segment of the substitution are affected.  Some unsafe
 RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag
 "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the
 substitution is appropriately constrained.
