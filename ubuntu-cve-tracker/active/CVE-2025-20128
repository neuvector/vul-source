Description:
 A vulnerability in the Object Linking and Embedding 2 (OLE2) decryption
 routine of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
 a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
 
 This vulnerability is due to an integer underflow in a bounds check that
 allows for a heap buffer overflow read. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be
 scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
 the attacker to terminate the ClamAV scanning process, resulting in a DoS
 condition on the affected software.
 For a description of this vulnerability, see the .
 Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There
 are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
