 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27927
Description:
 In Zabbix from 4.0.x before 4.0.28rc1, 5.0.0alpha1 before 5.0.10rc1, 5.2.x
 before 5.2.6rc1, and 5.4.0alpha1 before 5.4.0beta2, the
 CControllerAuthenticationUpdate controller lacks a CSRF protection
 mechanism. The code inside this controller calls diableSIDValidation inside
 the init() method. An attacker doesn't have to know Zabbix user login
 credentials, but has to know the correct Zabbix URL and contact information
 of an existing user with sufficient privileges.
