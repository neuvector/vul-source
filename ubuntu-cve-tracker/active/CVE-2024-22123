Description:
 Setting SMS media allows to set GSM modem file. Later this file is used as
 Linux device. But due everything is a file for Linux, it is possible to set
 another file, e.g. log file and zabbix_server will try to communicate with
 it as modem. As a result, log file will be broken with AT commands and
 small part for log file content will be leaked to UI.
