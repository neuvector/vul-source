Description:
 jsoup is a Java library for working with HTML. Those using jsoup versions
 prior to 1.14.2 to parse untrusted HTML or XML may be vulnerable to DOS
 attacks. If the parser is run on user supplied input, an attacker may
 supply content that causes the parser to get stuck (loop indefinitely until
 cancelled), to complete more slowly than usual, or to throw an unexpected
 exception. This effect may support a denial of service attack. The issue is
 patched in version 1.14.2. There are a few available workarounds. Users may
 rate limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on system
 resources, and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse
 runtimes.
