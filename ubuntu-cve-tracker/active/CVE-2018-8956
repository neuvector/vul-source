Description:
 ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p10, 4.2.8p11, 4.2.8p12 and 4.2.8p13 allow remote
 attackers to prevent a broadcast client from synchronizing its clock with a
 broadcast NTP server via soofed mode 3 and mode 5 packets. The attacker
 must either be a part of the same broadcast network or control a slave in
 that broadcast network that can capture certain required packets on the
 attacker's behalf and send them to the attacker.
