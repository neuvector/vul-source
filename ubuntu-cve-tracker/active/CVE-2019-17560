Description:
 The "Apache NetBeans" autoupdate system does not validate SSL certificates
 and hostnames for https based downloads. This allows an attacker to
 intercept downloads of autoupdates and modify the download, potentially
 injecting malicious code. “Apache NetBeans" versions up to and including
 11.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

 seth-arnold> Ubuntu users probably do not have privileges for this to work.
  Typically applications are updated via apt update or snap refresh. This
