Description:
 The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from a
 Nextcloud Server with your computer. Versions prior to 3.6.3 are missing
 sanitisation on qml labels which are used for basic HTML elements such as
 `strong`, `em` and `head` lines in the UI of the desktop client. The lack
 of sanitisation may allow for javascript injection. It is recommended that
 the Nextcloud Desktop Client is upgraded to 3.6.3. There are no known
 workarounds for this issue.
