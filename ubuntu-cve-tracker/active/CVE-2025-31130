Description:
 gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust. Before 0.42.0,
 gitoxide uses SHA-1 hash implementations without any collision detection,
 leaving it vulnerable to hash collision attacks. gitoxide uses the
 sha1_smol or sha1 crate, both of which implement standard SHA-1 without any
 mitigations for collision attacks. This means that two distinct Git objects
 with colliding SHA-1 hashes would break the Git object model and integrity
 checks when used with gitoxide. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.42.0.
