Description:
 Nextcloud Desktop is the desktop sync client for Nextcloud. Prior to
 3.16.5, when trying to manually lock a file inside an end-to-end encrypted
 directory, the path of the file was sent to the server unencrypted, making
 it possible for administrators to see it in log files. This vulnerability
 is fixed in 3.16.5.
