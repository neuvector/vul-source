Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
 Matrix.org Foundation. A malicious user on a Synapse homeserver X with
 permission to create certain state events can disable outbound federation
 from X to an arbitrary homeserver Y. Synapse instances with federation
 disabled are not affected. In versions of Synapse up to and including 1.73,
 Synapse did not limit the size of `invite_room_state`, meaning that it was
 possible to create an arbitrarily large invite event. Synapse 1.74 refuses
 to create oversized `invite_room_state` fields. Server operators should
 upgrade to Synapse 1.74 or newer urgently.
