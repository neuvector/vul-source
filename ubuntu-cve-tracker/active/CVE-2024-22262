Description:
 Applications that use UriComponentsBuilder to parse an externally provided
 URL (e.g. through a query parameter) AND perform validation checks on the
 host of the parsed URL may be vulnerable to a open redirect
 https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html attack or to a SSRF attack
 if the URL is used after passing validation checks. This is the same as
 CVE-2024-22259 https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-22259 and CVE-2024-22243
 https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-22243 , but with different input.
