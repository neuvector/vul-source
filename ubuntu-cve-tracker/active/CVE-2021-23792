Description:
 The package com.twelvemonkeys.imageio:imageio-metadata before 3.7.1 are
 vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection due to an insecurely
 initialized XML parser for reading XMP Metadata. An attacker can exploit
 this vulnerability if they are able to supply a file (e.g. when an online
 profile picture is processed) with a malicious XMP segment. If the XMP
 metadata of the uploaded image is parsed, then the XXE vulnerability is
 triggered.
