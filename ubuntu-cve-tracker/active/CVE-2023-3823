Description:
 In PHP versions 8.0.* before 8.0.30, 8.1.* before 8.1.22, and 8.2.* before
 8.2.8 various XML functions rely on libxml global state to track
 configuration variables, like whether external entities are loaded. This
 state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly changes it by
 calling appropriate function. However, since the state is process-global,
 other modules - such asÂ ImageMagick - may also use this library within the
 same process, and change that global state for their internal purposes, and
 leave it in a state where external entities loading is enabled. This can
 lead to the situation where external XML is parsed with external entities
 loaded, which can lead to disclosure of any local files accessible to PHP.
 This vulnerable state may persist in the same process across many requests,
 until the process is shut down.
