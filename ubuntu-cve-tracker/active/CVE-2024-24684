Description:
 Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the readOFF
 functionality of libigl v2.5.0. A specially crafted .off file can lead to
 stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can provide a malicious file to
 trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability concerns the header parsing
 occuring while processing an `.off` file via the `readOFF` function. We can
 see above that at [0] a stack-based buffer called `comment` is defined with
 an hardcoded size of `1000 bytes`. The call to `fscanf` at [1] is unsafe
 and if the first line of the header of the `.off` files is longer than 1000
 bytes it will overflow the `header` buffer.
