Description:
 Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. The
 `title` parameter is not properly sanitized when saving external links in
 links.php . Morever, the said title parameter is stored in the database and
 reflected back to user in index.php, finally leading to stored XSS. Users
 with the privilege to create external links can manipulate the `title`
 parameter in the http post request while creating external links to perform
 stored XSS attacks. The vulnerability known as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
 occurs when an application allows untrusted user input to be displayed on a
 web page without proper validation or escaping. This issue has been
 addressed in release version 1.2.28. All users are advised to upgrade.
 There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
