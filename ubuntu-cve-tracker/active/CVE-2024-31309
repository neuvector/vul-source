Description:
 HTTP/2 CONTINUATION DoS attack can cause Apache Traffic Server to consume
 more resources on the server. Version from 8.0.0 through 8.1.9, from 9.0.0
 through 9.2.3 are affected. Users can set a new setting
 (proxy.config.http2.max_continuation_frames_per_minute) to limit the number
 of CONTINUATION frames per minute. ATS does have a fixed amount of memory a
 request can use and ATS adheres to these limits in previous releases. Users
 are recommended to upgrade to versions 8.1.10 or 9.2.4 which fixes the
 issue.
