Description:
 In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.38.v20210224, the default
 compliance mode allows requests with URIs that contain %2e or %2e%2e
 segments to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. For
 example a request to /context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml can retrieve the web.xml
 file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of
 a web application.
