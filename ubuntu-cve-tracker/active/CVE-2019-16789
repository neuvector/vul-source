Description:
 In Waitress through version 1.4.0, if a proxy server is used in front of
 waitress, an invalid request may be sent by an attacker that bypasses the
 front-end and is parsed differently by waitress leading to a potential for
 HTTP request smuggling. Specially crafted requests containing special
 whitespace characters in the Transfer-Encoding header would get parsed by
 Waitress as being a chunked request, but a front-end server would use the
 Content-Length instead as the Transfer-Encoding header is considered
 invalid due to containing invalid characters. If a front-end server does
 HTTP pipelining to a backend Waitress server this could lead to HTTP
 request splitting which may lead to potential cache poisoning or unexpected
 information disclosure. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.1 through more
 strict HTTP field validation.
