Description:
 WordPress through 6.1.1 depends on unpredictable client visits to cause
 wp-cron.php execution and the resulting security updates, and the source
 code describes "the scenario where a site may not receive enough visits to
 execute scheduled tasks in a timely manner," but neither the installation
 guide nor the security guide mentions this default behavior, or alerts the
 user about security risks on installations with very few visits.
