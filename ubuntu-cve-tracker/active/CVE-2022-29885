Description:
 The documentation of Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M14, 10.0.0-M1 to
 10.0.20, 9.0.13 to 9.0.62 and 8.5.38 to 8.5.78 for the EncryptInterceptor
 incorrectly stated it enabled Tomcat clustering to run over an untrusted
 network. This was not correct. While the EncryptInterceptor does provide
 confidentiality and integrity protection, it does not protect against all
 risks associated with running over any untrusted network, particularly DoS
 risks.
