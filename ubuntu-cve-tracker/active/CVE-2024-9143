Description:
 Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with
 untrusted
 explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory
 reads
 or writes.
 
 Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash
 or
 even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the
 protocols
 involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only
 "named
 curves" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
 specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
 problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
 application is low.
 
 In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509
 certificates,
 so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
 certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an "exotic"
 curve encoding.
 
 The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(),
 EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
 and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.
 
 Applications working with "exotic" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve
 parameters,
 that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
 constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
 result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code
 execution
 cannot easily be ruled out.
 
 The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
