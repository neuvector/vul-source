Description:
 Symfony/Http-Kernel is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHP
 framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP
 components. Headers that are not part of the "trusted_headers" allowed list
 are ignored and protect users from "Cache poisoning" attacks. In Symfony
 5.2, maintainers added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` headers, but
 this header was accessible in SubRequest, even if it was not part of the
 "trusted_headers" allowed list. An attacker could leverage this opportunity
 to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, leading to a
 web cache poisoning issue. Versions 5.3.12 and later have a patch to ensure
 that the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is not forwarded to subrequests when
 it is not trusted.
