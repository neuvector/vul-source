Description:
 A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in
 the heap area. An attacker may take advantage of that to cause heap data
 corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent secure
 boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an
 attacker needs to perform some triage over the heap layout to achieve
 signifcant results, also the values written into the memory are repeated
 three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw
 affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.
