Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions
 8.2.1 and below allow an authenticated user to use a specially crafted Lua
 script to manipulate different LUA objects and potentially run their own
 code in the context of another user. The problem exists in all versions of
 Redis with LUA scripting. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.2. A
 workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server
 executable is to prevent users from executing LUA scripts. This can be done
 using ACL to block a script by restricting both the EVAL and FUNCTION
 command families.
