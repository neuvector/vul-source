Description:
 An integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was
 discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way packets are read from the
 server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to
 execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that libssh2 mishandled certain input. If libssh2 were used
 to connect to a malicious or compromised SSH server, a remote, unauthenticated
 attacker could execute arbitrary code on the client system.
