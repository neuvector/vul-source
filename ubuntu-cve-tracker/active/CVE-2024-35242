Description:
 Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. On the 2.x branch prior to
 versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7, the `composer install` command running inside a
 git/hg repository which has specially crafted branch names can lead to
 command injection. This requires cloning untrusted repositories. Patches
 are available in version 2.2.24 for 2.2 LTS or 2.7.7 for mainline. As a
 workaround, avoid cloning potentially compromised repositories.
