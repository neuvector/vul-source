Description:
 The researcher is showing that due to the way the SNMP trap log is parsed,
 an attacker can craft an SNMP trap with additional lines of information and
 have forged data show in the Zabbix UI. This attack requires SNMP auth to
 be off and/or the attacker to know the community/auth details. The attack
 requires an SNMP item to be configured as text on the target host.
