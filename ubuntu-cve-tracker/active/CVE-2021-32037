Description:
 An authorized user may trigger an invariant which may result in denial of
 service or server exit if a relevant aggregation request is sent to a
 shard. Usually, the requests are sent via mongos and special privileges are
 required in order to know the address of the shards and to log in to the
 shards of an auth enabled environment.
