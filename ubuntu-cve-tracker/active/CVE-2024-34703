Description:
 Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify
 elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit
 encoding of the parameters. Prior to versions 3.3.0 and 2.19.4, an attacker
 could present an ECDSA X.509 certificate using explicit encoding where the
 parameters are very large. The proof of concept used a 16Kbit prime for
 this purpose. When parsing, the parameter is checked to be prime, causing
 excessive computation. This was patched in 2.19.4 and 3.3.0 to allow the
 prime parameter of the elliptic curve to be at most 521 bits. No known
 workarounds are available. Note that support for explicit encoding of
 elliptic curve parameters is deprecated in Botan.
