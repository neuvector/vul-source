Description:
 Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework, and
 command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables are
 exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2.
 Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on configuration objects
 in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to reference secrets in other
 configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a
 service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to
 logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect
 the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection
 rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***`
 being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists
 will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI,
 custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented
 URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2
 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter
 is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV. Protection rules and
 blacklists however have no effect in this case. Custom variables are shown
 as-is in the result. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and
 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one may set up a restriction to hide hosts
 and services with the custom variable in question.
