Description:
 wkhtmlTOpdf 0.12.6 is vulnerable to SSRF which allows an attacker to get
 initial access into the target's system by injecting iframe tag with
 initial asset IP address on it's source. This allows the attacker to
 takeover the whole infrastructure by accessing their internal assets.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> as of 2023-07-18, no fix for this vulnerability was made available by
 ccdm94> upstream. That is because this is not being considered a wkhtmltopdf issue,
 ccdm94> but instead an issue with applications using wktohtmlpdf without first
 ccdm94> sanitizing input that is user-supplied HTML/JS. In the related GitHub
 ccdm94> issue page it is possible to see that this issue is possibly being disputed.
 ccdm94> Commit 5426e55 was presented by maintainers as the commit that highlights
 ccdm94> the fact that they are aware of this behavior, and consider it to be
 ccdm94> expected.
