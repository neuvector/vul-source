Description:
 OctoRPKI does not limit the length of a connection, allowing for a
 slowloris DOS attack to take place which makes OctoRPKI wait forever.
 Specifically, the repository that OctoRPKI sends HTTP requests to will keep
 the connection open for a day before a response is returned, but does keep
 drip feeding new bytes to keep the connection alive.
