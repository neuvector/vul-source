Description:
 JRuby-OpenSSL is an add-on gem for JRuby that emulates the Ruby OpenSSL
 native library. Starting in JRuby-OpenSSL version 0.12.1 and prior to
 version 0.15.4 (corresponding to JRuby versions starting in 9.3.4.0 prior
 to 9.4.12.1 and 10.0.0.0 prior to 10.0.0.1), when verifying SSL
 certificates, JRuby-OpenSSL does not verify that the hostname presented in
 the certificate matches the one the user tries to connect to. This means a
 man-in-the-middle could just present any valid cert for a completely
 different domain they own, and JRuby would accept the cert. Anybody using
 JRuby to make requests of external APIs, or scraping the web, that depends
 on https to connect securely. JRuby-OpenSSL version 0.15.4 contains a fix
 for the issue. This fix is included in JRuby versions 10.0.0.1 and
 9.4.12.1.
