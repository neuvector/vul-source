Description:
 tif_getimage.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10, as used in GDAL through 3.0.1 and
 other products, has an integer overflow that potentially causes a
 heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted RGBA image, related to a
 "Negative-size-param" condition.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that GDAL incorrectly handled certain malformed images.
 If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially
 crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a
 denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
Notes:
 sbeattie> the neuron package dropped the embedded InterView library
   (which contained an embedded libtiff) in 8.2.2-1.
