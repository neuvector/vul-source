Description:
 This repository hosts source code implementing the Trusted Computing
 Group's (TCG) TPM2 Software Stack (TSS). The JSON Quote Info returned by
 Fapi_Quote has to be deserialized by Fapi_VerifyQuote to the TPM Structure
 `TPMS_ATTEST`. For the field `TPM2_GENERATED magic` of this structure any
 number can be used in the JSON structure. The verifier can receive a state
 which does not represent the actual, possibly malicious state of the device
 under test. The malicious device might get access to data it shouldn't, or
 can use services it shouldn't be able to. This
 issue has been patched in version 4.1.0.
