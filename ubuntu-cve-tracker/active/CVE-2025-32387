Description:
 Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. A JSON Schema file
 within a chart can be crafted with a deeply nested chain of references,
 leading to parser recursion that can exceed the stack size limit and
 trigger a stack overflow. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.17.3.
