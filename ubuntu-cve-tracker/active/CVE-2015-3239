Description:
 Off-by-one error in the dwarf_to_unw_regnum function in include/dwarf_i.h
 in libunwind 1.1 allows local users to have unspecified impact via invalid
 dwarf opcodes.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> I saw nothing in callers of this macro that would prevent
  less-than-zero accesses: input params were sometimes integers, sometimes
  harder to determine the type. Debian codesearch shows many duplications of
  the <= mistake with dwarf_to_unw_regnum arrays in other files, not just the
  one dwarf_i.h.
 mdeslaur> We do not support security updates for Android components,
 mdeslaur> marking as ignored.
