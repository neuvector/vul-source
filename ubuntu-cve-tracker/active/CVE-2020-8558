Description:
 The Kubelet and kube-proxy components in versions 1.1.0-1.16.10,
 1.17.0-1.17.6, and 1.18.0-1.18.3 were found to contain a security issue
 which allows adjacent hosts to reach TCP and UDP services bound to
 127.0.0.1 running on the node or in the node's network namespace. Such a
 service is generally thought to be reachable only by other processes on the
 same host, but due to this defeect, could be reachable by other hosts on
 the same LAN as the node, or by containers running on the same node as the
 service.
