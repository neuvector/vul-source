Description:
 nscd: Stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cache If the Name Service
 Cache Daemon's (nscd) fixed size cache is exhausted by client requests then
 a subsequent client request for netgroup data may result in a stack-based
 buffer overflow. This flaw was introduced in glibc 2.15 when the cache was
 added to nscd. This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.
