Description:
 OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x allows attacks that inject authentication
 results to provide false information about the domain that originated an
 e-mail message. This is caused by incorrect parsing and interpretation of
 SPF/DKIM authentication results, as demonstrated by the
 example.net(.example.com substring.
