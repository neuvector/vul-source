Description:
 The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and
 REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter notebook,
 JupyterLab, and Voila. Unhandled errors in API requests coming from an
 authenticated user include traceback information, which can include path
 information. There is no known mechanism by which to trigger these errors
 without authentication, so the paths revealed are not considered
 particularly sensitive, given that the requesting user has arbitrary
 execution permissions already in the same environment. A fix has been
 introduced in commit `0056c3aa52` which no longer includes traceback
 information in JSON error responses. For compatibility, the traceback field
 is present, but always empty. This commit has been included in version
 2.11.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
 this vulnerability.
