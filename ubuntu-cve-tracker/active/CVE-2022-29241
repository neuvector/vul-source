Description:
 Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST
 endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter Notebook. Prior to
 version 1.17.1, if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir`
 that contains the starting user's home directory, then the underlying REST
 API can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time by
 guessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requires
 an authenticated user session, this URL can be used from a cross-site
 scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leak
 this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along
 with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as
 modifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or
 .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read potentially
 sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issue
 is patched in version 1.17.1.
