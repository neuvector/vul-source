Description:
 In Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 - 5.3.18, 5.2.0 - 5.2.20, and older
 unsupported versions, the patterns for disallowedFields on a DataBinder are
 case sensitive which means a field is not effectively protected unless it
 is listed with both upper and lower case for the first character of the
 field, including upper and lower case for the first character of all nested
 fields within the property path.
