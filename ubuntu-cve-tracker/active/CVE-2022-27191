Description:
 The golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package before
 0.0.0-20220314234659-1baeb1ce4c0b for Go allows an attacker to crash a
 server in certain circumstances involving AddHostKey.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> snapd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto
 jdstrand> lxd in 18.04 LTS and earlier contains an embedded copy of
  golang-go.crypto
 mdeslaur> snapd and lxd only use the terminal sub-package, not the ssh
 mdeslaur> part of golang-go.crypto, so they are not vulnerable
