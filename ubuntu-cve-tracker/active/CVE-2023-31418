Description:
 An issue has been identified with how Elasticsearch handled incoming
 requests on the HTTP layer. An unauthenticated user could force an
 Elasticsearch node to exit with an OutOfMemory error by sending a moderate
 number of malformed HTTP requests. The issue was identified by Elastic
 Engineering and we have no indication that the issue is known or that it is
 being exploited in the wild.
