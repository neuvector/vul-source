Description:
 Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted
 framework. A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the
 `url_preview_url_blacklist` setting potentially allowing server side
 request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP
 addresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` setting (by
 default this only allows public IPs) and by the limited information
 returned to the client: 1. For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSON
 response or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is
 discarded. 2. For discovered image URLs, any non-image response is
 discarded. Systems which have URL preview disabled (via the
 `url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a
 `url_preview_url_blacklist` are not affected. This issue has been addressed
 in version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade. User unable to upgrade may
 also disable URL previews.
