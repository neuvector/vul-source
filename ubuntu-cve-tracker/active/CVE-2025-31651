Description:
 Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences vulnerability
 in Apache Tomcat.Â For a subset of unlikely rewrite rule configurations, it
 was possible
 for a specially crafted request to bypass some rewrite rules. If those
 rewrite rules effectively enforced security constraints, those
 constraints could be bypassed.
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.5, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.39, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.102.
 The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are
 known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions
 may also be affected.
 
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version [FIXED_VERSION], which fixes
 the issue.
