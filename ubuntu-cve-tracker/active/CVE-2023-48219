Description:
 TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting
 (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s core undo/redo
 functionality and other APIs and plugins. Text nodes within specific
 parents are not escaped upon serialization according to the HTML standard.
 If such text nodes contain a special character reserved as an internal
 marker, they can be combined with other HTML patterns to form malicious
 snippets. These snippets pass the initial sanitisation layer when the
 content is parsed into the editor body, but can trigger XSS when the
 special internal marker is removed from the content and re-parsed. his
 vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE versions 6.7.3 and 5.10.9. Users
 are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
