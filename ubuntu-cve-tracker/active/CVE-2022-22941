Description:
 An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt in versions before 3002.8,
 3003.4, 3004.1. When configured as a Master-of-Masters, with a
 publisher_acl, if a user configured in the publisher_acl targets any minion
 connected to the Syndic, the Salt Master incorrectly interpreted no valid
 targets as valid, allowing configured users to target any of the minions
 connected to the syndic with their configured commands. This requires a
 syndic master combined with publisher_acl configured on the
 Master-of-Masters, allowing users specified in the publisher_acl to bypass
 permissions, publishing authorized commands to any configured minion.
