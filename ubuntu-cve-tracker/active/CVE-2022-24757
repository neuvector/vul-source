Description:
 The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and
 REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications. Prior to version 1.15.4,
 unauthorized actors can access sensitive information from server logs.
 Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values
 are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do
 not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal
 sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server.
 Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are
 currently no known workarounds.
