 https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/pull/1168/commits/c277159986c80142180fbe5efb256bbf3bdf3edc
Description:
 Out-of-bounds accesses in the functions pi_next_lrcp, pi_next_rlcp,
 pi_next_rpcl, pi_next_pcrl, pi_next_rpcl, and pi_next_cprl in openmj2/pi.c
 in OpenJPEG through 2.3.0 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> Marking emscripten ignored as openjpeg2 code is only for test/example.
 emitorino> Debian binary packages built with BUILD_MJ2:BOOL=OFF
 emitorino> According to https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/pull/1168#commitcomment-32961642 the patch https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/commit/e1740e7ce79d0a1676db4da0f4189b64e85f52cb was reverted because it did not compile. Code is not present in upstream master anymore
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu packages are built with BUILD_MJ2:BOOL=OFF, so the
 mdeslaur> affected code isn't compiled
 ccdm94> according to the comments available in issue 1328 of openjpeg
 ccdm94> (https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues/1328), this issue
 ccdm94> will not be fixed by upstream, as the vulnerable components
 ccdm94> were simply removed from the code in pull request #1350. For
 ccdm94> this reason, xenial and trusty cannot be patched for this issue
 ccdm94> in package openjpeg. There was a patch available, which was commit
 ccdm94> c277159986c, however, it did not compile, and therefore was 
 ccdm94> reverted by upstream. No new fixes for this issue were made
 ccdm94> available, the solution apparently being the removal of the code
 ccdm94> that contains the vulnerability.
