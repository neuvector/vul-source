Description:
 Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior
 to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can
 construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such
 messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may
 be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdk
 implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end.
 Starting with version 19.7.0, the default policy for accepting key forwards
 has been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now only
 accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only
 from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the
 decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt
 the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that
 messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated
 appropriately, for example, by showing a warning for such messages. This
 attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an
 attacker, and those who trust your homeservers do not need a workaround.
