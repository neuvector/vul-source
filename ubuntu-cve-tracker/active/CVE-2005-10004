Description:
 Cacti versions prior to 0.8.6-d contain a remote command execution
 vulnerability in the graph_view.php script. An authenticated user can
 inject arbitrary shell commands via the graph_start GET parameter, which is
 improperly handled during graph rendering. This flaw allows attackers to
 execute commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of
 the web server process, potentially compromising system integrity.
