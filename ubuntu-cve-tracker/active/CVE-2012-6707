Description:
 WordPress through 4.8.2 uses a weak MD5-based password hashing algorithm,
 which makes it easier for attackers to determine cleartext values by
 leveraging access to the hash values. NOTE: the approach to changing this
 may not be fully compatible with certain use cases, such as migration of a
 WordPress site from a web host that uses a recent PHP version to a
 different web host that uses PHP 5.2. These use cases are plausible (but
 very unlikely) based on statistics showing widespread deployment of
 WordPress with obsolete PHP versions.
