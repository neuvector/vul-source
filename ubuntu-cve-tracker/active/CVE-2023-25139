Description:
 sprintf in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.37 has a buffer overflow
 (out-of-bounds write) in some situations with a correct buffer size. This
 is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination
 buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string
 representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size
 required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with
 padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.
