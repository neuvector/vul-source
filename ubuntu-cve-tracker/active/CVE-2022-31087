Description:
 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g.
 users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions
 prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows
 interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files. An attacker
 capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a web-shell
 into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has
 been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow
 executing PHP scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory.
