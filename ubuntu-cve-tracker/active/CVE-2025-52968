Description:
 xdg-open in xdg-utils through 1.2.1 can send requests containing
 SameSite=Strict cookies, which can facilitate CSRF. (For example, xdg-open
 could be modified to, by default, associate x-scheme-handler/https with the
 execution of a browser with command-line options that arrange for an empty
 cookie store, although this would add substantial complexity, and would not
 be considered a desirable or expected behavior by all users.) NOTE: this is
 disputed because integrations of xdg-open typically do not provide
 information about whether the xdg-open command and arguments were manually
 entered by a user, or whether they were the result of a navigation from
 content in an untrusted origin.
