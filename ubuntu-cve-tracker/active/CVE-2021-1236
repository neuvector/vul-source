Description:
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
 application detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote
 attacker to bypass the configured policies on an affected system. The
 vulnerability is due to a flaw in the detection algorithm. An attacker
 could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets that would flow
 through an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
 to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the
 protected network.
