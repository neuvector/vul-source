Description:
 `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In
 `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and
 apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to
 execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside
 the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that
 use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a
 leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a
 Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such
 as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g.
 the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before
 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an
 array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the
 possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore
 treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead
 to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be
 leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the
 `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To
 exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing
 a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git
 repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of
 `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but
 will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs
 to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that
 evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability
 can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the
 takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it
 requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem
 by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those
 Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users
 can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before
 running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain
 arbitrary ruby code.
