Description:
 In nbd-server in nbd before 3.24, there is an integer overflow with a
 resultant heap-based buffer overflow. A value of 0xffffffff in the name
 length field will cause a zero-sized buffer to be allocated for the name,
 resulting in a write to a dangling pointer. This issue exists for the
 NBD_OPT_INFO, NBD_OPT_GO, and NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME messages.
