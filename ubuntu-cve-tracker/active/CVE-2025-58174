Description:
 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored in
 an LDAP directory. LAM before 9.3 allows stored cross-site scripting in the
 Profile section via the profile name field, which renders untrusted input
 as HTML and executes a supplied script (for example a script element). An
 authenticated user with permission to create or edit a profile can insert a
 script payload into the profile name and have it executed when the profile
 data is viewed in a browser. This issue is fixed in version 9.3. No known
 workarounds are mentioned.
