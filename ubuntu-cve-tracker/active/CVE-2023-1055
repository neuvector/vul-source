Description:
 A flaw was found in RHDS 11 and RHDS 12. While browsing entries LDAP tries
 to decode the userPassword attribute instead of the userCertificate
 attribute which could lead into sensitive information leaked. An attacker
 with a local account where the cockpit-389-ds is running can list the
 processes and display the hashed passwords. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
