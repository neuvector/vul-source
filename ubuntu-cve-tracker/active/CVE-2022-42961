Description:
 An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. A fault injection attack
 on RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users performing
 signing operations with private ECC keys, such as in server-side TLS
 connections, might leak faulty ECC signatures. These signatures can be
 processed via an advanced technique for ECDSA key recovery. (In 5.5.0 and
 later, WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS can be used to address the vulnerability.)
