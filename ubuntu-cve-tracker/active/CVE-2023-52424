Description:
 The IEEE 802.11 standard sometimes enables an adversary to trick a victim
 into connecting to an unintended or untrusted network with Home WEP, Home
 WPA3 SAE-loop. Enterprise 802.1X/EAP, Mesh AMPE, or FILS, aka an "SSID
 Confusion" issue. This occurs because the SSID is not always used to derive
 the pairwise master key or session keys, and because there is not a
 protected exchange of an SSID during a 4-way handshake.

Notes:
 alexmurray> Since this is a vulnerability in the 802.11 standard it is
  assumed that the wpa package in Ubuntu (which is an implementation of this
  standard) is affected but at this time 2024-09-09 there does not appear to
  be an official update available from the project which resolves this
  vulnerability.
