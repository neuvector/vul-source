Description:
 stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis
 files. A crafted file may trigger memory allocation failure in
 `start_decoder`. In that case the function returns early, the
 `f->comment_list` is set to `NULL`, but `f->comment_list_length` is not
 reset. Later in `vorbis_deinit` it tries to dereference the `NULL` pointer.
 This issue may lead to denial of service.
