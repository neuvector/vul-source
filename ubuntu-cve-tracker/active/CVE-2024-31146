Description:
 When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed
 through to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective
 guests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing
 internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration
 cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far
 missing.
 
 Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but
 are not limited to
 - - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the
   same page (4k on x86),
 - - INTx lines.
