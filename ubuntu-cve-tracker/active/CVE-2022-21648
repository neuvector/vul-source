Description:
 Latte is an open source template engine for PHP. Versions since 2.8.0 Latte
 has included a template sandbox and in affected versions it has been found
 that a sandbox escape exists allowing for injection into web pages
 generated from Latte. This may lead to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in
 the versions 2.8.8, 2.9.6 and 2.10.8. Users unable to upgrade should not
 accept template input from untrusted sources.
