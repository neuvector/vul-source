Description:
 Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to
 another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. Starting in
 version 1.13 and prior to version 3.1.4, Pandoc is susceptible to an
 arbitrary file write vulnerability, which can be triggered by providing a
 specially crafted image element in the input when generating files using
 the `--extract-media` option or outputting to PDF format. This
 vulnerability allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files on
 the system ,depending on the privileges of the process running pandoc. It
 only affects systems that pass untrusted user input to pandoc and allow
 pandoc to be used to produce a PDF or with the `--extract-media` option.
 The fix is to unescape the percent-encoding prior to checking that the
 resource is not above the working directory, and prior to extracting the
 extension. Some code for checking that the path is below the working
 directory was flawed in a similar way and has also been fixed. Note that
 the `--sandbox` option, which only affects IO done by readers and writers
 themselves, does not block this vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched
 in pandoc 3.1.4. As a workaround, audit the pandoc command and disallow PDF
 output and the `--extract-media` option.
