Description:
 Substitution encoding issue in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and
 earlier allows attacker to execute scripts in
 directories permitted by the configuration but not directly reachable by
 any URL or source disclosure of scripts meant to only to be executed as
 CGI.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.
 
 Some RewriteRules that capture and substitute unsafely will now fail unless
 rewrite flag "UnsafeAllow3F" is specified.
