Description:
 Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in
 Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external
 dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In
 versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip
 that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the
 build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When
 signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains
 entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum`
 element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata
 contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no
 signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification
 will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not
 complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are
 vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary
 from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For
 those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the
 build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one.
 Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification
 if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two
 workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency
 verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid
 adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.
