Description:
 Within tcpreplay's tcprewrite, a double free vulnerability has been
 identified in the dlt_linuxsll2_cleanup() function in
 plugins/dlt_linuxsll2/linuxsll2.c. This vulnerability is triggered when
 tcpedit_dlt_cleanup() indirectly invokes the cleanup routine multiple times
 on the same memory region. By supplying a specifically crafted pcap file to
 the tcprewrite binary, a local attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a
 Denial of Service (DoS) via memory corruption.
