Description:
 OTP is a set of Erlang libraries, which consists of the Erlang runtime
 system, a number of ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang, and a
 set of design principles for Erlang programs. A regression was introduced
 into the ssl application of OTP starting at OTP-25.3.2.8, OTP-26.2, and
 OTP-27.0, resulting in a server or client verifying the peer when incorrect
 extended key usage is presented (i.e., a server will verify a client if
 they have server auth ext key usage and vice versa).
