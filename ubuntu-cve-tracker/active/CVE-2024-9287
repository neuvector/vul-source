Description:
 A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where
 path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted
 properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment
 "activation" scripts (ie "source venv/bin/activate"). This means that
 attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the
 virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not
 created by an attacker or which aren't activated before being used (ie
 "./venv/bin/python") are not affected.
