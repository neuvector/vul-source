Description:
 Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 did not handle
 multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could craft
 certificate subjects containing a single-value Relative Distinguished Name
 that would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for
 example, in order to inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the
 certificate subject verification.Affected versions of Node.js that do not
 accept multi-value Relative Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable
 to such attacks themselves. However, third-party code that uses node's
 ambiguous presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.
