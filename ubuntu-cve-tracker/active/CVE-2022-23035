Description:
 Insufficient cleanup of passed-through device IRQs The management of IRQs
 associated with physical devices exposed to x86 HVM guests involves an
 iterative operation in particular when cleaning up after the guest's use of
 the device. In the case where an interrupt is not quiescent yet at the time
 this cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup attempt may be scheduled to be
 retried. When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retry
 may get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared
 (resulting in a de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in a
 use-after-free), while other code would continue to assume them to be
 valid.
