Description:
 A flaw was found in dogtag-pki and pki-core. The token authentication
 scheme can be bypassed with a LDAP injection. By passing the query string
 parameter sessionID=*, an attacker can authenticate with an existing
 session saved in the LDAP directory server, which may lead to escalation of
 privilege.
