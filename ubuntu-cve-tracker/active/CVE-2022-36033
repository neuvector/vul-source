Description:
 jsoup is a Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning, scraping,
 and cross-site scripting (XSS) safety. jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML
 including `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow XSS attacks when
 a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default
 `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including
 `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not
 be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a
 Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This issue is
 patched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version.
 Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content
 should be cleaned again using the updated version. To remediate this issue
 without immediately upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`,
 which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate
 [Content Security
 Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined.
 (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best
 practice.)
