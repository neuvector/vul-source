Description:
 Within HostnameError.Error(), when constructing an error string, there is
 no limit to the number of hosts that will be printed out. Furthermore, the
 error string is constructed by repeated string concatenation, leading to
 quadratic runtime. Therefore, a certificate provided by a malicious actor
 can result in excessive resource consumption.
