Description:
 In Eclipse Mosquito, versions from 2.0.0 through 2.0.18, if a Mosquitto
 broker is configured to create an outgoing bridge connection, and that
 bridge connection has an incoming topic configured that makes use of topic
 remapping, then if the remote connection sends a crafted PUBLISH packet to
 the broker a double free will occur with a subsequent crash of the broker.
