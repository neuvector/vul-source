Description:
 x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where host
 assisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging
 (HAP) is unavailable, Xen will run guests in so called shadow mode. Shadow
 mode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page tables as well as
 auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests, Xen additionally
 runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by the
 log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to
 keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which
 may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that
 enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately,
 while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path
 requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the
 log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result,
 just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while
 other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain
 allocated.
