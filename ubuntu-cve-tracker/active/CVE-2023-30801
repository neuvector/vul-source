Description:
 All versions of the qBittorrent client through 4.5.5 use default
 credentials when the web user interface is enabled. The administrator is
 not forced to change the default credentials. As of 4.5.5, this issue has
 not been fixed. A remote attacker can use the default credentials to
 authenticate and execute arbitrary operating system commands using the
 "external program" feature in the web user interface. This was reportedly
 exploited in the wild in March 2023.
