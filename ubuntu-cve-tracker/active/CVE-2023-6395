Description:
 The Mock software contains a vulnerability wherein an attacker could
 potentially exploit privilege escalation, enabling the execution of
 arbitrary code with root user privileges. This weakness stems from the
 absence of proper sandboxing during the expansion and execution of Jinja2
 templates, which may be included in certain configuration parameters. While
 the Mock documentation advises treating users added to the mock group as
 privileged, certain build systems invoking mock on behalf of users might
 inadvertently permit less privileged users to define configuration tags.
 These tags could then be passed as parameters to mock during execution,
 potentially leading to the utilization of Jinja2 templates for remote
 privilege escalation and the execution of arbitrary code as the root user
 on the build server.
