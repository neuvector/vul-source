Description:
 corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 contains an improper regex path
 matching vulnerability. The plugin prioritizes longer regex patterns over
 more specific ones when matching paths, which can lead to less restrictive
 CORS policies being applied to sensitive endpoints. This mismatch in regex
 pattern priority allows unauthorized cross-origin access to sensitive data
 or functionality, potentially exposing confidential information and
 increasing the risk of unauthorized actions by malicious actors.
