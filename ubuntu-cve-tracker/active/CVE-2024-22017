Description:
 setuid() does not affect libuv's internal io_uring operations if
 initialized before the call to setuid(). This allows the process to perform
 privileged operations despite presumably having dropped such privileges
 through a call to setuid(). This vulnerability affects all users using
 version greater or equal than Node.js 18.18.0, Node.js 20.4.0 and Node.js
 21.
