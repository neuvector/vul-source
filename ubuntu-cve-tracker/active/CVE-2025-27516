Description:
 Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in
 how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows
 an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary
 Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the
 content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of
 application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications
 which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to
 str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's
 possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain
 format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no
 longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is
 fixed in 3.1.6.
