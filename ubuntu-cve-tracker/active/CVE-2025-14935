Description:
 NSF Unidata NetCDF-C Dimension Name Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NSF Unidata NetCDF-C.
 User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
 target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of dimension names. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
 data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker
 can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the
 current user. Was ZDI-CAN-27168.
