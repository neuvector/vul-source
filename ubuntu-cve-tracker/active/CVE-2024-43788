Description:
 Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files
 for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
 or packaging just about any resource or asset. The webpack developers have
 discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpackâ€™s
 `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can
 lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless
 attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized
 `name` attribute) are present. Real-world exploitation of this gadget has
 been observed in the Canvas LMS which allows a XSS attack to happen through
 a javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from
 Webpack). DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker
 first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the
 webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces
 of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into
 executable code. This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS)
 on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject
 certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id
 attributes. This issue has been addressed in release version 5.94.0. All
 users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 issue.
