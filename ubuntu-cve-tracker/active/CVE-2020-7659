Description:
 reel through 0.6.1 allows Request Smuggling attacks due to incorrect
 Content-Length and Transfer encoding header parsing. It is possible to
 conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header
 twice. Furthermore, invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be
 parsed as valid which could be leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks. Note:
 This project is deprecated, and is not maintained any more.
