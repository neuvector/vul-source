Description:
 pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version
 6.1.3, an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads
 to an infinite loop. This requires parsing the content stream of a page
 which has an inline image using the DCTDecode filter. This has been fixed
 in pypdf version 6.1.3.
