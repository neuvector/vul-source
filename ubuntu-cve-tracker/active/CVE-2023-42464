Description:
 A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC functions in
 afpd in Netatalk 3.1.x before 3.1.17. When parsing Spotlight RPC packets,
 one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys
 are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in
 the underlying protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the
 dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with a
 key, a malicious actor may be able to fully control the value of the
 pointer and theoretically achieve Remote Code Execution on the host. This
 issue is similar to CVE-2023-34967.
