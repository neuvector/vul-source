Description:
 lib/kadm5/kadm_rpc_xdr.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.20.2 and
 1.21.x before 1.21.1 frees an uninitialized pointer. A remote authenticated
 user can trigger a kadmind crash. This occurs because
 _xdr_kadm5_principal_ent_rec does not validate the relationship between
 n_key_data and the key_data array count.
