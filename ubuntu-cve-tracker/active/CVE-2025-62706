Description:
 Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers.
 Prior to version 1.6.5, Authlib’s JWE zip=DEF path performs unbounded
 DEFLATE decompression. A very small ciphertext can expand into tens or
 hundreds of megabytes on decrypt, allowing an attacker who can supply
 decryptable tokens to exhaust memory and CPU and cause denial of service.
 This issue has been patched in version 1.6.5. Workarounds for this issue
 involve rejecting or stripping zip=DEF for inbound JWEs at the application
 boundary, forking and add a bounded decompression guard via
 decompressobj().decompress(data, MAX_SIZE)) and returning an error when
 output exceeds a safe limit, or enforcing strict maximum token sizes and
 fail fast on oversized inputs; combine with rate limiting.
