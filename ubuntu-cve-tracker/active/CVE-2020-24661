Description:
 GNOME Geary before 3.36.3 mishandles pinned TLS certificate verification
 for IMAP and SMTP services using invalid TLS certificates (e.g.,
 self-signed certificates) when the client system is not configured to use a
 system-provided PKCS#11 store. This allows a meddler in the middle to
 present a different invalid certificate to intercept incoming and outgoing
 mail.
