Description:
 Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
 slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions
 EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key
 or DSA parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters
 that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may
 lead to a Denial of Service. The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or
 EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some of
 those computations take a long time if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too
 large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not
 allow using public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length
 for signature verification. However the key and parameter check functions
 do not limit the modulus size when performing the checks. An application
 that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies a
 key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to
 a Denial of Service attack. These functions are not called by OpenSSL
 itself on untrusted DSA keys so only applications that directly call these
 functions may be vulnerable. Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and
 pkeyparam command line applications when using the `-check` option. The
 OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL
 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.
