Description:
 Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability
 involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists
 starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5.
 On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow
 that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap
 contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves
 changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very
 large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This
 problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit
 binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this
 issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching
 the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the
 `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to
 restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.
