Description:
 Npgsql is the .NET data provider for PostgreSQL. The `WriteBind()` method
 in `src/Npgsql/Internal/NpgsqlConnector.FrontendMessages.cs` uses `int`
 variables to store the message length and the sum of parameter lengths.
 Both variables overflow when the sum of parameter lengths becomes too
 large. This causes Npgsql to write a message size that is too small when
 constructing a Postgres protocol message to send it over the network to the
 database. When parsing the message, the database will only read a small
 number of bytes and treat any following bytes as new messages while they
 belong to the old message. Attackers can abuse this to inject arbitrary
 Postgres protocol messages into the connection, leading to the execution of
 arbitrary SQL statements on the application's behalf. This vulnerability is
 fixed in 4.0.14, 4.1.13, 5.0.18, 6.0.11, 7.0.7, and 8.0.3.
