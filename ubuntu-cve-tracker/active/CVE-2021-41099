Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An
 integer overflow bug in the underlying string library can be used to
 corrupt the heap and potentially result with denial of service or remote
 code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default
 proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter to a very large value and
 constructing specially crafted network payloads or commands. The problem is
 fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround
 to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to
 prevent users from modifying the proto-max-bulk-len configuration
 parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from
 using the CONFIG SET command.
