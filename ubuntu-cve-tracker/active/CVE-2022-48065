Description:
 GNU Binutils before 2.40 was discovered to contain a memory leak
 vulnerability var the function find_abstract_instance in dwarf2.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> binutils isn't safe for untrusted inputs.
 ccdm94> binutils in bionic and earlier does not include commit 422f3d3d.
 ccdm94> In this commit, function 'find_abstract_instance' was included,
 ccdm94> and with it, the 'DW_AT_decl_file' case, which is where the
 ccdm94> memory leak occurs. The patch provided by upstream also fixes
 ccdm94> function 'scan_unit_for_symbols', which could also cause a memory
 ccdm94> leak for similar reasons as the other function. Fixing
 ccdm94> 'find_abstract_instance' in bionic and earlier is not possible
 ccdm94> as the code being fixed is not present. Fixing
 ccdm94> 'scan_unit_for_symbols' would only introduce possibly undefined
 ccdm94> behavior, as the patch frees a variable that in bionic and earlier,
 ccdm94> is not initialized by 'find_abstract_instance' and is not
 ccdm94> initialized by the alternative there present,
 ccdm94> 'find_abstract_instance_name', that doesn't even consider a
 ccdm94> filename for an argument.
