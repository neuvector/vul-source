Description:
 A flaw was found in GnuTLS. A double-free vulnerability exists in GnuTLS
 due to incorrect ownership handling in the export logic of Subject
 Alternative Name (SAN) entries containing an otherName. If the type-id OID
 is invalid or malformed, GnuTLS will call asn1_delete_structure() on an
 ASN.1 node it does not own, leading to a double-free condition when the
 parent function or caller later attempts to free the same structure.
 
 This vulnerability can be triggered using only public GnuTLS APIs and may
 result in denial of service or memory corruption, depending on allocator
 behavior.
