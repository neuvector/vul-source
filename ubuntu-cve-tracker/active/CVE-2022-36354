Description:
 A heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the RLA format parser of
 OpenImageIO master-branch-9aeece7a and v2.3.19.0. More specifically, in the
 way run-length encoded byte spans are handled. A malformed RLA file can
 lead to an out-of-bounds read of heap metadata which can result in
 sensitive information leak. An attacker can provide a malicious file to
 trigger this vulnerability.
