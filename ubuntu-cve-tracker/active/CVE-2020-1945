Description:
 Apache Ant 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 uses the default temporary
 directory identified by the Java system property java.io.tmpdir for several
 tasks and may thus leak sensitive information. The fixcrlf and
 replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into
 the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into
 the build process.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Apache Ant created temporary files with insecure
 permissions. An attacker could use this vulnerability to read sensitive
 information leaked into /tmp, or potentially inject malicious code into a
 project that is built with Apache Ant.
Notes:
 msalvatore> There are two potential mitigations for this vulnerability.
 msalvatore>   1) Set your umask to 077.
 msalvatore>   2) Set your JVM's java.io.tmpdir system property to a directory
 msalvatore>      only readable and writable by the current user running Ant.
 msalvatore> The fix for this CVE is incomplete. CVE-2020-11979 finishes resolving the issue.
Mitigation:
 Set the java.io.tmpdir property of the JVM to point to a directory that is not
 world read/writable.
