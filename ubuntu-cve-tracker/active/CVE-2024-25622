Description:
 h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The
 configuration directives provided by the headers handler allows users to
 modify the response headers being sent by h2o. The configuration file of
 h2o has scopes, and the inner scopes (e.g., path level) are expected to
 inherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g., global level).
 However, if a header directive is used in the inner scope, all the
 definition in outer scopes are ignored. This can lead to headers not being
 modified as expected. Depending on the headers being added or removed
 unexpectedly, this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior. This
 vulnerability is fixed in commit 123f5e2b65dcdba8f7ef659a00d24bd1249141be.
