Description:
 To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive
 resolver occasionally attempts to clean up the database. It uses several
 methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of memory
 pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and
 then queued for later processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is
 continuously processing query patterns triggering this type of
 cache-database maintenance, `named` may not be able to handle the cleanup
 events in a timely manner. This in turn enables the list of queued cleanup
 events to grow infinitely large over time, allowing the configured
 `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded. This issue affects
 BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.45 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1.
