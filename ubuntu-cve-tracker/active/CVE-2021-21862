 Multiple exploitable integer truncation vulnerabilities exist within the
 MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content
 library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper
 memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes
 memory corruption The implementation of the parser used for the “Xtra”
 FOURCC code is handled. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to
 trigger this vulnerability.
