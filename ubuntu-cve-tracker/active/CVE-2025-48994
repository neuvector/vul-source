Description:
 SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python.
 When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and
 HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False,
 hmac_key=...`), versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a
 potential algorithm confusion attack. Unless the user explicitly limits the
 expected signature algorithms using the
 `signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(expect_config=...)` setting, an attacker may
 supply a signature unexpectedly signed with a key other than the provided
 HMAC key, using a different (asymmetric key) signature algorithm. Starting
 with SignXML 4.0.4, specifying `hmac_key` causes the set of accepted
 signature algorithms to be restricted to HMAC only, if not already
 restricted by the user.
