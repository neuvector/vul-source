Description:
 An integer overflow in the case of failed ACME certificate renewal leads,
 after a number of failures (~30 days in default configurations), to the
 backoff timer becoming 0. Attempts to renew the certificate then are
 repeated without delays until it succeeds.
 
 This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.30 before 2.4.66.
 
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.66, which fixes the issue.
