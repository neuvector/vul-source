Description:
 A vulnerability was found in WebAssembly wabt up to 1.0.37. It has been
 classified as problematic. Affected is the function OnDataCount of the file
 src/interp/binary-reader-interp.cc. The manipulation leads to resource
 consumption. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been
 disclosed to the public and may be used. A similar issue reported during
 the same timeframe was disputed by the code maintainer because it might not
 affect "real world wasm programs". Therefore, this entry might get disputed
 as well in the future.
