Description:
 Unlike 32-bit PV guests, HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit and
 other modes. This in particular means that they may set registers used to
 pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range 32-bit
 code would be able to set them to. When processing of hypercalls takes a
 considerable amount of time, the hypervisor may choose to invoke a
 hypercall continuation. Doing so involves putting (perhaps updated)
 hypercall arguments in respective registers. For guests not running in
 64-bit mode this further involves a certain amount of translation of the
 values. Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values
 assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a
 hypercall. When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a consistency
 check in the hypervisor and causes a crash.
