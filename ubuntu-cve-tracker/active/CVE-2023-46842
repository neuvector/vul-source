Description:
 Unlike 32-bit PV guests, HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit and
 other modes.  This in particular means that they may set registers used
 to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range
 32-bit code would be able to set them to.
 
 When processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time,
 the hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so
 involves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective
 registers.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves
 a certain amount of translation of the values.
 
 Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values
 assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a
 hypercall.  When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a
 consistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash.
