Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
 STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a
 dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs
 can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed .
 The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table
 multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior
 such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A
 patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which
 will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for
 this issue.
