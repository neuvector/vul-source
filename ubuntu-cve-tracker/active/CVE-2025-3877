Description:
 A crafted HTML email using mailbox:/// links can trigger automatic,
 unsolicited downloads of .pdf files to the user's desktop or home directory
 without prompting, even if auto-saving is disabled. This behavior can be
 abused to fill the disk with garbage data (e.g. using /dev/urandom on
 Linux) or to leak Windows credentials via SMB links when the email is
 viewed in HTML mode. While user interaction is required to download the
 .pdf file, visual obfuscation can conceal the download trigger. Viewing the
 email in HTML mode is enough to load external content. This vulnerability
 affects Thunderbird < 128.10.1 and Thunderbird < 138.0.1.
