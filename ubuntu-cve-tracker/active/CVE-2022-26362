Description:
 x86 pv: Race condition in typeref acquisition Xen maintains a type
 reference count for pages, in addition to a regular reference count. This
 scheme is used to maintain invariants required for Xen's safety, e.g. PV
 guests may not have direct writeable access to pagetables; updates need
 auditing by Xen. Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type reference
 has a race condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early and
 creates a window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mapping
 before writeability is prohibited.
