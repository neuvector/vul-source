Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Neither xenstore
 implementation does any permission checks when reporting a xenstore watch
 event. A guest administrator can watch the root xenstored node, which will
 cause notifications for every created, modified, and deleted key. A guest
 administrator can also use the special watches, which will cause a
 notification every time a domain is created and destroyed. Data may
 include: number, type, and domids of other VMs; existence and domids of
 driver domains; numbers of virtual interfaces, block devices, vcpus;
 existence of virtual framebuffers and their backend style (e.g., existence
 of VNC service); Xen VM UUIDs for other domains; timing information about
 domain creation and device setup; and some hints at the backend
 provisioning of VMs and their devices. The watch events do not contain
 values stored in xenstore, only key names. A guest administrator can
 observe non-sensitive domain and device lifecycle events relating to other
 guests. This information allows some insight into overall system
 configuration (including the number and general nature of other guests),
 and configuration of other guests (including the number and general nature
 of other guests' devices). This information might be commercially
 interesting or might make other attacks easier. There is not believed to be
 exposure of sensitive data. Specifically, there is no exposure of VNC
 passwords, port numbers, pathnames in host and guest filesystems,
 cryptographic keys, or within-guest data.
