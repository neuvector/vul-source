Description:
 A vulnerability was found in libxml2 up to 2.14.5. It has been declared as
 problematic. This vulnerability affects the function xmlParseSGMLCatalog of
 the component xmlcatalog. The manipulation leads to uncontrolled recursion.
 Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the
 public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still
 doubted at the moment. The code maintainer explains, that "[t]he issue can
 only be triggered with untrusted SGML catalogs and it makes absolutely no
 sense to use untrusted catalogs. I also doubt that anyone is still using
 SGML catalogs at all."
