Description:
 In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed
 significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly
 drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used to
 effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-out
 value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual
 read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP
 repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can
 continuously extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since
 validation will only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has
 concluded, this delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator
 continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run
 directly after starting, never serve any data at all.
