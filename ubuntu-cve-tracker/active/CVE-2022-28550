Description:
 Matthias-Wandel/jhead jhead 3.06 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via
 shellescape(), jhead.c, jhead. jhead copies strings to a stack buffer when
 it detects a &i or &o. However, jhead does not check the boundary of the
 stack buffer. As a result, there will be a stack buffer overflow problem
 when multiple `&i` or `&o` are given.
