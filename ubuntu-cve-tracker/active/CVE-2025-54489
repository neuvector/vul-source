Description:
 A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing
 functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch
 (35a819fa). A specially crafted MFER file can lead to arbitrary code
 execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this
 vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 8970 of biosig.c on the
 current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 63:
 
                 else if (tag==63) {
                     uint8_t tag2=255, len2=255;
 
                     count = 0;
                     while ((count<len) && !(FlagInfiniteLength && len2==0
 && tag2==0)){
                         curPos += ifread(&tag2,1,1,hdr);
                         curPos += ifread(&len2,1,1,hdr);
                         if (VERBOSE_LEVEL==9)
                             fprintf(stdout,"MFER: tag=%3i chan=%2i len=%-4i
 tag2=%3i len2=%3i curPos=%i %li
 count=%4i\n",tag,chan,len,tag2,len2,curPos,iftell(hdr),(int)count);
 
                         if (FlagInfiniteLength && len2==0 && tag2==0)
 break;
 
                         count  += (2+len2);
                         curPos += ifread(&buf,1,len2,hdr);
 
 Here, the number of bytes read is not the Data Length decoded from the
 current frame in the file (`len`) but rather is a new length contained in a
 single octet read from the same input file (`len2`). Despite this, a
 stack-based buffer overflow condition can still occur, as the destination
 buffer is still `buf`, which has a size of only 128 bytes, while `len2` can
 be as large as 255.
