Description:
 The crewjam/saml go library contains a partial implementation of the SAML
 standard in golang. Prior to version 0.4.13, the package's use of
 `flate.NewReader` does not limit the size of the input. The user can pass
 more than 1 MB of data in the HTTP request to the processing functions,
 which will be decompressed server-side using the Deflate algorithm.
 Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple times, it is possible
 to achieve a reliable crash since the operating system kills the process.
 This issue is patched in version 0.4.13.
