Description:
 Cacti is a robust performance and fault management framework and a frontend
 to RRDTool - a Time Series Database (TSDB). A vulnerability in versions
 prior to 1.2.27 bypasses an earlier fix for CVE-2023-39360, therefore
 leading to a DOM XSS attack. Exploitation of the vulnerability is possible
 for an authorized user. The vulnerable component is the `graphs_new.php`.
 The impact of the vulnerability is execution of arbitrary JavaScript code
 in the attacked user's browser. This issue has been patched in version
 1.2.27.
