Description:
 GENIVI Diagnostic Log and Trace (DLT) provides a log and trace interface.
 In versions of GENIVI DLT between 2.10.0 and 2.18.6, a configuration file
 containing the special characters could cause a vulnerable component to
 crash. All the applications which are using the configuration file could
 fail to generate their dlt logs in system. As of time of publication, no
 patch exists. As a workaround, one may check the integrity of information
 in configuration file manually.
