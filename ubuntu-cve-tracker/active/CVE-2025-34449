Description:
 Genymobile/scrcpy versions up to and including 3.3.3, prior to commit
 3e40b24, contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
 sc_device_msg_deserialize() function. A compromised device can send crafted
 messages that cause out-of-bounds reads, which may result in memory
 corruption or a denial-of-service condition. This vulnerability may allow
 further exploitation on the host system.
