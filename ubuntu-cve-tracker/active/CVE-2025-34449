Description:
 Genymobile/scrcpy versions up to and including 3.3.3 and prior to commit
 3e40b24 contain a global buffer overflow vulnerability in the function
 sc_read32be, invoked via sc_device_msg_deserialize() and process_msgs().
 Processing crafted device messages can cause reads beyond the bounds of a
 global buffer, leading to memory corruption or crashes. This vulnerability
 can be exploited to cause a denial of service and, under certain
 conditions, may be leveraged for further exploitation depending on the
 execution environment and available mitigations.
