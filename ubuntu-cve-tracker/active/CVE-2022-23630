Description:
 Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for
 multi-language development. In some cases, Gradle may skip that
 verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as
 an untrusted external artifact. This occurs when dependency verification is
 disabled on one or more configurations and those configurations have common
 dependencies with other configurations that have dependency verification
 enabled. If the configuration that has dependency verification disabled is
 resolved first, Gradle does not verify the common dependencies for the
 configuration that has dependency verification enabled. Gradle 7.4 fixes
 that issue by validating artifacts at least once if they are present in a
 resolved configuration that has dependency verification active. For users
 who cannot update either do not use
 `ResolutionStrategy.disableDependencyVerification()` and do not use plugins
 that use that method to disable dependency verification for a single
 configuration or make sure resolution of configuration that disable that
 feature do not happen in builds that resolve configuration where the
 feature is enabled.
