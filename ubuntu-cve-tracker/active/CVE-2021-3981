Description:
 A flaw in grub2 was found where its configuration file, known as grub.cfg,
 is being created with the wrong permission set allowing non privileged
 users to read its content. This represents a low severity confidentiality
 issue, as those users can eventually read any encrypted passwords present
 in grub.cfg. This flaw affects grub2 2.06 and previous versions. This issue
 has been fixed in grub upstream but no version with the fix is currently
 released.
