Description:
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default
 encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means
 anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to
 change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must
 be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns
 or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing
 the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi;
 but storing them again from the UI will work.
