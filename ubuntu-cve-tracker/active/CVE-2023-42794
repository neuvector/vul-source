Description:
 Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. The internal fork of
 Commons FileUpload packaged with Apache Tomcat 9.0.70 through 9.0.80 and
 8.5.85 through 8.5.93 included an unreleased, in progress refactoring that
 exposed a potential denial of service on Windows if a web application
 opened a stream for an uploaded file but failed to close the stream. The
 file would never be deleted from disk creating the possibility of an
 eventual denial of service due to the disk being full. Users are
 recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which
 fixes the issue.
