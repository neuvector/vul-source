Description:
 In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to
 2.4.63, an access control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS
 1.3 session resumption.
 
 Configurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual
 hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client
 certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path
 setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may
 be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not
 enabled in either virtual host.
