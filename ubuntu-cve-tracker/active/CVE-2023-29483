Description:
 eventlet before 0.35.2, as used in dnspython before 2.6.0, allows remote
 attackers to interfere with DNS name resolution by quickly sending an
 invalid packet from the expected IP address and source port, aka a "TuDoor"
 attack. In other words, dnspython does not have the preferred behavior in
 which the DNS name resolution algorithm would proceed, within the full time
 window, in order to wait for a valid packet. NOTE: dnspython 2.6.0 is
 unusable for a different reason that was addressed in 2.6.1.
