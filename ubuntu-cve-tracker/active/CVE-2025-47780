Description:
 Asterisk is an open-source private branch exchange (PBX). Prior to versions
 18.26.2, 20.14.1, 21.9.1, and 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14
 and 20.7-cert5 of certified-asterisk, trying to disallow shell commands to
 be run via the Asterisk command line interface (CLI) by configuring
 `cli_permissions.conf` (e.g. with the config line `deny=!*`) does not work
 which could lead to a security risk. If an administrator running an
 Asterisk instance relies on the `cli_permissions.conf` file to work and
 expects it to deny all attempts to execute shell commands, then this could
 lead to a security vulnerability. Versions 18.26.2, 20.14.1, 21.9.1, and
 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14 and 20.7-cert5 of
 certified-asterisk fix the issue.
