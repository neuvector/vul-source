Description:
 redis-py before 4.4.4 and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 leaves a connection open after
 canceling an async Redis command at an inopportune time, and can send
 response data to the client of an unrelated request. (This could, for
 example, happen for a non-pipeline operation.) NOTE: the solutions for
 CVE-2023-28859 address data leakage across AsyncIO connections in general.
