Description:
 tinymce is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability was discovered in the alert and confirm dialogs when these
 dialogs were provided with malicious HTML content. This can occur in
 plugins that use the alert or confirm dialogs, such as in the `image`
 plugin, which presents these dialogs when certain errors occur. The
 vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an alert
 presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user. This vulnerability has
 been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.7 and TinyMCE 6.3.1 by ensuring HTML
 sanitization was still performed after unwrapping invalid elements. Users
 are advised to upgrade to either 5.10.7 or 6.3.1. Users unable to upgrade
 may ensure the the `images_upload_handler` returns a valid value as per the
 images_upload_handler documentation.
