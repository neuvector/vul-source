Description:
 An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt in versions before 3002.9,
 3003.5, 3004.2. PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts, which allows a
 previously authorized user whose account is locked still run Salt commands
 when their account is locked. This affects both local shell accounts with
 an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.
