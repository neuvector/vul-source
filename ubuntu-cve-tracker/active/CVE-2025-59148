Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Versions 8.0.0
 and below incorrectly handle the entropy keyword when not anchored to a
 "sticky" buffer, which can lead to a segmentation fault. This issue is
 fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules
 using the entropy keyword, or validate they are anchored to a sticky
 buffer.
