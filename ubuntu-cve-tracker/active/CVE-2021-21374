Description:
 Nimble is a package manager for the Nim programming language. In Nim
 release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, "nimble refresh" fetches
 a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS without full verification of the
 SSL/TLS certificate due to the default setting of httpClient. An attacker
 able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing
 malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the
 attack escalates to untrusted code execution.
