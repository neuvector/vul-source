Description:
 A buffer overflow in modsecurity v3.0.12 allows attackers to cause a Denial
 of Service (DoS) via a crafted input inserted into the name parameter.
 NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because it cannot be reproduced.
 Also, the product's documentation indicates that it is not guaranteed to be
 usable with very large values of SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit (which are
 required by the claimed issue).
