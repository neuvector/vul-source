Description:
 Redmine before 3.2.9, 3.3.x before 3.3.6, and 3.4.x before 3.4.4 does not
 block the --config and --debugger flags to the Mercurial hg program, which
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands (through the
 Mercurial adapter) via vectors involving a branch whose name begins with a
 --config= or --debugger= substring, a related issue to CVE-2017-17536.
