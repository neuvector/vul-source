Description:
 wall in util-linux through 2.40, often installed with setgid tty
 permissions, allows escape sequences to be sent to other users' terminals
 through argv. (Specifically, escape sequences received from stdin are
 blocked, but escape sequences received from argv are not blocked.) There
 may be plausible scenarios where this leads to account takeover.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> USN-6719-1 added patches, but it turned out they were
 mdeslaur> insufficient to completely fix the issue, so -2 was released
 mdeslaur> which removes the setgid bit from the wall and write binaries.
