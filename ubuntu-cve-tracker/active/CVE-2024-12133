Description:
 A flaw in libtasn1 causes inefficient handling of specific certificate
 data. When processing a large number of elements in a certificate, libtasn1
 takes much longer than expected, which can slow down or even crash the
 system. This flaw allows an attacker to send a specially crafted
 certificate, causing a denial of service attack.
