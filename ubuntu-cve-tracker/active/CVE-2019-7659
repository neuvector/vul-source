Description:
 Genivia gSOAP 2.7.x and 2.8.x before 2.8.75 allows attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application abort) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact if a server application is built with the -DWITH_COOKIES flag. This
 affects the C/C++ libgsoapck/libgsoapck++ and libgsoapssl/libgsoapssl++
 libraries, as these are built with that flag.
