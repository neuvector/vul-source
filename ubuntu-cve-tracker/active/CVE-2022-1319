Description:
 A flaw was found in Undertow. For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly
 sending two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set
 even though JBoss EAP closes the connection. A failure occurs when the
 connection is reused after a 400 by CPING since it reads in the second
 SEND_HEADERS response packet instead of a CPONG.
