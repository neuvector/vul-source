Description:
 In lighttpd 1.4.65, mod_wstunnel does not initialize a handler function
 pointer if an invalid HTTP request (websocket handshake) is received. It
 leads to null pointer dereference which crashes the server. It could be
 used by an external attacker to cause denial of service condition.
