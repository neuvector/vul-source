Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.20,
 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, a possible information disclosure vulnerability existed
 in `Rack::Sendfile` when running behind a proxy that supports `x-sendfile`
 headers (such as Nginx). Specially crafted headers could cause
 `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the proxy and trigger unintended
 internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level access restrictions.
 When `Rack::Sendfile` received untrusted `x-sendfile-type` or
 `x-accel-mapping` headers from a client, it would interpret them as proxy
 configuration directives. This could cause the middleware to send a
 "redirect" response to the proxy, prompting it to reissue a new internal
 request that was not subject to the proxy's access controls. An attacker
 could exploit this by setting a crafted `x-sendfile-type: x-accel-redirect`
 header, setting a crafted `x-accel-mapping` header, and requesting a path
 that qualifies for proxy-based acceleration. Attackers could bypass
 proxy-enforced restrictions and access internal endpoints intended to be
 protected (such as administrative pages). The vulnerability did not allow
 arbitrary file reads but could expose sensitive application routes. This
 issue only affected systems meeting all of the following conditions: The
 application used `Rack::Sendfile` with a proxy that supports
 `x-accel-redirect` (e.g., Nginx); the proxy did **not** always set or
 remove the `x-sendfile-type` and `x-accel-mapping` headers; and the
 application exposed an endpoint that returned a body responding to
 `.to_path`. Users should upgrade to Rack versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3,
 which require explicit configuration to enable `x-accel-redirect`.
 Alternatively, configure the proxy to always set or strip the header, or in
 Rails applications, disable sendfile completely.
