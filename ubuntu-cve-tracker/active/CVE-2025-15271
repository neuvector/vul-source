Description:
 FontForge SFD File Parsing Improper Validation of Array Index Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to

 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SFD files. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result
 in a write past the end of an allocated array. An attacker can leverage
