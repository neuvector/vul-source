Description:
 When the Node.js policy feature checks the integrity of a resource against
 a trusted manifest, the application can intercept the operation and return
 a forged checksum to the node's policy implementation, thus effectively
 disabling the integrity check. Impacts: This vulnerability affects all
 users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines:
 18.x and, 20.x. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the
 policy mechanism is an experimental feature of Node.js.
