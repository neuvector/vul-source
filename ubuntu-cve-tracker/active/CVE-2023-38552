Description:
 When the Node.js policy feature checks the integrity of a resource against
 a trusted manifest, the application can intercept the operation and return
 a forged checksum to the node's policy implementation, thus effectively
 disabling the integrity check.
 Impacts:
 This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental policy
 mechanism in all active release lines: 18.x and, 20.x.
 Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy mechanism is
 an experimental feature of Node.js.
