Description:
 Plexis Archiver is a collection of Plexus components to create archives or
 extract archives to a directory with a unified `Archiver`/`UnArchiver` API.
 Prior to version 4.8.0, using AbstractUnArchiver for extracting an archive
 might lead to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code
 execution. When extracting an archive with an entry that already exists in
 the destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist -
 the `resolveFile()` function will return the symlink's source instead of
 its target, which will pass the verification that ensures the file will not
 be extracted outside of the destination directory. Later
 `Files.newOutputStream()`, that follows symlinks by default, will actually
 write the entry's content to the symlink's target. Whoever uses plexus
 archiver to extract an untrusted archive is vulnerable to an arbitrary file
 creation and possibly remote code execution. Version 4.8.0 contains a patch
 for this issue.
