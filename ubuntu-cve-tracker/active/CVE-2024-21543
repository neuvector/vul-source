Description:
 Versions of the package djoser before 2.3.0 are vulnerable to
 Authentication Bypass when the authenticate() function fails. This is
 because the system falls back to querying the database directly, granting
 access to users with valid credentials, and eventually bypassing custom
 authentication checks such as two-factor authentication, LDAP validations,
 or requirements from configured AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS.
