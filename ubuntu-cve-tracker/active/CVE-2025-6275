Description:
 A vulnerability was found in WebAssembly wabt up to 1.0.37. It has been
 declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function
 GetFuncOffset of the file src/interp/binary-reader-interp.cc. The
 manipulation leads to use after free. It is possible to launch the attack
 on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be
 used. A similar issue reported during the same timeframe was disputed by
 the code maintainer because it might not affect "real world wasm programs".
 Therefore, this entry might get disputed as well in the future.
