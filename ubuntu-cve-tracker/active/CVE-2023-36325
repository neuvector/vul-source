Description:
 i2p before 2.3.0 (Java) allows de-anonymizing the public IPv4 and IPv6
 addresses of i2p hidden services (aka eepsites) via a correlation attack
 across the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that occurs when a tunneled, replayed
 message has a behavior discrepancy (it may be dropped, or may result in a
 Wrong Destination response). An attack would take days to complete.
