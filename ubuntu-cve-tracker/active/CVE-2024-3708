Description:
 A condition exists in lighttpd version prior to 1.4.51 whereby a remote
 attacker can craft an http request which could result in multiple outcomes:
 1.) cause lighttpd to access freed memory in which case the process
 lighttpd is running in could be terminated or other non-deterministic
 behavior could result 2.) a memory information disclosure event could
 result which could be used to determine the state of memory which could
 then be used to theoretically bypass ALSR protections This CVE will be
 updated with more details on July 9th, 2024 after affected parties have had
 time to remediate.
