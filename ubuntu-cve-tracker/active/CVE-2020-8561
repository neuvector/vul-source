Description:
 A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where actors that control the
 responses of MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
 requests are able to redirect kube-apiserver requests to private networks
 of the apiserver. If that user can view kube-apiserver logs when the log
 level is set to 10, they can view the redirected responses and headers in
 the logs.
