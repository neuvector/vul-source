Description:
 mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache
 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party,
 authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In
 mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.9, the AES GCM encryption in
 mod_auth_openidc uses a static IV and AAD. It is important to fix because
 this creates a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can
 lead to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused.
 From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use dynamic values through
 usage of cjose AES encryption routines.
