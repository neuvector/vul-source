Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to
 versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a large HTTP content type, when logged can cause
 a stack overflow crashing Suricata. This issue has been patched in versions
 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves limiting
 stream.reassembly.depth to less then half the stack size. Increasing the
 process stack size makes it less likely the bug will trigger.
