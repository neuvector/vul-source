 https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsoup/-/issues/476
Description:
 A flaw was found in libsoup’s WebSocket frame processing when handling
 incoming messages. If a non-default configuration is used where the maximum
 incoming payload size is unset, the library may read memory outside the
 intended bounds. This can cause unintended memory exposure or a crash.
 Applications using libsoup’s WebSocket support with this configuration may
 be impacted.
