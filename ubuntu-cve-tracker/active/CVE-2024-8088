 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7015-1
Description:
 There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython "zipfile"
 module affecting "zipfile.Path". Note that the more common API
 "zipfile.ZipFile" class is unaffected.
 
 
 
 
 
 When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods
 of "zipfile.Path" like "namelist()", "iterdir()", etc)
 the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted
 zip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting
 the contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling
 user-controlled zip archives are not affected.

 mdeslaur> possibly related to this issue.
