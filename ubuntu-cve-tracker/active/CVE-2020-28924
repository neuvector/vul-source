Description:
 An issue was discovered in Rclone before 1.53.3. Due to the use of a weak
 random number generator, the password generator has been producing weak
 passwords with much less entropy than advertised. The suggested passwords
 depend deterministically on the time the second rclone was started. This
 limits the entropy of the passwords enormously. These passwords are often
 used in the crypt backend for encryption of data. It would be possible to
 make a dictionary of all possible passwords with about 38 million entries
 per password length. This would make decryption of secret material possible
 with a plausible amount of effort. NOTE: all passwords generated by
 affected versions should be changed.
