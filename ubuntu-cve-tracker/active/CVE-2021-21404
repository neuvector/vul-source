Description:
 Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before
 version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and
 exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly,
 Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message
 from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay
 joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and
 Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely
 to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.
