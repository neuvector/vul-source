Description:
 TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s Notification Manager API. The
 vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification system, which is
 used in error handling. The conditions for this exploit requires carefully
 crafted malicious content to have been inserted into the editor and a
 notification to have been triggered. When a notification was opened, the
 HTML within the text argument was displayed unfiltered in the notification.
 The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an
 notification presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user. This issue
 could also be exploited by any integration which uses a TinyMCE
 notification to display unfiltered HTML content. This vulnerability has
 been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring that the HTML
 displayed in the notification is sanitized, preventing the exploit. Users
 are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
