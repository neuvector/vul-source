Description:
 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
 vulnerability in QFileSystemEngine in the Qt corelib module on Windows
 which potentially allows Symlink Attacks and the use of Malicious Files.
 Issue originates from CVE-2024-38081. The vulnerability arises from the use
 of the GetTempPath API, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate
 temporary file paths, potentially leading to unauthorized access and
 privilege escalation. The affected public API in the Qt Framework is
 QDir::tempPath() and anything that uses it, such as QStandardPaths with
 TempLocation, QTemporaryDir, and QTemporaryFile.This issue affects all
 version of Qt up to and including 5.15.18, from 6.0.0 through 6.5.8, from
 6.6.0 through 6.8.1. It is fixed in Qt 5.15.19, Qt 6.5.9, Qt 6.8.2, 6.9.0
