Description:
 GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements
 NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, an incorrect free when
 decoding target information can trigger a denial of service. The error
 condition incorrectly assumes the `cb` and `sh` buffers contain a copy of
 the data that needs to be freed. However, that is not the case. This
 vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry
 point. This will likely trigger an assertion failure in `free`, causing a
 denial-of-service. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.
