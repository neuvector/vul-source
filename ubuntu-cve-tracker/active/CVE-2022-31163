Description:
 TZInfo is a Ruby library that provides access to time zone data and allows
 times to be converted using time zone rules. Versions prior to 0.36.1, as
 well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data source
 tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby data
 source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time
 zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected
 versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers
 correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby
 version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load
 unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process.
 Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone
 identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61
 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name
 follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a
 prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path.
 Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a
 directory on the load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier can
 be validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it
 matches the regular expression
 `\A[A-Za-z0-9+\-_]+(?:\/[A-Za-z0-9+\-_]+)*\z`.
