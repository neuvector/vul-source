Description:
 There's a flaw in Python 3's pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who
 discovers or is able to convince another local or adjacent user to start a
 pydoc server could access the server and use it to disclose sensitive
 information belonging to the other user that they would not normally be
 able to access. The highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality.
 This flaw affects Python versions before 3.8.9, Python versions before
 3.9.3 and Python versions before 3.10.0a7.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> getfile introduced in 3.2.0
 sbeattie> upstream fixed this by removing the getfile feature
Mitigation:
 Do not expose the pydoc webserver to untrusted users.
