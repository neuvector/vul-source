Description:
 body-parser 2.2.0 is vulnerable to denial of service due to inefficient
 handling of URL-encoded bodies with very large numbers of parameters. An
 attacker can send payloads containing thousands of parameters within the
 default 100KB request size limit, causing elevated CPU and memory usage.
 This can lead to service slowdown or partial outages under sustained
 malicious traffic.
 This issue is addressed in version 2.2.1.
