Description:
 OpenNDS, as used in Sierra Wireless ALEOS before 4.17.0.12 and other
 products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference, daemon crash, and Captive Portal outage) via a GET
 request to /opennds_auth/ that lacks a custom query string parameter and
 client-token.
