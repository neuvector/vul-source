Description:
 jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Open Redirect
 Vulnerability. Maliciously crafted login links to known Jupyter Servers can
 cause successful login or an already logged-in session to be redirected to
 arbitrary sites, which should be restricted to Jupyter Server-served URLs.
 This issue has been addressed in commit `29036259` which is included in
 release 2.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
 for this vulnerability.
