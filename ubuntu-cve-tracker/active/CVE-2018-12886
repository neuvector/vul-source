Description:
 stack_protect_prologue in cfgexpand.c and stack_protect_epilogue in
 function.c in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.1 through 8 (under certain
 circumstances) generate instruction sequences when targeting ARM targets
 that spill the address of the stack protector guard, which allows an
 attacker to bypass the protection of -fstack-protector,
 -fstack-protector-all, -fstack-protector-strong, and
 -fstack-protector-explicit against stack overflow by controlling what the
 stack canary is compared against.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Upstream has fixed this in GCC9 only as of 2019-05-30.
 mdeslaur> 32-bit ARM only, risky backport, and would require archive
 mdeslaur> rebuild.
 mdeslaur> Setting priority as low for now, we may decide this issue is
 mdeslaur> not worth fixing in stable releases.
 sbeattie> 14.04 LTS (trusty) Pro Infra and 16.04 LTS (xenial) Pro Infra
  do not support 32-bit Arm as an architecture.
