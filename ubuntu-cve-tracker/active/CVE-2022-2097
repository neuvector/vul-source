Description:
 AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised
 implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some
 circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting
 in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of "in place"
 encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL
 does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both
 unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL
 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).
