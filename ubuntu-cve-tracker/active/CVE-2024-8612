Description:
 A flaw was found in QEMU, in the virtio-scsi, virtio-blk, and virtio-crypto
 devices. The size for virtqueue_push as set in virtio_scsi_complete_req /
 virtio_blk_req_complete / virito_crypto_req_complete could be larger than
 the true size of the data which has been sent to guest. Once
 virtqueue_push() finally calls dma_memory_unmap to ummap the in_iov, it may
 call the address_space_write function to write back the data. Some
 uninitialized data may exist in the bounce.buffer, leading to an
 information leak.
