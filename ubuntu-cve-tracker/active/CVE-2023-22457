Description:
 CKEditor Integration UI adds support for editing wiki pages using CKEditor.
 Prior to versions 1.64.3,t he `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` document lacked a
 protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing to execute
 macros with the rights of the current user. If a privileged user with
 programming rights was tricked into executing a GET request to this
 document with certain parameters (e.g., via an image with a corresponding
 URL embedded in a comment or via a redirect), this would allow arbitrary
 remote code execution and the attacker could gain rights, access private
 information or impact the availability of the wiki. The issue has been
 patched in the CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also been
 patched in the version of the CKEditor integration that is bundled starting
 with XWiki 14.6 RC1. There are no known workarounds for this other than
 upgrading the CKEditor integration to a fixed version.
