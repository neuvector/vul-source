Description:
 A cleverly devised username might bypass LDAP authentication checks. In
 LDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this could let an attacker fill
 up the disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-authenticated
 Derby installations, this could also allow the attacker to execute
 malware which was visible to and executable by the account which booted
 the Derby server. In LDAP-protected databases which weren't also
 protected by SQL GRANT/REVOKE authorization, this vulnerability could
 also let an attacker view and corrupt sensitive data and run sensitive
 database functions and procedures.
 
 Mitigation:
 
 Users should upgrade to Java 21 and Derby 10.17.1.0.
 
 Alternatively, users who wish to remain on older Java versions should
 build their own Derby distribution from one of the release families to
 which the fix was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the
 releases which correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11,
 and 8.
