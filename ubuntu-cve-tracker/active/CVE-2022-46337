Description:
 A cleverly devised username might bypass LDAP authentication checks. In
 LDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this could let an attacker fill up
 the disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-authenticated Derby
 installations, this could also allow the attacker to execute malware which
 was visible to and executable by the account which booted the Derby server.
 In LDAP-protected databases which weren't also protected by SQL
 GRANT/REVOKE authorization, this vulnerability could also let an attacker
 view and corrupt sensitive data and run sensitive database functions and
 procedures. Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Java 21 and Derby
 10.17.1.0. Alternatively, users who wish to remain on older Java versions
 should build their own Derby distribution from one of the release families
 to which the fix was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the
 releases which correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11, and
 8.
