Description:
 Improper access control within AMD SEV-SNP could allow an admin privileged
 attacker to write to the RMP during SNP initialization, potentially
 resulting in a loss of SEV-SNP guest memory integrity.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> AMD SB mentions fix in both SEV (amd/) and ucode
  (amd-ucode/) binaries. didn't find matches in upstream for SEV
  binaries but ucode versions found in upstream version: 2025-07-29
 rodrigo-zaiden> This is not planned to be fixed for the amd64-microcode
  package in Ubuntu 14.04 as that release was already outside of the LTS
  timeframe when this hardware platform was launched.
