Description:
 Python Social Auth is a social authentication/registration mechanism. In
 versions prior to 5.6.0, upon authentication, the user could be associated
 by e-mail even if the `associate_by_email` pipeline was not included. This
 could lead to account compromise when a third-party authentication service
 does not validate provided e-mail addresses or doesn't require unique
 e-mail addresses. Version 5.6.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, review
 the authentication service policy on e-mail addresses; many will not allow
 exploiting this vulnerability.
