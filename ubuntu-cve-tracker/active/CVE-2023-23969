Description:
 In Django 3.2 before 3.2.17, 4.0 before 4.0.9, and 4.1 before 4.1.6, the
 parsed values of Accept-Language headers are cached in order to avoid
 repetitive parsing. This leads to a potential denial-of-service vector via
 excessive memory usage if the raw value of Accept-Language headers is very
 large.
