Description:
 Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior
 to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may
 allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE).
 By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor
 could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary
 commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions
 OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround
 involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.
