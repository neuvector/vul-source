Description:
 In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, it is possible to have an entry
 index greater then the number of entries in the ReadAll method in
 wal/wal.go. This could cause issues when WAL entries are being read during
 consensus as an arbitrary etcd consensus participant could go down from a
 runtime panic when reading the entry.
