Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a race condition
 when migrating timers between x86 HVM vCPUs. When migrating timers of x86
 HVM guests between its vCPUs, the locking model used allows for a second
 vCPU of the same guest (also operating on the timers) to release a lock
 that it didn't acquire. The most likely effect of the issue is a hang or
 crash of the hypervisor, i.e., a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of
 Xen are affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not
 vulnerable. Only x86 HVM guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV and
 PVH cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only guests with more than one vCPU
 can exploit the vulnerability.
