Description:
 Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network
 resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for
 reporting. From version 2.4.0 through version 2.12.4, a vulnerability
 exists that may allow privilege escalation for authenticated API users.
 With a read-ony user's credentials, an attacker can view most attributes of
 all config objects including `ticket_salt` of `ApiListener`. This salt is
 enough to compute a ticket for every possible common name (CN). A ticket,
 the master node's certificate, and a self-signed certificate are enough to
 successfully request the desired certificate from Icinga. That certificate
 may in turn be used to steal an endpoint or API user's identity. Versions
 2.12.5 and 2.11.10 both contain a fix the vulnerability. As a workaround,
 one may either specify queryable types explicitly or filter out ApiListener
 objects.
