Description:
 Core creation allows users to replace "trusted" configset files with
 arbitrary configuration
 
 Solr instances that (1) use the "FileSystemConfigSetService" component (the
 default in "standalone" or "user-managed" mode), and (2) are running
 without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of
 privilege escalation wherein individual "trusted" configset files can be
 ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere
 on the filesystem.  These replacement config files are treated as "trusted"
 and can use "<lib>" tags to add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker
 might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.
 
 This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can
 protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and
 authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away
 from "FileSystemConfigSetService").  Users are also recommended to upgrade
 to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of "<lib>" tags
 by default.
