Description:
 A flaw was found in OpenJPEG in versions prior to 2.4.0. This flaw allows
 an attacker to provide specially crafted input to the conversion or
 encoding functionality, causing an out-of-bounds read. The highest threat
 from this vulnerability is system availability.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sahnaseredini> the fix is not complete in bionic as the poc is still working.
 sahnaseredini> Also there's a commit in the upstream (07d526e) that is
 sahnaseredini> reverting some optimisations and (apparently) fixes the issue,
 sahnaseredini> however, it does not relate to the CVE, and looks more like a
 sahnaseredini> bug fix.
