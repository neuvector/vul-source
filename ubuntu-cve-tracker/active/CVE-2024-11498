Description:
 There exists a stack buffer overflow in libjxl. A specifically-crafted file
 can cause the JPEG XL decoder to use large amounts of stack space (up to
 256mb is possible, maybe 512mb), potentially exhausting the stack. An
 attacker can craft a file that will cause excessive memory usage. We
 recommend upgrading past commit 65fbec56bc578b6b6ee02a527be70787bbd053b0.
