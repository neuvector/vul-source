Description:
 A vulnerability was found in the libreswan library. This security issue
 occurs when an IKEv1 Aggressive Mode packet is received with only
 unacceptable crypto algorithms, and the response packet is not sent with a
 zero responder SPI. When a subsequent packet is received where the sender
 reuses the libreswan responder SPI as its own initiator SPI, the pluto
 daemon state machine crashes. No remote code execution is possible. This
 CVE exists because of a CVE-2023-30570 security regression for libreswan
 package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2.
