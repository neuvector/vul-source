Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Undertow where the ProxyProtocolReadListener
 reuses the same StringBuilder instance across multiple requests. This issue
 occurs when the parseProxyProtocolV1 method processes multiple requests on
 the same HTTP connection. As a result, different requests may share the
 same StringBuilder instance, potentially leading to information leakage
 between requests or responses. In some cases, a value from a previous
 request or response may be erroneously reused, which could lead to
 unintended data exposure. This issue primarily results in errors and
 connection termination but creates a risk of data leakage in multi-request
 environments.
