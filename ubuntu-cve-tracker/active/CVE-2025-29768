Description:
 Vim, a text editor, is vulnerable to potential data loss with zip.vim and
 special crafted zip files in versions prior to 9.1.1198. The impact is
 medium because a user must be made to view such an archive with Vim and
 then press 'x' on such a strange filename. The issue has been fixed as of
 Vim patch v9.1.1198.
