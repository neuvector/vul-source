Description:
 Out-of-bounds array write in Xpdf 4.05 and earlier, triggered by long
 Unicode sequence in ActualText.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> In trusty to bionic, xpdf is built with poppler as the backend
 mdeslaur> library, so most xpdf issues don't apply to it. In jammy and
 mdeslaur> later, the xpdf package is actually xpopple, a fork that also
 mdeslaur> builds against poppler.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> As of 2024-05-22, there are no details on what the actual issue
 mdeslaur> or fix is, but poppler forked away from Xpdf a long time ago, so
 mdeslaur> unlikely to affect it. Marking as not-affected.
