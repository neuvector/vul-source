Description:
 A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43. It has been classified as
 problematic. This affects the function xstrdup of the file
 libiberty/xmalloc.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory
 leak. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an
 attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The
 exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended
 to apply a patch to fix this issue. The code maintainer explains: "I'm not
 going to commit some of the leak fixes I've been working on to the 2.44
 branch due to concern that would destabilise ld. All of the reported leaks
 in this bugzilla have been fixed on binutils master."
