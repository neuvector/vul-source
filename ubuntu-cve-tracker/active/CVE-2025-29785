Description:
 quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. The loss recovery
 logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be
 used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client. In
 order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different
 remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic:
 the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets
 received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer
 dereference. v0.50.1 contains a patch that fixes the vulnerability. This
 release contains a test that generates random sequences of sent packets
 (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the
 patch actually covers all corner cases. No known workarounds are available.
