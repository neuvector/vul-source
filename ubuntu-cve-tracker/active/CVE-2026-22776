Description:
 cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS
 library. Prior to version 0.30.1, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability
 exists in cpp-httplib due to the unsafe handling of compressed HTTP request
 bodies (Content-Encoding: gzip, br, etc.). The library validates the
 payload_max_length against the compressed data size received from the
 network, but does not limit the size of the decompressed data stored in
 memory.
