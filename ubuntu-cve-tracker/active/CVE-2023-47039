Description:
 [Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the
  shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable which uses Windows Perl
  interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating
  system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for
  cmd.exe in the current working directory.  An attacker with limited privileges
  can exploit this behavior by placing `cmd.exe` in locations with weak
  permissions, such as `C:\ProgramData`. By doing so, when an administrator
  attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations, arbitrary
  code can be executed.]
