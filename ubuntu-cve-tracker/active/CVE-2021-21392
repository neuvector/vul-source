Description:
 Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
 matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant
 Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.28.0 requests to user
 provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses when
 transitional IPv6 addresses were used. Outbound requests to federation,
 identity servers, when calculating the key validity for third-party invite
 events, sending push notifications, and generating URL previews are
 affected. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal
 infrastructure on dual-stack networks. See referenced GitHub security
 advisory for details and workarounds.
