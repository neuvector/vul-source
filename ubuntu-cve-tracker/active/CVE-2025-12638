Description:
 Keras version 3.11.3 is affected by a path traversal vulnerability in the
 keras.utils.get_file() function when extracting tar archives. The
 vulnerability arises because the function uses Python's
 tarfile.extractall() method without the security-critical filter='data'
 parameter. Although Keras attempts to filter unsafe paths using
 filter_safe_paths(), this filtering occurs before extraction, and a
 PATH_MAX symlink resolution bug triggers during extraction. This bug causes
 symlink resolution to fail due to path length limits, resulting in a
 security bypass that allows files to be written outside the intended
 extraction directory. This can lead to arbitrary file writes outside the
 cache directory, enabling potential system compromise or malicious code
 execution. The vulnerability affects Keras installations that process tar
 archives with get_file() and does not affect versions where this extraction
 method is secured with the appropriate filter parameter.
