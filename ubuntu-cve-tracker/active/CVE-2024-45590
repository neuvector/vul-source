Description:
 body-parser is Node.js body parsing middleware. body-parser <1.20.3 is
 vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled. A malicious
 actor using a specially crafted payload could flood the server with a large
 number of requests, resulting in denial of service. This issue is patched
 in 1.20.3.
