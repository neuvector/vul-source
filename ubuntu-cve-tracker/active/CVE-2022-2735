Description:
 A vulnerability was found in the PCS project. This issue occurs due to
 incorrect permissions on a Unix socket used for internal communication
 between PCS daemons. A privilege escalation could happen by obtaining an
 authentication token for a hacluster user. With the "hacluster" token, this
 flaw allows an attacker to have complete control over the cluster managed
 by PCS.
