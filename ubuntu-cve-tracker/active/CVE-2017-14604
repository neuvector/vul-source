Description:
 GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by
 using the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a
 .desktop file's Name field ends in .pdf but this file's Exec field launches
 a malicious "sh -c" command. In other words, Nautilus provides no UI
 indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktop
 extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly)
 mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to have
 execute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that the
 file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the
 user's answer in the metadata::trusted field.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> fixing this in stable releases would result in the user getting
 mdeslaur> an unexpected "Untrusted application launcher" dialog on existing
 mdeslaur> .desktop files. Dialog changes would also need new translations.
