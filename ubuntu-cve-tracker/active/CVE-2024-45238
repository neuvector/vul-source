Description:
 An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository
 that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a
 resource certificate containing a bit string that doesn't properly decode
 into a Subject Public Key. OpenSSL does not report this problem during
 parsing, and when compiled with OpenSSL libcrypto versions below 3, Fort
 recklessly dereferences the pointer. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party,
 a crash can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead
 to compromised routing.
