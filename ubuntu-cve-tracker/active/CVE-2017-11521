Description:
 The SdpContents::Session::Medium::parse function in
 resip/stack/SdpContents.cxx in reSIProcate 1.10.2 allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering many media
 connections.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Gregor Jasny discovered that reSIProcate incorrectly handled a large
 number of media connections. A remote attacker could exploit by triggering
 many media connections to cause reSIProcate to crash, resulting in a
 denial of service (memory consumption).
