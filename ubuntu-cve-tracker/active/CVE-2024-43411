 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7258-1
Description:
 CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A
 theoretical vulnerability has been identified in CKEditor 4.22 (and above).
 In a highly unlikely scenario where an attacker gains control over the
 https://cke4.ckeditor.com domain, they could potentially execute an attack
 on CKEditor 4 instances. The issue impacts only editor instances with
 enabled version notifications. Please note that this feature is disabled by
 default in all CKEditor 4 LTS versions. Therefore, if you use CKEditor 4
 LTS, it is highly unlikely that you are affected by this vulnerability. If
 you are unsure, please contact us. The fix is available in version
 4.25.0-lts.
