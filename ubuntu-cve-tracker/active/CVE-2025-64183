 https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/blob/b3a19903db0672c63055023aa788e592b16ec3c5/src/wrappers/python/PyOpenEXR_old.cpp#L109-L115
Description:
 OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR
 file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In
 versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.4, 3.3.0 through 3.3.5, and 3.4.0 through 3.4.2,
 there is a use-after-free in PyObject_StealAttrString of pyOpenEXR_old.cpp.
 The legacy adapter defines PyObject_StealAttrString that calls
 PyObject_GetAttrString to obtain a new reference, immediately decrefs it,
 and returns the pointer. Callers then pass this dangling pointer to APIs
 like PyLong_AsLong/PyFloat_AsDouble, resulting in a use-after-free. This is
 invoked in multiple places (e.g., reading PixelType.v, Box2i, V2f, etc.)
 Versions 3.2.5, 3.3.6, and 3.4.3 fix the issue.
