Description:
 In RubyGem excon before 0.71.0, there was a race condition around
 persistent connections, where a connection which is interrupted (such as by
 a timeout) would leave data on the socket. Subsequent requests would then
 read this data, returning content from the previous response. The race
 condition window appears to be short, and it would be difficult to
 purposefully exploit this.
