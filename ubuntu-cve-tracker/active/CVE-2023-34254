Description:
 The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent. Prior to version 1.5, if
 glpi-agent is running remoteinventory task against an Unix platform with
 ssh command, an administrator user on the remote can manage to inject a
 command in a specific workflow the agent would run with the privileges it
 uses. In the case, the agent is running with administration privileges, a
 malicious user could gain high privileges on the computer glpi-agent is
 running on. A malicious user could also disclose all remote accesses the
 agent is configured with for remoteinventory task. This vulnerability has
 been patched in glpi-agent 1.5.
