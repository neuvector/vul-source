Description:
 Spring Framework MVC applications can be vulnerable to a “Path Traversal
 Vulnerability” when deployed on a non-compliant Servlet container.
 
 An application can be vulnerable when all the following are true:
 
   *  the application is deployed as a WAR or with an embedded Servlet
 container
   *  the Servlet container  does not reject suspicious sequences
 https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.1.html#uri-path-canonicalization
 
   *  the application  serves static resources
 https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-config/static-resources.html#page-title
  with Spring resource handling
 
 
 We have verified that applications deployed on Apache Tomcat or Eclipse
 Jetty are not vulnerable, as long as default security features are not
 disabled in the configuration. Because we cannot check exploits against all
 Servlet containers and configuration variants, we strongly recommend
 upgrading your application.
