Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible, where a user's controller is vulnerable to
 template injection. This issue can occur through facts used in the template
 if the user is trying to put templates in multi-line YAML strings and the
 facts being handled do not routinely include special template characters.
 This flaw allows attackers to perform command injection, which discloses
 sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
 confidentiality and integrity.
