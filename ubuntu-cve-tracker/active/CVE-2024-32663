Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to 7.0.5 and 6.0.19, a
 small amount of HTTP/2 traffic can lead to Suricata using a large amount of
 memory. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.5 and 6.0.19.
 Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser and reducing
 `app-layer.protocols.http2.max-table-size` value (default is 65536).
