Description:
 PCI devices with RMRRs not deassigned correctly Certain PCI devices in a
 system might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via Reserved
 Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR"). These are typically used for platform
 tasks such as legacy USB emulation. If such a device is passed through to a
 guest, then on guest shutdown the device is not properly deassigned. The
 IOMMU configuration for these devices which are not properly deassigned
 ends up pointing to a freed data structure, including the IO Pagetables.
 Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device will have unpredictable
 behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption.
