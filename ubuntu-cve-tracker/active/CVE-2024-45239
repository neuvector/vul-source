Description:
 An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository
 that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP)
 an ROA or a Manifest containing a null eContent field. Fort dereferences
 the pointer without sanitizing it first. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying
 Party, a crash can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which
 can lead to compromised routing.
