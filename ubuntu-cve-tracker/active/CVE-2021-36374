Description:
 When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, or a derived formats, an
 Apache Ant build can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that leads
 to an out of memory error, even for small inputs. This can be used to
 disrupt builds using Apache Ant. Commonly used derived formats from ZIP
 archives are for instance JAR files and many office files. Apache Ant prior
 to 1.9.16 and 1.10.11 were affected.
