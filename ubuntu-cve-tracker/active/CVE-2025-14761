Description:
 Missing cryptographic key commitment in the AWS SDK for PHP may allow a
 user with write access to the S3 bucket to introduce a new EDK that
 decrypts to different plaintext when the encrypted data key is stored in an
 "instruction file" instead of S3's metadata record.
 
 To mitigate this issue, upgrade AWS SDK for PHP to version 3.368.0 or later
