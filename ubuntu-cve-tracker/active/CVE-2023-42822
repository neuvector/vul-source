Description:
  xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol server. Access to the font
 glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of this data is
 controllable by the user, this can result in an out-of-bounds read within
 the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds read within
 a potentially privileged process. On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to
 run as root. Potentially an out-of-bounds write can follow the
 out-of-bounds read. There is no denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is
 running in forking mode. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1.
 Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
