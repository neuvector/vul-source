Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting
 (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data
 stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by
 administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's
 browser at view-time. The script under `host.php` is used to monitor and
 manage hosts in the _cacti_ app, hence displays useful information such as
 data queries and verbose logs. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is
 able to configure a data-query template with malicious code appended in the
 template path, in order to deploy a stored XSS attack against any user with
 the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ privileges. A user that
 possesses the _Template Editor>Data Queries_ permissions can configure the
 data query template path in _cacti_. Please note that such a user may be a
 low privileged user. This configuration occurs through
 `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_queries.php` by editing an existing or adding a
 new data query template. If a template is linked to a device then the
 formatted template path will be rendered in the device's management page,
 when a _verbose data query_ is requested. This vulnerability has been
 addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
 update should manually filter HTML output.
