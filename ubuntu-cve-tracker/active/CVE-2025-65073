Description:

 or /v3/s3tokens request with a valid AWS Signature to provide Keystone
 authorization.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Affects: <25.0.1, ==26.0.0, ==27.0.0, ==28.0.0
 mdeslaur> This issue had no CVE number at the time of USN publication.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The heat and swift packages aren't vulnerable to this issue, but
 mdeslaur> they are listed here as they need compatibility fixes to go with
 mdeslaur> the keystone update. Marking priority for them as "negligible"
 mdeslaur> since there is no true security impact to them.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> We will not be fixing this issue in focal and earlier as the fix
 mdeslaur> relies on "Consistent and Secure RBAC" functionnality only
 mdeslaur> available in later releases and requires a newer oslo.policy
 mdeslaur> than what is available in focal.
