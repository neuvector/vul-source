Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Starting with the 7.0 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability in the
 trace view visualization. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due the
 value of a span's attributes/resources were not properly sanitized and this
 will be rendered when the span's attributes/resources are expanded. An
 attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change the value of a
 trace view visualization to contain JavaScript. This means that vertical
 privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change
 to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin
 role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade
 to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.
