Description:
 PDFio is a C library for reading and writing PDF files. In versions prior
 to 1.1.0 a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability exists in the pdfio
 parser. Crafted pdf files can cause the program to run at 100% utilization
 and never terminate. The pdf which causes this crash found in testing is
 about 28kb in size and was discovered via fuzzing. Anyone who uses this
 library either as a standalone binary or as a library can be DOSed when
 attempting to parse this type of file. Web servers or other automated
 processes which rely on this code to turn pdf submissions into plaintext
 can be DOSed when an attacker uploads the pdf. Please see the linked GHSA
 for an example pdf. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
