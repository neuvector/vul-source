Description:
 The request phase of the OmniAuth Ruby gem (1.9.1 and earlier) is
 vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery when used as part of the Ruby on
 Rails framework, allowing accounts to be connected without user intent,
 user interaction, or feedback to the user. This permits a secondary account
 to be able to sign into the web application as the primary account.
