Description:
 Marked prior to version 0.3.17 is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial
 of Service (ReDoS) attack due to catastrophic backtracking in several
 regular expressions used for parsing HTML tags and markdown links. An
 attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted
 markdown input, such as deeply nested or repetitively structured brackets
 or tag attributes, which cause the parser to hang and lead to a Denial of
 Service.
