Description:
 OpenRazer is an open source driver and user-space daemon to control Razer
 device lighting and other features on GNU/Linux. By writing specially
 crafted data to the `matrix_custom_frame` file, an attacker can cause the
 custom kernel driver to read more bytes than provided by user space. This
 data will be written into the RGB arguments which will be sent to the USB
 device. This issue has been patched in v3.10.2.
