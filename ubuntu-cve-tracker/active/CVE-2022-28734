Description:
 Out-of-bounds write when handling split HTTP headers; When handling split
 HTTP headers, GRUB2 HTTP code accidentally moves its internal data buffer
 point by one position. This can lead to a out-of-bound write further when
 parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's
 conceivable that an attacker controlled set of packets can lead to
 corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.
