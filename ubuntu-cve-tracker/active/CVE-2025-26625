Description:
 Git LFS is a Git extension for versioning large files. In Git LFS versions
 0.5.2 through 3.7.0, when populating a Git repository's working tree with
 the contents of Git LFS objects, certain Git LFS commands may write to
 files visible outside the current Git working tree if symbolic or hard
 links exist which collide with the paths of files tracked by Git LFS. The
 git lfs checkout and git lfs pull commands do not check for symbolic links
 before writing to files in the working tree, allowing an attacker to craft
 a repository containing symbolic or hard links that cause Git LFS to write
 to arbitrary file system locations accessible to the user running these
 commands. As well, when the git lfs checkout and git lfs pull commands are
 run in a bare repository, they could write to files visible outside the
 repository. The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.7.1. As a workaround,
 support for symlinks in Git may be disabled by setting the core.symlinks
 configuration option to false, after which further clones and fetches will
 not create symbolic links. However, any symbolic or hard links in existing
 repositories will still provide the opportunity for Git LFS to write to
 their targets.
