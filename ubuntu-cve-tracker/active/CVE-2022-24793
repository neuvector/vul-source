Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C. A buffer overflow vulnerability in versions 2.12 and prior affects
 applications that use PJSIP DNS resolution. It doesn't affect PJSIP users
 who utilize an external resolver. This vulnerability is related to
 CVE-2023-27585. The difference is that this issue is in parsing the query
 record `parse_rr()`, while the issue in CVE-2023-27585 is in
 `parse_query()`. A patch is available in the `master` branch of the
 `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. A workaround is to disable DNS
 resolution in PJSIP config (by setting `nameserver_count` to zero) or use
 an external resolver instead.
