Description:
 SingularityCE and SingularityPRO are open source container platforms. Prior
 to SingularityCE 4.3.5 and SingularityPRO 4.1.11 and 4.3.5, if a user
 relies on LSM restrictions to prevent malicious operations then, under
 certain circumstances, an attacker can redirect the LSM label write
 operation so that it is ineffective. The attacker must cause the user to
 run a malicious container image that redirects the mount of /proc to the
 destination of a shared mount, either known to be configured on the target
 system, or that will be specified by the user when running the container.
 The attacker must also control the content of the shared mount, for example
 through another malicious container which also binds it, or as a user with
 relevant permissions on the host system it is bound from. This
 vulnerability is fixed in SingularityCE 4.3.5 and SingularityPRO 4.1.11 and
 4.3.5.
