Description:
 curl's websocket code did not update the 32 bit mask pattern for each new
  outgoing frame as the specification says. Instead it used a fixed mask
 that
 persisted and was used throughout the entire connection.
 
 A predictable mask pattern allows for a malicious server to induce traffic
 between the two communicating parties that could be interpreted by an
 involved
 proxy (configured or transparent) as genuine, real, HTTP traffic with
 content
 and thereby poison its cache. That cached poisoned content could then be
 served to all users of that proxy.
