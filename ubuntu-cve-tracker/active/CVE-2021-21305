Description:
 CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible
 way to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave before versions
 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The
 "#manipulate!" method inappropriately evals the content of mutation
 option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be
 executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted
 inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is
 fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.
