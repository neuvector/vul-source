 https://metacpan.org/release/RRWO/Net-CIDR-Set-0.14/changes
Description:
 Net::CIDR::Set versions 0.10 through 0.13 for Perl does not properly handle
 leading zero characters in IP CIDR address strings, which could allow
 attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses.
 
 Leading zeros are used to indicate octal numbers, which can confuse users
 who are intentionally using octal notation, as well as users who believe
 they are using decimal notation.
 
 Net::CIDR::Set used code from Net::CIDR::Lite, which had a similar
 vulnerability CVE-2021-47154.
