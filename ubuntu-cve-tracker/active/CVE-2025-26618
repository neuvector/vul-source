Description:
 Erlang is a programming language and runtime system for building massively
 scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. OTP
 is a set of Erlang libraries, which consists of the Erlang runtime system,
 a number of ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang. Packet size
 is not verified properly for SFTP packets. As a result when multiple SSH
 packets (conforming to max SSH packet size) are received by ssh, they might
 be combined into an SFTP packet which will exceed the max allowed packet
 size and potentially cause large amount of memory to be allocated. Note
 that situation described above can only happen for successfully
 authenticated users after completing the SSH handshake. This issue has been
 patched in OTP versions 27.2.4, 26.2.5.9, and 25.3.2.18. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
