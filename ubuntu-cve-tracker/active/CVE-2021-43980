Description:
 The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced in
 Tomcat 10 and back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long standing
 (but extremely hard to trigger) concurrency bug in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0 to
 10.1.0-M12, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.18, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.60 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.77
 that could cause client connections to share an Http11Processor instance
 resulting in responses, or part responses, to be received by the wrong
 client.
