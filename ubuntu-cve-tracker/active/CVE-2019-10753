Description:
 In all versions prior to version 3.9.6 for eclipse-wtp, all versions prior
 to version 9.4.4 for eclipse-cdt, and all versions prior to version 3.0.1
 for eclipse-groovy, Spotless was resolving dependencies over an insecure
 channel (http). If the build occurred over an insecure connection, a
 malicious user could have perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the
 build and alter the build artifacts that were produced. In case that any of
 these artifacts were compromised, any developers using these could be
 altered. **Note:** In order to validate that this artifact was not
 compromised, the maintainer would need to confirm that none of the
 artifacts published to the registry were not altered with. Until this
 happens, we can not guarantee that this artifact was not compromised even
 though the probability that this happened is low.
