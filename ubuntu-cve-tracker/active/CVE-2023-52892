Description:
 In phpseclib before 1.0.22, 2.x before 2.0.46, and 3.x before 3.0.33, some
 characters in Subject Alternative Name fields in TLS certificates are
 incorrectly allowed to have a special meaning in regular expressions (such
 as a + wildcard), leading to name confusion in X.509 certificate host
 verification.
