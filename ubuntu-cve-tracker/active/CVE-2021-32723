Description:
 Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Some languages before 1.24.0 are
 vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is
 used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a
 string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem has
 been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to
 highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used
 to highlight untrusted text.
