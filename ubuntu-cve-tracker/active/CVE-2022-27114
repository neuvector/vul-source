Description:
 There is a vulnerability in htmldoc 1.9.16. In image_load_jpeg function
 image.cxx when it calls malloc,'img->width' and 'img->height' they are
 large enough to cause an integer overflow. So, the malloc function may
 return a heap blosmaller than the expected size, and it will cause a buffer
 overflow/Address boundary error in the jpeg_read_scanlines function.
