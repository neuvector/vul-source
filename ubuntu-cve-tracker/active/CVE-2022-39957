Description:
 The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body
 bypass. A client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing an
 optional "charset" parameter in order to receive the response in an encoded
 form. Depending on the "charset", this response can not be decoded by the
 web application firewall. A restricted resource, access to which would
 ordinarily be detected, may therefore bypass detection. The legacy CRS
 versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported
 versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to
 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.
