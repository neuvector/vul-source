Description:
 An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions
 starting from 14.3 before 15.6.7, all versions starting from 15.7 before
 15.7.6, all versions starting from 15.8 before 15.8.1. An attacker may
 upload a crafted CI job artifact zip file in a project that uses dynamic
 child pipelines and make a sidekiq job allocate a lot of memory. In GitLab
 instances where Sidekiq is memory-limited, this may cause Denial of
