Description:
 Mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that uses
 Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify
 complex diagrams. Prior to version 8.13.8, malicious diagrams can run
 javascript code at diagram readers' machines. Users should upgrade to
 version 8.13.8 to receive a patch. There are no known workarounds aside
 from upgrading.
