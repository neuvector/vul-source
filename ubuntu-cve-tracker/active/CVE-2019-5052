Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX
 file in SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer
 overflow, resulting in too little memory being allocated, which can lead to
 a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a
 specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability.
