Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX
 file in SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer
 overflow, resulting in too little memory being allocated, which can lead to
 a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a
 specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 USN-4238-1 addressed serveral vulnerabilities in SDL_image. This update
 provides the corresponding fixes for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.
