Description:
 An integer overflow can be triggered in SQLiteâ€™s `concat_ws()` function.
 The resulting, truncated integer is then used to allocate a buffer. When
 SQLite then writes the resulting string to the buffer, it uses the
 original, untruncated size and thus a wild Heap Buffer overflow of size
 ~4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary code execution.
