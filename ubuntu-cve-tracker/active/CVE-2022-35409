Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.1 and 3.x before 3.2.0. In
 some configurations, an unauthenticated attacker can send an invalid
 ClientHello message to a DTLS server that causes a heap-based buffer
 over-read of up to 255 bytes. This can cause a server crash or possibly
 information disclosure based on error responses. Affected configurations
 have MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE enabled and
 MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN less than a threshold that depends on the
 configuration: 258 bytes if using mbedtls_ssl_cookie_check, and possibly up
 to 571 bytes with a custom cookie check function.
