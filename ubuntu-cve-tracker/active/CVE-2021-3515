Description:
 A shell injection flaw was found in pglogical in versions before 2.3.4 and
 before 3.6.26. An attacker with CREATEDB privileges on a PostgreSQL server
 can craft a database name that allows execution of shell commands as the
 postgresql user when calling pglogical.create_subscription().
