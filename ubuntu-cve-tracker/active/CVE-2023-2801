Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Using
 public dashboards users can query multiple distinct data sources using
 mixed queries. However such query has a possibility of crashing a Grafana
 instance. The only feature that uses mixed queries at the moment is public
 dashboards, but it's also possible to cause this by calling the query API
 directly. This might enable malicious users to crash Grafana instances
 through that endpoint. Users may upgrade to version 9.4.12 and 9.5.3 to
 receive a fix.
