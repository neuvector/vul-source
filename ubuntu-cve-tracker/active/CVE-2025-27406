Description:
 Icinga Reporting is the central component for reporting related
 functionality in the monitoring web frontend and framework Icinga Web 2. A
 vulnerability present in versions 0.10.0 through 1.0.2 allows to set up a
 template that allows to embed arbitrary Javascript. This enables the
 attacker to act on behalf of the user, if the template is being previewed;
 and act on behalf of the headless browser, if a report using the template
 is printed to PDF. This issue has been resolved in version 1.0.3 of Icinga
 Reporting. As a workaround, review all templates and remove suspicious
 settings.
