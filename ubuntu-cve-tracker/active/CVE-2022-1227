Description:
 A privilege escalation flaw was found in Podman. This flaw allows an
 attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry. Once this image
 is downloaded by a potential victim, the vulnerability is triggered after a
 user runs the 'podman top' command. This action gives the attacker access
 to the host filesystem, leading to information disclosure or denial of
 service.
