Description:
 In Apache Solr versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.5 and 6.0.0 to 6.6.5, the Config API
 allows to configure the JMX server via an HTTP POST request. By pointing it
 to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage of Solr's
 unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the Solr side.
