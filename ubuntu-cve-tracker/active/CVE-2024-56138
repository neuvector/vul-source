Description:
 notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI
 artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was
 identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature. During the
 timestamp signature generation, the revocation status of the certificate(s)
 used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp
 signature generation, notation-go did not check the revocation status of
 the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a
 vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack.
 An attacker could potentially use a compromised, intermediate, or revoked
 leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature, which would then
 be accepted and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service
 scenarios, particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification
 processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a
 revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations. This issue has
 been addressed in release version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to
 upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
