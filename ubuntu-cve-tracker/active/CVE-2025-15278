Description:
 FontForge GUtils XBM File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of FontForge. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of pixels within XBM files. The
 issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
 which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An
 attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of
 the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-27865.
