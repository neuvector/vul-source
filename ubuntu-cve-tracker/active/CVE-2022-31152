Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
 Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix specification specifies a list of [event
 authorization
 rules](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/rooms/v9/#authorization-rules) which
 must be checked when determining if an event should be accepted into a
 room. In versions of Synapse up to and including version 1.61.0, some of
 these rules are not correctly applied. An attacker could craft events which
 would be accepted by Synapse but not a spec-conformant server, potentially
 causing divergence in the room state between servers. Administrators of
 homeservers with federation enabled are advised to upgrade to version
 1.62.0 or higher. Federation can be disabled by setting
 [`federation_domain_whitelist`](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#federation_domain_whitelist)
 to an empty list (`[]`) as a workaround.
