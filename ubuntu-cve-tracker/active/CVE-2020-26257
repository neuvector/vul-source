Description:
 Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP.
 Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix. A malicious
 or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by
 specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`,
 `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This
 can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be
 correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any server
 which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. The Matrix
 Synapse reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation
 is vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1.
 As a workaround homeserver administrators could limit access to the
 federation API to trusted servers (for example via
 `federation_domain_whitelist`).
