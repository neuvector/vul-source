Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting
 (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in
 the cacti's database. These data will be viewed by administrative cacti
 accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time.
 The script under `data_debug.php` displays data source related debugging
 information such as _data source paths, polling settings, meta-data on the
 data source_. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a
 malicious data-source path, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user
 that has privileges related to viewing the `data_debug.php` information. A
 user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_
 permissions can configure the data source path in _cacti_. This
 configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This
 vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to
 upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.
