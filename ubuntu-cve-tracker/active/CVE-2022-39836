 https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-daemon/commit/855e0017a980d2990c16f7dbf3b4983b48fac272 (v2.18.9-alpha)
Description:
 An issue was discovered in Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance (COVESA)
 dlt-daemon through 2.18.8. Due to a faulty DLT file parser, a crafted DLT
 file that crashes the process can be created. This is due to missing
 validation checks. There is a heap-based buffer over-read of one byte.
