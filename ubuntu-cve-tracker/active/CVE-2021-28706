Description:
 guests may exceed their designated memory limit When a guest is permitted
 to have close to 16TiB of memory, it may be able to issue hypercalls to
 increase its memory allocation beyond the administrator established limit.
 This is a result of a calculation done with 32-bit precision, which may
 overflow. It would then only be the overflowed (and hence small) number
 which gets compared against the established upper bound.
