Description:
 A heap out of bounds read vulnerability exists in the handling of IPTC data
 while parsing TIFF images in OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted
 TIFF file can cause a read of adjacent heap memory, which can leak
 sensitive process information. An attacker can provide a malicious file to
 trigger this vulnerability.
