Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue in Wireshark before 4.2.0 allows a remote attacker
 to cause a denial of service via the packet-bgp.c,
 dissect_bgp_open(tvbuff_t*tvb, proto_tree*tree, packet_info*pinfo), optlen
 components. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because neither release
 4.2.0 nor any other release was affected.
