Description:
 An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the
 way SSH packets with a padding length value greater than the packet length
 are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to
 cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled padding value in SSH
 packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a
 denial of service or obtain sensitive information.
