Description:
 A use-after-free vulnerability has been identified in the GNU GRUB (Grand
 Unified Bootloader). The flaw occurs because the file-closing process
 incorrectly retains a memory pointer, leaving an invalid reference to a
 file system structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
 cause grub to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Possible data
 integrity or confidentiality compromise is not discarded.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
