Description:
 A Cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in
 ipa/session/login_password in all supported versions of IPA. This flaw
 allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could
 perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and
 system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that
 for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to
 implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie
 representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go
 through a new authentication attempt.
