Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xpdf 4.00. XRef::readXRefStream in XRef.cc
 allows attackers to launch a denial of service (Integer Overflow) via a
 crafted /Size value in a pdf file, as demonstrated by pdftohtml. This is
 mainly caused by the program attempting a malloc operation for a large
 amount of memory.
