 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7002-1
Description:
 A vulnerability in the package_index module of pypa/setuptools versions up
 to 69.1.1 allows for remote code execution via its download functions.
 These functions, which are used to download packages from URLs provided by
 users or retrieved from package index servers, are susceptible to code
 injection. If these functions are exposed to user-controlled inputs, such
 as package URLs, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. The
 issue is fixed in version 70.0.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-setuptools binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-setuptools, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is
 mdeslaur> required. On jammy and later, python-setuptools is bundled in
 mdeslaur> the python-pip package and needs to be patched.
