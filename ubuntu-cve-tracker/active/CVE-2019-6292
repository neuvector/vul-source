Description:
 An issue was discovered in singledocparser.cpp in yaml-cpp (aka
 LibYaml-C++) 0.6.2. Stack Exhaustion occurs in YAML::SingleDocParser, and
 there is a stack consumption problem caused by recursive stack frames:
 HandleCompactMap, HandleMap, HandleFlowSequence, HandleSequence,
 HandleNode. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a
 denial-of-service via a cpp file.
