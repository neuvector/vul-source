Description:
 A flaw was found in the RPC library APIs of libvirt. The RPC server
 deserialization code allocates memory for arrays before the non-negative
 length check is performed by the C API entry points. Passing a negative
 length to the g_new0 function results in a crash due to the negative length
 being treated as a huge positive number. This flaw allows a local,
 unprivileged user to perform a denial of service attack by causing the
 libvirt daemon to crash.
