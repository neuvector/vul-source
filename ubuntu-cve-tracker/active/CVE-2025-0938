Description:
 The Python standard library functions `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and
 `urlparse` accepted domain names that included square brackets which isn't
 valid according to RFC 3986. Square brackets are only meant to be used as
 delimiters for specifying IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts in URLs. This could
 result in differential parsing across the Python URL parser and other
 specification-compliant URL parsers.
