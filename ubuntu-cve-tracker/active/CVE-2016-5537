Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the NetBeans component in Oracle Fusion
 Middleware 8.1 allows local users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and
 availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information is from
 the October 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that
 this issue is a directory traversal vulnerability which allows local users
 with certain permissions to write to arbitrary files and consequently gain
 privileges via a .. (dot dot) in a archive entry in a ZIP file imported as
 a project.
