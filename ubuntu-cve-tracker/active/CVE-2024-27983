Description:
 An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server completely unavailable by
 sending a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames
 inside. It is possible to leave some data in nghttp2 memory after reset
 when headers with HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame are sent to the server and then
 a TCP connection is abruptly closed by the client triggering the
 Http2Session destructor while header frames are still being processed (and
 stored in memory) causing a race condition.
