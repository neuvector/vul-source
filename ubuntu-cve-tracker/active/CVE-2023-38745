Description:
 Pandoc before 3.1.6 allows arbitrary file write: this can be triggered by
 providing a crafted image element in the input when generating files via
 the --extract-media option or outputting to PDF format. This allows an
 attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files, depending on the
 privileges of the process running Pandoc. It only affects systems that pass
 untrusted user input to Pandoc and allow Pandoc to be used to produce a PDF
 or with the --extract-media option. NOTE: this issue exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2023-35936 (failure to properly account for double
 encoded path names).
