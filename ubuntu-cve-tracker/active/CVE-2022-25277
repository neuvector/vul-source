Description:
 Drupal core sanitizes filenames with dangerous extensions upon upload
 (reference: SA-CORE-2020-012) and strips leading and trailing dots from
 filenames to prevent uploading server configuration files (reference:
 SA-CORE-2019-010). However, the protections for these two vulnerabilities
 previously did not work correctly together. As a result, if the site were
 configured to allow the upload of files with an htaccess extension, these
 files' filenames would not be properly sanitized. This could allow
 bypassing the protections provided by Drupal core's default .htaccess files
 and possible remote code execution on Apache web servers. This issue is
 mitigated by the fact that it requires a field administrator to explicitly
 configure a file field to allow htaccess as an extension (a restricted
 permission), or a contributed module or custom code that overrides allowed
 file uploads.
