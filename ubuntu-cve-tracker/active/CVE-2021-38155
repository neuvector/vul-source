Description:
 OpenStack Keystone 10.x through 16.x before 16.0.2, 17.x before 17.0.1,
 18.x before 18.0.1, and 19.x before 19.0.1 allows information disclosure
 during account locking (related to PCI DSS features). By guessing the name
 of an account and failing to authenticate multiple times, any
 unauthenticated actor could both confirm the account exists and obtain that
 account's corresponding UUID, which might be leveraged for other unrelated
 attacks. All deployments enabling
 security_compliance.lockout_failure_attempts are affected.
