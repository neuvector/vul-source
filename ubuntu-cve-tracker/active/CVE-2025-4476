Description:
 A denial-of-service vulnerability has been identified in the libsoup HTTP
 client library. This flaw can be triggered when a libsoup client receives a
 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP response containing a specifically crafted domain
 parameter within the WWW-Authenticate header. Processing this malformed
 header can lead to a crash of the client application using libsoup. An
 attacker could exploit this by setting up a malicious HTTP server. If a
 user's application using the vulnerable libsoup library connects to this
 malicious server, it could result in a denial-of-service. Successful
 exploitation requires tricking a user's client application into connecting
 to the attacker's malicious server.
