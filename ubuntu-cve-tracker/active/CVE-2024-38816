Description:
 Applications serving static resources through the functional web frameworks
 WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn are vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An
 attacker can craft malicious HTTP requests and obtain any file on the file
 system that is also accessible to the process in which the Spring
 application is running.
 
 Specifically, an application is vulnerable when both of the following are
 true:
 
   *  the web application uses RouterFunctions to serve static resources
   *  resource handling is explicitly configured with a
 FileSystemResource location
 
 
 However, malicious requests are blocked and rejected when any of the
 following is true:
 
   *  the  Spring Security HTTP Firewall
 https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/firewall.html
  is in use
   *  the application runs on Tomcat or Jetty
