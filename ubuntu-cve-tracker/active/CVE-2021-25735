Description:
 A security issue was discovered in kube-apiserver that could allow node
 updates to bypass a Validating Admission Webhook. Clusters are only
 affected by this vulnerability if they run a Validating Admission Webhook
 for Nodes that denies admission based at least partially on the old state
 of the Node object. Validating Admission Webhook does not observe some
 previous fields.
