 https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/releases/tag/v7.2.4
Description:
 Sidekiq is simple, efficient background processing for Ruby. Sidekiq is
 reflected XSS vulnerability. The value of substr parameter is reflected in
 the response without any encoding, allowing an attacker to inject
 Javascript code into the response of the application. An attacker could
 exploit it to target users of the Sidekiq Web UI. Moreover, if other
 applications are deployed on the same domain or website as Sidekiq, users
 of those applications could also be affected, leading to a broader scope of
 compromise. Potentially compromising their accounts, forcing the users to
 perform sensitive actions, stealing sensitive data, performing CORS
 attacks, defacement of the web application, etc. This issue has been
 patched in version 7.2.4.
