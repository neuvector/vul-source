Description:
 A flaw was found in Python, specifically in the FTP (File Transfer
 Protocol) client library in PASV (passive) mode. The issue is how the FTP
 client trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw allows
 an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick FTP clients
 into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This vulnerability
 could lead to FTP client scanning ports, which otherwise would not have
 been possible.
