Description:
 Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language.
 Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can
 have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or
 `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for
 example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector
 for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git
 via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist
 does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be
 affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with
 arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge
 this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on
 packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability
 report.
