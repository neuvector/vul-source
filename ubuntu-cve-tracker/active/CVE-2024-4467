Description:
 A flaw was found in the QEMU disk image utility (qemu-img) 'info' command.
 A specially crafted image file containing a `json:{}` value describing
 block devices in QMP could cause the qemu-img process on the host to
 consume large amounts of memory or CPU time, leading to denial of service
 or read/write to an existing external file.
