Description:
 The Elliptic package 6.5.7 for Node.js, in its for ECDSA implementation,
 does not correctly verify valid signatures if the hash contains at least
 four leading 0 bytes and when the order of the elliptic curve's base point
 is smaller than the hash, because of an _truncateToN anomaly. This leads to
 valid signatures being rejected. Legitimate transactions or communications
 may be incorrectly flagged as invalid.
