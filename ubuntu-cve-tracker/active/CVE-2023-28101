Description:
 Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
 desktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4,
 and 1.15.4, if an attacker publishes a Flatpak app with elevated
 permissions, they can hide those permissions from users of the `flatpak(1)`
 command-line interface by setting other permissions to crafted values that
 contain non-printable control characters such as `ESC`. A fix is available
 in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, use a GUI
 like GNOME Software rather than the command-line interface, or only install
 apps whose maintainers you trust.
