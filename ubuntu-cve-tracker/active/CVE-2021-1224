Description:
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability with TCP Fast Open
 (TFO) when used in conjunction with the Snort detection engine that could
 allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file
 policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the
 HTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the TFO
 connection handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
 sending crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected
 device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured
 file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.
