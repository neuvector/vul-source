Description:
 redis-py before 4.5.3 leaves a connection open after canceling an async
 Redis command at an inopportune time, and can send response data to the
 client of an unrelated request in an off-by-one manner. NOTE: this CVE
 Record was initially created in response to reports about ChatGPT, and
 4.3.6, 4.4.3, and 4.5.3 were released (changing the behavior for pipeline
 operations); however, please see CVE-2023-28859 about addressing data
 leakage across AsyncIO connections in general.
