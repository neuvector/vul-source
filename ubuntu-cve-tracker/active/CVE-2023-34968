Description:
 A path disclosure vulnerability was found in Samba. As part of the
 Spotlight protocol, Samba discloses the server-side absolute path of
 shares, files, and directories in the results for search queries. This flaw
 allows a malicious client or an attacker with a targeted RPC request to
 view the information that is part of the disclosed path.
