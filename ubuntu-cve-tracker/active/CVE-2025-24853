Description:
 A carefully crafted request when creating a header link using the
 wiki markup syntax, which could allow the attacker to execute javascript
  in the victim's browser and get some sensitive information about the
 victim.
 
 
 
 Further research by the JSPWiki team showed that the markdown parser
 allowed this kind of attack too.
 
 Apache JSPWiki users should upgrade to 2.12.3 or later.
