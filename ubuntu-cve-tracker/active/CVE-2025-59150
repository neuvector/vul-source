Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Version
 8.0.0's usage of the tls.subjectaltname keyword can lead to a segmentation
 fault when the decoded subjectaltname contains a NULL byte. This issue is
 fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, disable rules using the
 tls.subjectaltname keyword.
