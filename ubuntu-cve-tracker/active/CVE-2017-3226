Description:
 Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an
 AES encrypted file. Devices that make use of Das U-Boot's AES-CBC
 encryption feature using environment encryption (i.e., setting the
 configuration parameter CONFIG_ENV_AES=y) read environment variables from
 disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with physical
 access to the device can manipulate the encrypted environment data to
 include a crafted two-byte sequence which triggers an error in environment
 variable parsing. This error condition is improperly handled by Das U-Boot,
 resulting in an immediate process termination with a debugging message.

 mdeslaur> xenial doesn't build with ENV_AES, and later releases removed
