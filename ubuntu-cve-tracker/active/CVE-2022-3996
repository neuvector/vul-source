Description:
 If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy
 processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively.
 On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial
 of service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled
 on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup. Policy
 processing is enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line
 utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.
 Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement
 was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.
