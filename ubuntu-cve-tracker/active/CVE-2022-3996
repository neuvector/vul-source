Description:
 If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
 policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
 recursively.  On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
 results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.  Policy
 processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered
 to be a common setup.
 
 Policy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy'
 argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
 `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.
 
 Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement
 was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.
