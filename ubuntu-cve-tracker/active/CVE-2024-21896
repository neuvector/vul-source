Description:
 The permission model protects itself against path traversal attacks by
 calling path.resolve() on any paths given by the user. If the path is to be
 treated as a Buffer, the implementation uses Buffer.from() to obtain a
 Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). By monkey-patching Buffer
 internals, namely, Buffer.prototype.utf8Write, the application can modify
 the result of path.resolve(), which leads to a path traversal
 vulnerability. This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental
 permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21. Please note that at the time
 this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of
 Node.js.
