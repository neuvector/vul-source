Description:
 Jupyter Core is a package for the core common functionality of Jupyter
 projects. When using Jupyter Core prior to version 5.8.0 on Windows, the
 shared `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory is searched for configuration files
 (`SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` and `SYSTEM_JUPYTER_PATH`), which may allow users to
 create configuration files affecting other users. Only shared Windows
 systems with multiple users and unprotected `%PROGRAMDATA%` are affected.
 Users should upgrade to Jupyter Core version 5.8.0 or later to receive a
 patch. Some other mitigations are available. As administrator, modify the
 permissions on the `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory so it is not writable by
 unauthorized users; or as administrator, create the `%PROGRAMDATA%\jupyter`
 directory with appropriately restrictive permissions; or as user or
 administrator, set the `%PROGRAMDATA%` environment variable to a directory
 with appropriately restrictive permissions (e.g. controlled by
 administrators _or_ the current user).
