Description:
 An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository
 that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a
 resource certificate containing a Key Usage extension composed of more than
 two bytes of data. Fort writes this string into a 2-byte buffer without
 properly sanitizing its length, leading to a buffer overflow.
