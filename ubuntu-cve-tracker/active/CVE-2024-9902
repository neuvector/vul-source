Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible. The ansible-core `user` module can allow an
 unprivileged user to silently create or replace the contents of any file on
 any system path and take ownership of it when a privileged user executes
 the `user` module against the unprivileged user's home directory. If the
 unprivileged user has traversal permissions on the directory containing the
 exploited target file, they retain full control over the contents of the
 file as its owner.
