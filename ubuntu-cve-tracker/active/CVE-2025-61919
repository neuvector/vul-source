Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.20,
 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, `Rack::Request#POST` reads the entire request body into
 memory for `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, calling
 `rack.input.read(nil)` without enforcing a length or cap. Large request
 bodies can therefore be buffered completely into process memory before
 parsing, leading to denial of service (DoS) through memory exhaustion.
 Users should upgrade to Rack version 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, anu of which
 enforces form parameter limits using `query_parser.bytesize_limit`,
 preventing unbounded reads of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies.
 Additionally, enforce strict maximum body size at the proxy or web server
 layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`, Apache `LimitRequestBody`).
