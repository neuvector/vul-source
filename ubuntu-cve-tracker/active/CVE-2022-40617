Description:
 strongSwan before 5.9.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service in the revocation plugin by sending a crafted end-entity (and
 intermediate CA) certificate that contains a CRL/OCSP URL that points to a
 server (under the attacker's control) that doesn't properly respond but
 (for example) just does nothing after the initial TCP handshake, or sends
 an excessive amount of application data.
