Description:
 Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
 matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant
 Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.33.2 "Push rules" can
 specify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`,
 which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certain
 patterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to
 a denial-of-service when processing moderate length events. The issue is
 patched in version 1.33.2. A potential workaround might be to prevent users
 from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at a
 reverse-proxy.
