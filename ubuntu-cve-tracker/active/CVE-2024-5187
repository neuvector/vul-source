Description:
 A vulnerability in the `download_model_with_test_data` function of the
 onnx/onnx framework, version 1.16.0, allows for arbitrary file overwrite
 due to inadequate prevention of path traversal attacks in malicious tar
 files. This vulnerability enables attackers to overwrite any file on the
 system, potentially leading to remote code execution, deletion of system,
 personal, or application files, thus impacting the integrity and
 availability of the system. The issue arises from the function's handling
 of tar file extraction without performing security checks on the paths
 within the tar file, as demonstrated by the ability to overwrite the
 `/home/kali/.ssh/authorized_keys` file by specifying an absolute path in
 the malicious tar file.
