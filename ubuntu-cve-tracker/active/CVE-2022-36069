Description:
 Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that
 come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various
 commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user
 input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry
 correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of
 arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility
 that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an
 optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code
 Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged
 to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker
 could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on
 a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal
 systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user
 interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However,
 it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way
 they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries
 to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config
 files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1
 contain patches for this issue.
