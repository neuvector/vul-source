Description:
 A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from
 a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(), which is the
 forwarded query that matches the reply, by only using a weak hash of the
 query name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled without
 DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) this flaw allows an off-path attacker to find
 several different domains all having the same hash, substantially reducing
 the number of attempts they would have to perform to forge a reply and get
 it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifies
 that the query name is one of the attributes of a query that must be used
 to match a reply. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache
 Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a
 successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
 to data integrity.
