Description:
 Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Drupal Core allows
 Object Injection.This issue affects Drupal Core: from 8.0.0 before 10.2.11,
 from 10.3.0 before 10.3.9, from 11.0.0 before 11.0.8.
 
 Drupal core contains a chain of methods that is exploitable when an
 insecure deserialization vulnerability exists on the site. This so called
 gadget chain presents no direct threat, but is a vector that can be used to
 achieve remote code execution if the application deserializes untrusted
 data due to another vulnerability.
