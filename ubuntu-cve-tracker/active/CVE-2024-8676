Description:
 A vulnerability was found in CRI-O, where it can be requested to take a
 checkpoint archive of a container and later be asked to restore it. When it
 does that restoration, it attempts to restore the mounts from the restore
 archive instead of the pod request. As a result, the validations run on the
 pod spec, verifying that the pod has access to the mounts it specifies are
 not applicable to a restored container. This flaw allows a malicious user
 to trick CRI-O into restoring a pod that doesn't have access to host
 mounts. The user needs access to the kubelet or cri-o socket to call the
 restore endpoint and trigger the restore.
