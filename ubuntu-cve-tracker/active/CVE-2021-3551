Description:
 A flaw was found in the PKI-server, where the spkispawn command, when run
 in debug mode, stores admin credentials in the installation log file. This
 flaw allows a local attacker to retrieve the file to obtain the admin
 password and gain admin privileges to the Dogtag CA manager. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
