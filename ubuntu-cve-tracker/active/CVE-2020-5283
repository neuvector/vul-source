Description:
 ViewVC before versions 1.1.28 and 1.2.1 has a XSS vulnerability in CVS
 show_subdir_lastmod support. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated
 by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a CVS repository
 exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance that also has the
 `show_subdir_lastmod` feature enabled. The attack vector involves files
 with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would
 cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be
 challenging to create. This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.2.1 and
 1.1.28.
