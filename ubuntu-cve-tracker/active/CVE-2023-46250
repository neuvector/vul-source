Description:
 pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. An attacker who
 uses a vulnerability present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can craft a
 PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current
 process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not
 affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user
 manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF
 or by adding annotations. The issue was fixed in version 3.17.0. As a
 workaround, apply the patch manually by modifying
 `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`.
