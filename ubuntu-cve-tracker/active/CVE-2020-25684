Description:
 A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from
 a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in the forward.c:reply_query() if the
 reply destination address/port is used by the pending forwarded queries.
 However, it does not use the address/port to retrieve the exact forwarded
 query, substantially reducing the number of attempts an attacker on the
 network would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by
 dnsmasq. This issue contrasts with RFC5452, which specifies a query's
 attributes that all must be used to match a reply. This flaw allows an
 attacker to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained with
 CVE-2020-25685 or CVE-2020-25686, the attack complexity of a successful
 attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
 integrity.
