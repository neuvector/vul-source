Description:
 The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (Speculative
 Return Stack Overflow) are not IRQ-safe.  It was believed that the
 mitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled.
 
 However, the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left
 interrupts enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one
 conditionally on whether XPTI was active.
 
 As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU vendors, the mitigations
 are not active together by default.  Therefore, there is a race
 condition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protections
 and launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.
