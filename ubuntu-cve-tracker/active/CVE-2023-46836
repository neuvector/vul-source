Description:
 The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (Speculative
 Return Stack Overflow) are not IRQ-safe. It was believed that the
 mitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled. However, the
 original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left interrupts
 enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one conditionally on
 whether XPTI was active. As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU
 vendors, the mitigations are not active together by default. Therefore,
 there is a race condition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO
 protections and launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.
