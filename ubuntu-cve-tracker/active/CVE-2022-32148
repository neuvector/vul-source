Description:
 Improper exposure of client IP addresses in net/http before Go 1.17.12 and
 Go 1.18.4 can be triggered by calling httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP with
 a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header,
 which causes ReverseProxy to set the client IP as the value of the
 X-Forwarded-For header.
