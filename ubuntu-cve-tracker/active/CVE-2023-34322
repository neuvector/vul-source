Description:
 For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (see
 XSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode. Since Xen itself
 needs to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests run
 directly the respective shadow page tables. For 64-bit PV guests this means
 running on the shadow of the guest root page table. In the course of
 dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool associated with a
 domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down. This tearing down may
 include the shadow root page table that the CPU in question is presently
 running on. While a precaution exists to supposedly prevent the tearing
 down of the underlying live page table, the time window covered by that
 precaution isn't large enough.
