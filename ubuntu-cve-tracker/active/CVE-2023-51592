Description:
 BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP parse_media_folder Out-Of-Bounds Read Information
 Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent
 attackers to disclose sensitive information via Bluetooth on affected
 installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this
 vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious device. The
 specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can
 result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can
 leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute
 arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20854.
