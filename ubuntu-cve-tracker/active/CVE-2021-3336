Description:
 DoTls13CertificateVerify in tls13.c in wolfSSL before 4.7.0 does not cease
 processing for certain anomalous peer behavior (sending an ED22519, ED448,
 ECC, or RSA signature without the corresponding certificate). The client
 side is affected because man-in-the-middle attackers can impersonate TLS
 1.3 servers.
