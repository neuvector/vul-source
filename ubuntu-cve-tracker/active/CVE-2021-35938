Description:
 A symbolic link issue was found in rpm. It occurs when rpm sets the desired
 permissions and credentials after installing a file. A local unprivileged
 user could use this flaw to exchange the original file with a symbolic link
 to a security-critical file and escalate their privileges on the system.
 The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and
 integrity as well as system availability.
