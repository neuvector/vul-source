Description:
 ClickHouseÂ® is an open-source column-oriented database management system
 that allows generating analytical data reports in real-time. A heap buffer
 overflow issue was discovered in ClickHouse server. An attacker could send
 a specially crafted payload to the native interface exposed by default on
 port 9000/tcp, triggering a bug in the decompression logic of T64 codec
 that crashes the ClickHouse server process. This attack does not require
 authentication. Note that this exploit can also be triggered via HTTP
 protocol, however, the attacker will need a valid credential as the HTTP
 authentication take places first. This issue has been fixed in version
 23.10.2.13-stable, 23.9.4.11-stable, 23.8.6.16-lts and 23.3.16.7-lts.
