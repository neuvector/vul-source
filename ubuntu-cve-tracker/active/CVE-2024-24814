Description:
 mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certifiedâ„¢ authentication and authorization
 module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect
 Relying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validation
 on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable
 to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been
 conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the
 mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like
 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally
 gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our
 server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make
 the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash
 with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2.
 Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
