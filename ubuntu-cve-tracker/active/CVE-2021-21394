Description:
 Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
 matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant
 Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.28.0 Synapse is missing
 input validation of some parameters on the endpoints used to confirm
 third-party identifiers could cause excessive use of disk space and memory
 leading to resource exhaustion. Note that the groups feature is not part of
 the Matrix specification and the chosen maximum lengths are arbitrary. Not
 all clients might abide by them. Refer to referenced GitHub security
 advisory for additional details including workarounds.
