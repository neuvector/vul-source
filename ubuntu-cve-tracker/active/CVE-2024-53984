Description:
 Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation.  When the
 compile time option PB_ENABLE_MALLOC is enabled, the message contains at
 least one field with FT_POINTER field type, custom stream callback is used
 with unknown stream length. and the pb_decode_ex() function is used with
 flag PB_DECODE_DELIMITED, then the pb_decode_ex() function does not
 automatically call pb_release(), like is done for other failure cases. This
 could lead to memory leak and potential denial-of-service. This
 vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.9.1.
