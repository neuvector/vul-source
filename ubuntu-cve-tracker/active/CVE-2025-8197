Description:
 A global buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the
 soup_header_name_to_string function in Libsoup. The
 `soup_header_name_to_string` function does not validate the `name`
 parameter passed in, and directly accesses
 `soup_header_name_strings[name]`. The value of `name` is controllable, when
 `name` exceeds the index range of `soup_headr_name_string`, it will cause
 an out-of-bounds access.
