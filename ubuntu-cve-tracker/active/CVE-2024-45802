Description:
 Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS,
 FTP, and more. Due to Input Validation, Premature Release of Resource
 During Expected Lifetime, and Missing Release of Resource after Effective
 Lifetime bugs, Squid is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks by a
 trusted server against all clients using the proxy. This bug is fixed in
 the default build configuration of Squid version 6.10.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Upstream have fixed this vulnerability by disabling ESI by
 mdeslaur> default. Ubuntu packages would have to be updated to disable ESI
 mdeslaur> to fix this issue, which would be a breaking change and could
 mdeslaur> possibly be considered a regression in functionality.
 mdeslaur> Debian disabled ESI in 6.12-1
 mdeslaur> Red Hat has disabled ESI in stable releases
