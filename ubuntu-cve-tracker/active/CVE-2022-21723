Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
 STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions 2.11.1 and prior, parsing an incoming SIP
 message that contains a malformed multipart can potentially cause
 out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all PJSIP users that accept
 SIP multipart. The patch is available as commit in the `master` branch.
 There are no known workarounds.
