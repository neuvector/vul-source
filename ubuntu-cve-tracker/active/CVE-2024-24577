Description:
 libgit2 is a portable C implementation of the Git core methods provided as
 a linkable library with a solid API, allowing to build Git functionality
 into your application. Using well-crafted inputs to `git_index_add` can
 cause heap corruption that could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.
 There is an issue in the `has_dir_name` function in `src/libgit2/index.c`,
 which frees an entry that should not be freed. The freed entry is later
 used and overwritten with potentially bad actor-controlled data leading to
 controlled heap corruption. Depending on the application that uses libgit2,
 this could lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue has been patched in
 version 1.6.5 and 1.7.2.
