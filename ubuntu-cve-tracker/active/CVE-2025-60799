Description:
 phpPgAdmin 7.13.0 and earlier contains an incorrect access control
 vulnerability in sql.php at lines 68-76. The application allows
 unauthorized manipulation of session variables by accepting user-controlled
 parameters ('subject', 'server', 'database', 'queryid') without proper
 validation or access control checks. Attackers can exploit this to store
 arbitrary SQL queries in $_SESSION['sqlquery'] by manipulating these
 parameters, potentially leading to session poisoning, stored cross-site
 scripting, or unauthorized access to sensitive session data.
