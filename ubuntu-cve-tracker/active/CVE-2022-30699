Description:
 NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.16.1, is vulnerable to a
 novel type of the "ghost domain names" attack. The vulnerability works by
 targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a rogue domain name
 when the cached delegation information is about to expire. The rogue
 nameserver delays the response so that the cached delegation information is
 expired. Upon receiving the delayed answer containing the delegation
 information, Unbound overwrites the now expired entries. This action can be
 repeated when the delegation information is about to expire making the
 rogue delegation information ever-updating. From version 1.16.2 on, Unbound
 stores the start time for a query and uses that to decide if the cached
 delegation information can be overwritten.
