Description:
 A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker
 to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to
 access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to
 read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original
 process.
 
 A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the
 process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user
 executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted
 data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can
 leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux
 kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the
 /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain
 access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read
 sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data
 confidentiality.
