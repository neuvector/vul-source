Description:
 Improper input validation in the TLS 1.3 CertificateVerify signature
 algorithm negotiation in wolfSSL 5.8.2 and earlier on multiple platforms
 allows for downgrading the signature algorithm used. For example when a
 client sends ECDSA P521 as the supported signature algorithm the server
 previously could respond as ECDSA P256 being the accepted signature
 algorithm and the connection would continue with using ECDSA P256, if the
 client supports ECDSA P256.
