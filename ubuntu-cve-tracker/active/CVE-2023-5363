Description:
 Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
 initialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncation
 or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.
 
 Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
 which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.
 
 When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or
 EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after
 the key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,
 via the "keylen" parameter or the IV length, via the "ivlen" parameter,
 within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
 causing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers
 and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.
 
 For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
 loss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D
 section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
 GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.
 
 Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
 produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
 exception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
 critical.
 
 Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common
 operation
 and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely
 that
 application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
 decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
 vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application
 being
 vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable
 then
 this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed
 this
 issue as Moderate severity overall.
 
 The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.
 
 The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because
 the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.
 
 OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.
