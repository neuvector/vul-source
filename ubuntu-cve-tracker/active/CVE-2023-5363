Description:
 Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
 initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential truncation
 or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers. Impact
 summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which could
 result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes. When calling
 EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the
 provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been
 established. Any alterations to the key length, via the "keylen" parameter
 or the IV length, via the "ivlen" parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array
 will not take effect as intended, potentially causing truncation or
 overreading of these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are
 impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB. For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher
 modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of confidentiality. For
 example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for
 constructing a deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the
 counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both truncations and overruns of
 the key and overruns of the IV will produce incorrect results and could, in
 some cases, trigger a memory exception. However, these issues are not
 currently assessed as security critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths
 is not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable API was
 recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that application developers
 will have spotted this problem during testing since decryption would fail
 unless both peers in the communication were similarly vulnerable. For these
 reasons we expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to
 this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then this
 issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
 issue as Moderate severity overall. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is
 not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not
 affected by this because the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider
 boundary. OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.
