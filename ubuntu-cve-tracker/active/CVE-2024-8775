Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible, where sensitive information stored in Ansible
 Vault files can be exposed in plaintext during the execution of a playbook.
 This occurs when using tasks such as include_vars to load vaulted variables
 without setting the no_log: true parameter, resulting in sensitive data
 being printed in the playbook output or logs. This can lead to the
 unintentional disclosure of secrets like passwords or API keys,
 compromising security and potentially allowing unauthorized access or
 actions.
