Description:
 The fix for CVE-2022-3437 included changing memcmp to be constant time and
 a workaround for a compiler bug by adding "!= 0" comparisons to the result
 of memcmp. When these patches were backported to the heimdal-7.7.1 and
 heimdal-7.8.0 branches (and possibly other branches) a logic inversion
 sneaked in causing the validation of message integrity codes in
 gssapi/arcfour to be inverted.
