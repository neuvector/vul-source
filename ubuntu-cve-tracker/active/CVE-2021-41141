Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
 STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs,
 it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held
 locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of
 service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the
 linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected.
 Users may need to manually apply the patch.
