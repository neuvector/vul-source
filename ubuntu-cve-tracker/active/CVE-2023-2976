 https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2575
Description:
 Use of Java's default temporary directory for file creation in
 `FileBackedOutputStream` in Google Guava versions 1.0 to 31.1 on Unix
 systems and Android Ice Cream Sandwich allows other users and apps on the
 machine with access to the default Java temporary directory to be able to
 access the files created by the class. Even though the security
 vulnerability is fixed in version 32.0.0, we recommend using version 32.0.1
 as version 32.0.0 breaks some functionality under Windows.
