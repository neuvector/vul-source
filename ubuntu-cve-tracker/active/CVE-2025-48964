Description:
 ping in iputils before 20250602 allows a denial of service (application
 error in adaptive ping mode or incorrect data collection) via a crafted
 ICMP Echo Reply packet, because a zero timestamp can lead to large
 intermediate values that have an integer overflow when squared during
 statistics calculations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete
 fix for CVE-2025-47268 (that fix was only about timestamp calculations, and
 it did not account for a specific scenario where the original timestamp in
 the ICMP payload is zero).
