Description:
 efibootguard is a simple UEFI boot loader with support for safely switching
 between current and updated partition sets. Insufficient or missing
 validation and sanitization of input from untrustworthy bootloader
 environment files can cause crashes and probably also code injections into
 `bg_setenv`) or programs using `libebgenv`. This is triggered when the
 affected components try to modify a manipulated environment, in particular
 its user variables. Furthermore, `bg_printenv` may crash over invalid read
 accesses or report invalid results. Not affected by this issue is EFI Boot
 Guard's bootloader EFI binary. EFI Boot Guard release v0.15 contains
 required patches to sanitize and validate the bootloader environment prior
 to processing it in userspace. Its library and tools should be updated, so
 should programs statically linked against it. An update of the bootloader
 EFI executable is not required. The only way to prevent the issue with an
 unpatched EFI Boot Guard version is to avoid accesses to user variables,
 specifically modifications to them.
