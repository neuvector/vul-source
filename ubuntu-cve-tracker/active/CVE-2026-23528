Description:
 Dask distributed is a distributed task scheduler for Dask. Prior to
 2026.1.0, when Jupyter Lab, jupyter-server-proxy, and Dask distributed are
 all run together, it is possible to craft a URL which will result in code
 being executed by Jupyter due to a cross-side-scripting (XSS) bug in the
 Dask dashboard. It is possible for attackers to craft a phishing URL that
 assumes Jupyter Lab and Dask may be running on localhost and using default
 ports. If a user clicks on the malicious link it will open an error page in
 the Dask Dashboard via the Jupyter Lab proxy which will cause code to be
 executed by the default Jupyter Python kernel. This vulnerability is fixed
 in 2026.1.0.
