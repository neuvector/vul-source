Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7,
 missing initialization of the random seed for "thash" leads to datasets
 having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to dataset file
 loading to use excessive time to load, as well as runtime performance
 issues during traffic handling. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. As
 a workaround, avoid loading datasets from untrusted sources. Avoid dataset
 rules that track traffic in rules.
