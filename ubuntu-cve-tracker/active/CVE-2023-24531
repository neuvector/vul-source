Description:
 Command go env is documented as outputting a shell script containing the Go
 environment. However, go env doesn't sanitize values, so executing its
 output as a shell script can cause various bad bahaviors, including
 executing arbitrary commands or inserting new environment variables. This
 issue is relatively minor because, in general, if an attacker can set
 arbitrary environment variables on a system, they have better attack
 vectors than making "go env" print them out.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
 mdeslaur> 
 mdeslaur> Warning: do not include nullboot in the list of no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuilds after fixing an issue in golang.
