Description:
 The salt.auth.pki module does not properly authenticate callers. The
 "password" field contains a public certificate which is validated against a
 CA certificate by the module. This is not pki authentication, as the caller
 does not need access to the corresponding private key for the
 authentication attempt to be accepted.
