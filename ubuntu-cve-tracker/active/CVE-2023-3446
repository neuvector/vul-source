Description:
 Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very
 slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(),
 DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters
 may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being
 checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a
 Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH
 parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter)
 is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL
 will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.
 However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or
 parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied
 modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. An
 application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
 from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.
 The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL
 functions. An application calling any of those other functions may
 similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are
 DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL
 dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check'
 option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.
 The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.
