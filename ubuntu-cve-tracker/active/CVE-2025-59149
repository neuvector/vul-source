Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In version
 8.0.0, rules using keyword ldap.responses.attribute_type (which is long)
 with transforms can lead to a stack buffer overflow during Suricata startup
 or during a rule reload. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To
 workaround this issue, users can disable rules with
 ldap.responses.attribute_type and transforms.
