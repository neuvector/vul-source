Description:
 Waitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and
 only look for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would
 fall through and use the Content-Length header instead. According to the
 HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the
 inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending
 with chunked. Requests sent with: "Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked" would
 incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header
 instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. This could allow
 for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of
 HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.
