Description:
 This affects all versions of package Flask-Security. When using the
 get_post_logout_redirect and get_post_login_redirect functions, it is
 possible to bypass URL validation and redirect a user to an arbitrary URL
 by providing multiple back slashes such as \\\evil.com/path. This
 vulnerability is only exploitable if an alternative WSGI server other than
 Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour of Werkzeug is modified using
 'autocorrect_location_header=False. **Note:** Flask-Security is not
 maintained anymore.
