Description:
 Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes
 it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as
 a consequence.
 
 Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to
 authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by
 removing,
 adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL
 implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.
 
 The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
 data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the
 application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with
 NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.
 The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call
 instead of performing the associated data authentication operation.
 The empty data thus will not be authenticated.
 
 As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and
 we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
 entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.
