Description:
 mingw-w64 version 5.0.4 by default produces executables that opt in to
 ASLR, but are not compatible with ASLR. ASLR is an exploit mitigation
 technique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windows
 executables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the
 "Dynamic base" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windows
 executables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped from
 them by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 are
 vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Windows
 executables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but are
 not. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as a
 result.
