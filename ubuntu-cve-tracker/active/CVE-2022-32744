Description:
 A flaw was found in Samba. The KDC accepts kpasswd requests encrypted with
 any key known to it. By encrypting forged kpasswd requests with its own
 key, a user can change other users' passwords, enabling full domain
 takeover.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> patches for this issue in the bug for CVE-2022-2031
 mdeslaur> Fixing this in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS would require substantial
 mdeslaur> code backports. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu 18.04
 mdeslaur> LTS. In environments where this is of concern, we recommend
 mdeslaur> updating to a more recent Ubuntu version, or disabling kpasswd
 mdeslaur> if this is not passible.
Mitigation: 
 kpasswd is not a critical protocol for the AD DC in most installations, it
 can be disabled by setting "kpasswd port = 0" in the smb.conf.
