Description:
 The JsonErrorReportValve in Apache Tomcat 8.5.83, 9.0.40 to 9.0.68 and
 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.1 did not escape the type, message or description values.
 In some circumstances these are constructed from user provided data and it
 was therefore possible for users to supply values that invalidated or
 manipulated the JSON output.
