Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the yy_get_next_buffer function in Flex
 before 2.6.1 might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving
 num_to_read.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> introduced in 2.5.36 by
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/westes/flex/commit/9ba3187a537d6a58d345f2874d06087fd4050399
 sbeattie> redhat bug claims that it's not exploitable due to followup code
 sbeattie> also, simply replacing yy_size_t with int on num_to_read as
   in the upstream patch causes even more signed comparison warnings in
   flex generated sources; there's a comparison against a size_t
   variable in YY_INPUT for one. The "correct" fix for this likely includes
   the additional commit mentioned in the oss-security post.
 sbeattie> fixing will also require recompiling anything with generated
   code from the versions of flex in vivid through xenial.
