Description:
 OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and
 distribute sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys.
 OpenBao before v2.3.0 may leak sensitive information in logs when
 processing malformed data. This is separate from the earlier HCSEC-2025-09
 / CVE-2025-4166. This issue has been fixed in OpenBao v2.3.0 and later.
 Like with HCSEC-2025-09, there is no known workaround except to ensure
 properly formatted requests from all clients.
