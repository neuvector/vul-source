Description:
 RediSearch is a Redis module that provides querying, secondary indexing,
 and full-text search for Redis. An authenticated redis user executing
 FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE with a specially crafted LIMIT command argument,
 or FT.SEARCH with a specially crafted KNN command argument, can trigger an
 integer overflow, leading to heap overflow and potential remote code
 execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.6.24, 2.8.21, and 2.10.10.
 Avoid setting value of -1 or large values for configuration parameters
 MAXSEARCHRESULTS and MAXAGGREGATERESULTS, to avoid exploiting large LIMIT
 arguments.
