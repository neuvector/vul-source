Description:
 WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the HTML
 API in various versions up to 6.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
 and output escaping on URLs. This makes it possible for authenticated
 attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
 scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
 page.
