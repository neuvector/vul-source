Description:
 urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Prior to 2.5.0,
 it is possible to disable redirects for all requests by instantiating a
 PoolManager and specifying retries in a way that disable redirects. By
 default, requests and botocore users are not affected. An application
 attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling
 redirects at the PoolManager level will remain vulnerable. This issue has
 been patched in version 2.5.0.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3 binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-urllib3 is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
