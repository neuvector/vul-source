Description:
 go-gh is a Go module for interacting with the `gh` utility and the GitHub
 API from the command line. A security vulnerability has been identified in
 `go-gh` that could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to
 non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace. `go-gh` sources authentication
 tokens from different environment variables depending on the host involved:
 1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub.com and ghe.com and 2.
 `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` for GitHub Enterprise
 Server. Prior to version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` could source a token
 from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for a host other than
 GitHub.com or ghe.com when within a codespace. In version `2.11.1`,
 `auth.TokenForHost` will only source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
 environment variable for GitHub.com or ghe.com hosts. Successful
 exploitation could send authentication token to an unintended host. This
 issue has been addressed in version 2.11.1 and all users are advised to
 upgrade. Users are also advised to regenerate authentication tokens and to
 review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions
 associated with their account or enterprise.
