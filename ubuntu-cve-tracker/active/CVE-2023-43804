Description:
 urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't
 treat the `Cookie` HTTP header special or provide any helpers for managing
 cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user. However, it is
 possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak
 information via HTTP redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't
 disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been patched in urllib3
 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3 binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-urllib3 is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
