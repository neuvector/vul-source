Description:
 A mismatch caused by client-triggered server-sent stream resets between
 HTTP/2 specifications and the internal architectures of some HTTP/2
 implementations may result in excessive server resource consumption leading
 to denial-of-service (DoS).  By opening streams and then rapidly triggering
 the server to reset them—using malformed frames or flow control errors—an
 attacker can exploit incorrect stream accounting. Streams reset by the
 server are considered closed at the protocol level, even though backend
 processing continues. This allows a client to cause the server to handle an
 unbounded number of concurrent streams on a single connection. This CVE
 will be updated as affected product details are released.
