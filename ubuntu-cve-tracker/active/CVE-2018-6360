Description:
 mpv through 0.28.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted web site, because it reads HTML documents containing VIDEO
 elements, and accepts arbitrary URLs in a src attribute without a protocol
 whitelist in player/lua/ytdl_hook.lua. For example, an
 av://lavfi:ladspa=file= URL signifies that the product should call dlopen
 on a shared object file located at an arbitrary local pathname. The issue
 exists because the product does not consider that youtube-dl can provide a
 potentially unsafe URL.
