Description:
 libtpms, a library that provides software emulation of a Trusted Platform
 Module, has a flaw in versions 0.10.0 and 0.10.1. The commonly used
 integration of libtpms with OpenSSL 3.x contained a vulnerability related
 to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric ciphers
 were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to
 the caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption and decryption steps.
 The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
 Version 0.10.2 fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.
