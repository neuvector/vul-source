Description:
 aiosmptd is  a reimplementation of the Python stdlib smtpd.py based on
 asyncio. Prior to version 1.4.6, servers based on aiosmtpd accept extra
 unencrypted commands after STARTTLS, treating them as if they came from
 inside the encrypted connection. This could be exploited by a
 man-in-the-middle attack. Version 1.4.6 contains a patch for the issue.
