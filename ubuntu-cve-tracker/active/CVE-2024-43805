Description:
 jupyterlab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible
 computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook Architecture. This vulnerability
 depends on user interaction by opening a malicious notebook with Markdown
 cells, or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature. A malicious user
 can access any data that the attacked user has access to as well as perform
 arbitrary requests acting as the attacked user. JupyterLab v3.6.8, v4.2.5
 and Jupyter Notebook v7.2.2 have been patched to resolve this issue. Users
 are advised to upgrade. There is no workaround for the underlying DOM
 Clobbering susceptibility. However, select plugins can be disabled on
 deployments which cannot update in a timely fashion to minimise the risk.
 These are: 1. `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin` - users will loose
 ability to preview mathematical equations. 2.
 `@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability to
 open Markdown previews. 3. `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin` (if
 installed with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package) - an older version
 of the mathjax plugin for JupyterLab 4.x. To disable these extensions run:
 ```jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin
 && jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin &&
 jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin ``` in
 bash.
