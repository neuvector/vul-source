Description:
 OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR
 file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry.
 Version 3.3.2 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow during a read
 operation due to bad pointer math when decompressing DWAA-packed scan-line
 EXR files with a maliciously forged chunk. This is fixed in version 3.3.3.
