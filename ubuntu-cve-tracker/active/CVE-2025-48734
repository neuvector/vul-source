Description:
 Improper Access Control vulnerability in Apache Commons.
 
 
 
 A special BeanIntrospector class was added in version 1.9.2. This can be
 used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum
 objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not
 enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now
 disallows declared class level property access by default.
 
 
 
 
 
 Releases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when
 accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using
 Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to
 the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the
 enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java
 “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote
 attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same
 issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().
 Starting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector
 suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new
 BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain
 the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.
 
 This issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x
 before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils
 
  1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.
 
 
 Users of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2
 
  2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.
