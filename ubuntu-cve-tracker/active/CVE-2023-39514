Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting
 (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data
 stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by
 administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's
 browser at view-time. The script under `graphs.php` displays graph details
 such as data-source paths, data template information and graph related
 fields. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure either a
 data-source template with malicious code appended in the data-source name
 or a device with a malicious payload injected in the device name, may
 deploy a stored XSS attack against any user with _General
 Administration>Graphs_ privileges. A user that possesses the _Template
 Editor>Data Templates_ permissions can configure the data-source name in
 _cacti_. Please note that this may be a _low privileged_ user. This
 configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_templates.php` by
 editing an existing or adding a new data template. If a template is linked
 to a graph then the formatted template name will be rendered in the graph's
 management page. A user that possesses the _General
 Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device
 name in _cacti_. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25.
 Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should add manual
 HTML escaping.
