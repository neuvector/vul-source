Description:
 JavaScript preprocessing, webhooks and global scripts can cause
 uncontrolled CPU, memory, and disk I/O utilization.
 Preprocessing/webhook/global script configuration and testing are only
 available to Administrative roles (Admin and Superadmin). Administrative
 privileges should be typically granted to users who need to perform tasks
 that require more control over the system. The security risk is limited
 because not all users have this level of access.
