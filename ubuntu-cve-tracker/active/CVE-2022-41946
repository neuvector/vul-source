Description:
 pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. In affected versions a
 prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int,
 InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will create
 a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This will create a
 temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but
 not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared
 between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and
 directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable
 by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other
 users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is
 purely an information disclosure vulnerability. Because certain JDK file
 system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the
 version of the JDK you are using. Java 1.7 and higher users: this
 vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.0. Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is
 available. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6,
 specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory
 that is exclusively owned by the executing user will mitigate this
 vulnerability.
