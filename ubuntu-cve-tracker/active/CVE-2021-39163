Description:
 Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over
 IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name,
 avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the
 room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable
 homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create
 groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create
 groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this
 information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only
 homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has
 been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to
 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential
 workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to
 `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to
 prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are
 using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality,
 block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and
 `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.
