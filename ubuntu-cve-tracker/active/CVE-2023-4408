Description:
 The DNS message parsing code in `named` includes a section whose
 computational complexity is overly high. It does not cause problems for
 typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive
 CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This
 issue affects both authoritative servers and recursive resolvers. This
 issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through
 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1
 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
