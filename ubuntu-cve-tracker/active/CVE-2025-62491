Description:
 A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability exists in the QuickJS engine's
 standard library when iterating over the global list of unhandled rejected
 promises (ts->rejected_promise_list).
 
   *  The function js_std_promise_rejection_check attempts to iterate over
 the rejected_promise_list to report unhandled rejections using a standard
 list loop.
 
 
   *  The reason for a promise rejection is processed inside the loop,
 including calling js_std_dump_error1(ctx, rp->reason).
 
 
   *  If the promise rejection reason is an Error object that defines a
 custom property getter (e.g., via Object.defineProperty), this getter is
 executed during the error dumping process.
 
 
   *  The malicious custom getter can execute JavaScript code that calls
 catch() on the same rejected promise being processed.
 
 
   *  Calling catch() internally triggers js_std_promise_rejection_tracker,
 which then removes and frees the current promise entry
 (JSRejectedPromiseEntry) from the rejected_promise_list.
 
 
   *  Since the list iteration continues using the now-freed memory pointer
 (el), the subsequent loop access results in a Use-After-Free condition.
