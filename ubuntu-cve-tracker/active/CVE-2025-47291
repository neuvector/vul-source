Description:
 containerd is an open-source container runtime. A bug was found in the
 containerd's CRI implementation where containerd, starting in version 2.0.1
 and prior to version 2.0.5, doesn't put usernamespaced containers under the
 Kubernetes' cgroup hierarchy, therefore some Kubernetes limits are not
 honored. This may cause a denial of service of the Kubernetes node. This
 bug has been fixed in containerd 2.0.5+ and 2.1.0+. Users should update to
 these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, disable
 usernamespaced pods in Kubernetes temporarily.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Traditionally the containerd source package contained both the
 alexmurray> library and docker application. However, in releases that
 alexmurray> contain the
 alexmurray> containerd-app source package, the containerd source package
 alexmurray> contains only
 alexmurray> the library whilst the docker application itself is contained
 alexmurray> in the
 alexmurray> containerd-app package.
