Description:
 DOMPurify is a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant XSS sanitizer for HTML,
 MathML and SVG. It has been discovered that malicious HTML using special
 nesting techniques can bypass the depth checking added to DOMPurify in
 recent releases. It was also possible to use Prototype Pollution to weaken
 the depth check. This renders dompurify unable to avoid cross site
 scripting (XSS) attacks. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.5.4
 and 3.1.3 of DOMPurify. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this vulnerability.
