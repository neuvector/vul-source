Description:
 EndpointRequest.to() creates a matcher for null/** if the actuator
 endpoint, for which the EndpointRequest has been created, is disabled or
 not exposed.
 
 Your application may be affected by this if all the following conditions
 are met:
 
   *  You use Spring Security
   *  EndpointRequest.to() has been used in a Spring Security chain
 configuration
   *  The endpoint which EndpointRequest references is disabled or not
 exposed via web
   *  Your application handles requests to /null and this path needs
 protection
 
 
 You are not affected if any of the following is true:
 
   *  You don't use Spring Security
   *  You don't use EndpointRequest.to()
   *  The endpoint which EndpointRequest.to() refers to is enabled and is
 exposed
   *  Your application does not handle requests to /null or this path does
 not need protection
