Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen 4.9 through 4.14.x. On Arm, a guest is
 allowed to control whether memory accesses are bypassing the cache. This
 means that Xen needs to ensure that all writes (such as the ones during
 scrubbing) have reached the memory before handing over the page to a guest.
 Unfortunately, the operation to clean the cache is happening before
 checking if the page was scrubbed. Therefore there is no guarantee when all
 the writes will reach the memory.
