Description:
 A flaw was found in libxslt where the attribute type, atype, flags are
 modified in a way that corrupts internal memory management. When XSLT
 functions, such as the key() process, result in tree fragments, this
 corruption prevents the proper cleanup of ID attributes. As a result, the
 system may access freed memory, causing crashes or enabling attackers to
 trigger heap corruption.
