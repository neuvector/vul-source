 https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdk-pixbuf/-/issues/249
Description:
 A flaw exists in gdk‑pixbuf within the
 gdk_pixbuf__jpeg_image_load_increment function (io-jpeg.c) and in glib’s
 g_base64_encode_step (glib/gbase64.c). When processing maliciously crafted
 JPEG images, a heap buffer overflow can occur during Base64 encoding,
 allowing out-of-bounds reads from heap memory, potentially causing
 application crashes or arbitrary code execution.
