Description:
 Requests is a HTTP library. Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases
 prior to 2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific
 maliciously-crafted URLs. Users should upgrade to version 2.32.4 to receive
 a fix. For older versions of Requests, use of the .netrc file can be
 disabled with `trust_env=False` on one's Requests Session.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles requests
 mdeslaur> binaries when built. After updating requests, a no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, requests is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
