Description:
 In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in
 CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not
 properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were
 found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not
 discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names
 of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed
 through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in
 a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an
 attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
 script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be
 replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4
 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected
 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).
