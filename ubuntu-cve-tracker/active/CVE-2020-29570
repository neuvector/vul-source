Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Recording of the per-vCPU
 control block mapping maintained by Xen and that of pointers into the
 control block is reversed. The consumer assumes, seeing the former
 initialized, that the latter are also ready for use. Malicious or buggy
 guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the
 entire system.
