Description:
 The Keras Model.load_model function permits arbitrary code execution, even
 with safe_mode=True, through a manually constructed, malicious .keras
 archive. By altering the config.json file within the archive, an attacker
 can specify arbitrary Python modules and functions, along with their
 arguments, to be loaded and executed during model loading.
