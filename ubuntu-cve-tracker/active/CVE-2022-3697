Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible in the amazon.aws collection when using the
 tower_callback parameter from the amazon.aws.ec2_instance module. This flaw
 allows an attacker to take advantage of this issue as the module is
 handling the parameter insecurely, leading to the password leaking in the
 logs.
