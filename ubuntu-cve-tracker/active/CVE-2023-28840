Description:
 Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is
 distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other
 downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which
 is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*. Swarm Mode,
 which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus
 present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container
 orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and
 supporting network code. The overlay network driver is a core feature of
 Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication
 between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an
 implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet)
 frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI)
 that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay
 network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which
 is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network
 between nodes. Encrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the
 VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload
 protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted
 overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication
 through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and
 confidentiality through encryption. When setting an endpoint up on an
 encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel
 firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules
 rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to
 directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can
 be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other
 overlay networks or other users of VXLAN. Two iptables rules serve to
 filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted
 network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the
 end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been
 previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take
 precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams,
 which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been
 discarded. The injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial
 of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP
 or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would
 otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations
 beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.
 Patches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis
 Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that
 platform should update to 20.10.16. Some workarounds are available. Close
 the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the
 Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that
 the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.
