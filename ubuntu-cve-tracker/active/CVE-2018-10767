Description:
 There is a stack-based buffer over-read in calling GLib in the function
 gxps_images_guess_content_type of gxps-images.c in libgxps through 0.3.0
 because it does not reject negative return values from a
 g_input_stream_read call. A crafted input will lead to a remote denial of
 service attack.
