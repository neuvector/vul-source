 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-30847
Description:
 H2O is an HTTP server. In versions 2.3.0-beta2 and prior, when the reverse
 proxy handler tries to processes a certain type of invalid HTTP request, it
 tries to build an upstream URL by reading from uninitialized pointer. This
 behavior can lead to crashes or leak of information to back end HTTP
 servers. Pull request number 3229 fixes the issue. The pull request has
 been merged to the `master` branch in commit f010336. Users should upgrade
 to commit f010336 or later.
