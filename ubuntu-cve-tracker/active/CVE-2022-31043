Description:
 Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions
 `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a
 request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect
 to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization`
 header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header
 if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did
 not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the
 host. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as
 possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade
 to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an
 alternative approach which would be to use their own redirect middleware.
 Alternately users may simply disable redirects all together if redirects
 are not expected or required.
