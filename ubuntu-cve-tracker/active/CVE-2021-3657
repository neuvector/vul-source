Description:
 A flaw was found in mbsync versions prior to 1.4.4. Due to inadequate
 handling of extremely large (>=2GiB) IMAP literals, malicious or
 compromised IMAP servers, and hypothetically even external email senders,
 could cause several different buffer overflows, which could conceivably be
 exploited for remote code execution.
