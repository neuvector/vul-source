Description:
 WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in
 PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. In affected versions
 output data of the function wp_die() can be leaked under certain
 conditions, which can include data like nonces. It can then be used to
 perform actions on your behalf. This has been patched in WordPress 5.8.1,
 along with any older affected versions via minor releases. It's strongly
 recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix.
