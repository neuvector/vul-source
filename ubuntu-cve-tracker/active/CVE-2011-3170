Description:
 The gif_read_lzw function in filter/image-gif.c in CUPS 1.4.8 and earlier
 does not properly handle the first code word in an LZW stream, which allows
 remote attackers to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly
 execute arbitrary code, via a crafted stream, a different vulnerability
 than CVE-2011-2896.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This also affects cups 1.5.x and isn't fixed in 1.5.0
 mdeslaur> gimp was fixed correctly with a single commit, so doesn't have
 mdeslaur> this issue, which is an incomplete fix.
