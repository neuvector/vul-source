Description:
 An issue was discovered in SchedMD Slurm 23.02.x and 23.11.x. There is
 Incorrect Access Control because of a slurmd Message Integrity Bypass. An
 attacker can reuse root-level authentication tokens during interaction with
 the slurmd process. This bypasses the RPC message hashes that protect
 against undesired MUNGE credential reuse. The fixed versions are 23.02.7
 and 23.11.1.
