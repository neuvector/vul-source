Description:
 An issue was discovered in Ankitects Anki through 25.02. A crafted shared
 deck can result in attacker-controlled access to the internal API (even
 though the attacker has no knowledge of an API key) through approaches such
 as scripts or the SRC attribute of an IMG element. NOTE: this issue exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-32484.
