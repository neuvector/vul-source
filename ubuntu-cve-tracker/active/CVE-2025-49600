Description:
 In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_verify may accept invalid
 signatures if hash computation fails and internal errors go unchecked,
 enabling LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) forgery in a fault scenario.
 Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an
 attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS
 signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance
 of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the
 internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and
 create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an
 integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure
 occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain
 uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is
 unpredictable. When the software implementation of SHA-256 is used, these
 functions will not fail. However, with hardware-accelerated hashing, an
 attacker could use fault injection against the accelerator to bypass
 verification.
