Description:
 There exists a heap buffer overflow vulnerable in Abseil-cpp. The sized
 constructors, reserve(), and rehash() methods of
 absl::{flat,node}hash{set,map} did not impose an upper bound on their size
 argument. As a result, it was possible for a caller to pass a very large
 size that would cause an integer overflow when computing the size of the
 container's backing store, and a subsequent out-of-bounds memory write.
 Subsequent accesses to the container might also access out-of-bounds
 memory. We recommend upgrading past commit
