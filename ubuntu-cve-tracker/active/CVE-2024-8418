Description:
 A flaw was found in Aardvark-dns, which is vulnerable to a Denial of
 Service attack due to the serial processing of TCP DNS queries. An attacker
 can exploit this flaw by keeping a TCP connection open indefinitely,
 causing the server to become unresponsive and resulting in other DNS
 queries timing out. This issue prevents legitimate users from accessing DNS
 services, thereby disrupting normal operations and causing service
 downtime.
