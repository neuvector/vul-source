Description:
 It was found that the Token Processing Service (TPS) did not properly
 sanitize the Token IDs from the "Activity" page, enabling a Stored Cross
 Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker could trick
 an authenticated victim into creating a specially crafted activity, which
 would execute arbitrary JavaScript code when viewed in a browser. All
 versions of pki-core are believed to be vulnerable.
