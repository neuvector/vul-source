Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. In versions prior to 2.2.19,
 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, ``Rack::Multipart::Parser` stores non-file form fields
 (parts without a `filename`) entirely in memory as Ruby `String` objects. A
 single large text field in a multipart/form-data request (hundreds of
 megabytes or more) can consume equivalent process memory, potentially
 leading to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and denial of service (DoS).
 Attackers can send large non-file fields to trigger excessive memory usage.
 Impact scales with request size and concurrency, potentially leading to
 worker crashes or severe garbage-collection overhead. All Rack applications
 processing multipart form submissions are affected. Versions 2.2.19,
 3.1.17, and 3.2.2 enforce a reasonable size cap for non-file fields (e.g.,
 2 MiB). Workarounds include restricting maximum request body size at the
 web-server or proxy layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`) and
 validating and rejecting unusually large form fields at the application
 level.
