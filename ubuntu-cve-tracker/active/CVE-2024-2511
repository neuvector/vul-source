Description:
 Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause
 unbounded
 memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions
 
 Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to
 trigger
 unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service
 
 This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET
 option is
 being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the
 default
 anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions,
 the
 session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush
 properly
 as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded
 manner. A
 malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
 force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal
 operation.
 
 This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect
 TLS
 clients.
 
 The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
 OpenSSL
 1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.
