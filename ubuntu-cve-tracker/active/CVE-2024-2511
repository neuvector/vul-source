Description:
 Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause
 unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions Impact summary: An
 attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger unbounded
 memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service This problem can occur
 in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (but
 not if early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replay
 protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the session
 cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly as
 it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
 malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
 force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal
 operation. This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does
 not affect TLS clients. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not
 affected by this issue. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.
