Description:
 calibre is an e-book manager. In versions 8.13.0 and prior, calibre does
 not validate filenames when handling binary assets in FB2 files, allowing
 an attacker to write arbitrary files on the filesystem when viewing or
 converting a malicious FictionBook file. This can be leveraged to achieve
 arbitrary code execution. This issue is fixed in version 8.14.0.
