Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2. During the network boot process, when trying to
 search for the configuration file, grub copies data from a user controlled
 environment variable into an internal buffer using the grub_strcpy()
 function. During this step, it fails to consider the environment variable
 length when allocating the internal buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds
 write. If correctly exploited, this issue may result in remote code
 execution through the same network segment grub is searching for the boot
 information, which can be used to by-pass secure boot protections.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
