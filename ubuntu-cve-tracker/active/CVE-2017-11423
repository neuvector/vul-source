Description:
 The cabd_read_string function in mspack/cabd.c in libmspack 0.5alpha, as
 used in ClamAV 0.99.2 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (stack-based buffer over-read and application crash)
 via a crafted CAB file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> clamav in xenial+ uses the system libmspack, trusty uses
 mdeslaur> the embedded one.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> code in trusty clamav is different, doesn't appear vulnerable
