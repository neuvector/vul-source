Description:
 An issue was discovered in xenoprof in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest
 OS users (with active profiling) to obtain sensitive information about
 other guests, cause a denial of service, or possibly gain privileges. For
 guests for which "active" profiling was enabled by the administrator, the
 xenoprof code uses the standard Xen shared ring structure. Unfortunately,
 this code did not treat the guest as a potential adversary: it trusts the
 guest not to modify buffer size information or modify head / tail pointers
 in unexpected ways. This can crash the host (DoS). Privilege escalation
 cannot be ruled out.
