Description:
 Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted
 framework. In affected versions it may be possible for a deactivated user
 to login when using uncommon configurations. This only applies if any of
 the following are true: 1. JSON Web Tokens are enabled for login via the
 `jwt_config.enabled` configuration setting. 2. The local password database
 is enabled via the `password_config.enabled` and
 `password_config.localdb_enabled` configuration settings *and* a user's
 password is updated via an admin API after a user is deactivated. Note that
 the local password database is enabled by default, but it is uncommon to
 set a user's password after they've been deactivated. Installations that
 are configured to only allow login via Single Sign-On (SSO) via CAS, SAML
 or OpenID Connect (OIDC); or via an external password provider (e.g. LDAP)
 are not affected. If not using JSON Web Tokens, ensure that deactivated
 users do not have a password set. This issue has been addressed in version
 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
