Description:
 In the standard library in Rust before 1.49.0, String::retain() function
 has a panic safety problem. It allows creation of a non-UTF-8 Rust string
 when the provided closure panics. This bug could result in a memory safety
 violation when other string APIs assume that UTF-8 encoding is used on the
 same string.
