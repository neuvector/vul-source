Description:
 Unauthenticated RCE is possible when JMeter is used in distributed mode (-r
 or -R command line options). Attacker can establish a RMI connection to a
 jmeter-server using RemoteJMeterEngine and proceed with an attack using
 untrusted data deserialization. This only affect tests running in
 Distributed mode. Note that versions before 4.0 are not able to encrypt
 traffic between the nodes, nor authenticate the participating nodes so
 upgrade to JMeter 5.1 is also advised.
