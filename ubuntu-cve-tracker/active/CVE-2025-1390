Description:
 The PAM module pam_cap.so of libcap configuration supports group names
 starting with “@”, during actual parsing, configurations not starting with
 “@” are incorrectly recognized as group names. This may result in
 nonintended users being granted an inherited capability set, potentially
 leading to security risks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to
 achieve local privilege escalation on systems where
 /etc/security/capability.conf is used to configure user inherited
 privileges by constructing specific usernames.
