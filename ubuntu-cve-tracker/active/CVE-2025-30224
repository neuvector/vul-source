Description:
 MyDumper is a MySQL Logical Backup Tool. The MySQL C client library
 (libmysqlclient) allows authenticated remote actors to read arbitrary files
 from client systems via a crafted server response to LOAD LOCAL INFILE
 query, leading to sensitive information disclosure when clients connect to
 untrusted MySQL servers without explicitly disabling the local infile
 capability. Mydumper has the local infile option enabled by default and
 does not have an option to disable it. This can lead to an unexpected
 arbitrary file read if the Mydumper tool connects to an untrusted server.
 This vulnerability is fixed in 0.18.2-8.
