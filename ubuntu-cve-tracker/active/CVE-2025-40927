Description:
 CGI::Simple versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting
 flaw
 This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in
 CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used
 for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.
 
 Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded
 values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response
 via query parameters.
 
 
 
 As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the
 parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject
 arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected
 cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.
 
 The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410
 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was
 incomplete.
 
 Impact
 
 By injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:
 
   *  Break the current HTTP header
   *  Inject a new header or entire body
   *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response
 That can lead to the following attacks:
 
   *  reflected XSS
   *  open redirect
   *  cache poisoning
   *  header manipulation
