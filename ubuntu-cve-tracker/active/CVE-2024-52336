Description:
 A script injection vulnerability was identified in the Tuned package. The
 `instance_create()` D-Bus function can be called by locally logged-in users
 without authentication. This flaw allows a local non-privileged user to
 execute a D-Bus call with `script_pre` or `script_post` options that permit
 arbitrary scripts with their absolute paths to be passed. These user or
 attacker-controlled executable scripts or programs could then be executed
 by Tuned with root privileges that could allow attackers to local privilege
 escalation.
