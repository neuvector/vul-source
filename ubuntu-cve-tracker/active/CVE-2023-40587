Description:
 Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal
 vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of Python
 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and
 have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the
 location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal
 exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is
 `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2 rejects any path that contains a
 null-byte out of caution. While valid in directory/file names, we would
 strongly consider it a mistake to use null-bytes in naming
 files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and 3.12 has fixed the underlying
 issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer truncate on the first `0x00`
 found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11 Python, un an as of yet
 unreleased version. Fixes will be available in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5.
 Some workarounds are available. Use a version of Python 3 that is not
 affected, downgrade to Python 3.10 series temporarily, or wait until Python
 3.11.5 is released and upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

Bugs:
Priority: low
 Does not affect all users of Pyramid, only those using a static view with
 a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located
 exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system
 path and only exposes the `index.html` file.
