Description:
 containerd is an open-source container runtime. Versions 1.7.28 and below,
 2.0.0-beta.0 through 2.0.6, 2.1.0-beta.0 through 2.1.4, and 2.2.0-beta.0
 through 2.2.0-rc.1 contain a bug in the CRI Attach implementation where a
 user can exhaust memory on the host due to goroutine leaks. This issue is
 fixed in versions 1.7.29, 2.0.7, 2.1.5 and 2.2.0. To workaround this
 vulnerability, users can set up an admission controller to control accesses
 to pods/attach resources.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Traditionally the containerd source package contained both the
 alexmurray> library and docker application. However, in releases that
 alexmurray> contain the
 alexmurray> containerd-app source package, the containerd source package
 alexmurray> contains only
 alexmurray> the library whilst the docker application itself is contained
 alexmurray> in the
 alexmurray> containerd-app package.
