Description:
 Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow
 changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds
 writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This
 could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to
 those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode
 than otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.
