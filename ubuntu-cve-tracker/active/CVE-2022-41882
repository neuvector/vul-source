Description:
 The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud
 Server with your computer. In version 3.6.0, if a user received a malicious
 file share and has it synced locally or the virtual filesystem enabled and
 clicked a nc://open/ link it will open the default editor for the file type
 of the shared file, which on Windows can also sometimes mean that a file
 depending on the type, e.g. "vbs", is being executed. It is recommended
 that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to version 3.6.1. As a
 workaround, users can block the Nextcloud Desktop client 3.6.0 by setting
 the `minimum.supported.desktop.version` system config to `3.6.1` on the
 server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded
 anymore. Already existing files can still be used. Another workaround would
 be to enforce shares to be accepted by setting the
 `sharing.force_share_accept` system config to `true` on the server, so new
 files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore.
 Already existing shares can still be abused.
