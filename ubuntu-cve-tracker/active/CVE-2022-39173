Description:
 In wolfSSL before 5.5.1, malicious clients can cause a buffer overflow
 during a TLS 1.3 handshake. This occurs when an attacker supposedly resumes
 a previous TLS session. During the resumption Client Hello a Hello Retry
 Request must be triggered. Both Client Hellos are required to contain a
 list of duplicate cipher suites to trigger the buffer overflow. In total,
 two Client Hellos have to be sent: one in the resumed session, and a second
 one as a response to a Hello Retry Request message.

Notes:
 ccdm94> MariaDB 10.6 package includes wolfSSL code under directory
 ccdm94> 'extra', however, Ubuntu builds MariaDB 10.6 with OpenSSL
