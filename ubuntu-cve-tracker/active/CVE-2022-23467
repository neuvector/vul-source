Description:
 OpenRazer is an open source driver and user-space daemon to control Razer
 device lighting and other features on GNU/Linux. Using a modified USB
 device an attacker can leak stack addresses of the
 `razer_attr_read_dpi_stages`, potentially bypassing KASLR. To exploit this
 vulnerability an attacker would need to access to a users keyboard or mouse
 or would need to convince a user to use a modified device. The issue has
 been patched in v3.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade and should be reminded
 not to plug in unknown USB devices.
