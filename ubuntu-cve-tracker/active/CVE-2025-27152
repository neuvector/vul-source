Description:
 axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. The issue
 occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to
 axios. Even if ?baseURL is set, axios sends the request to the specified
 absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue
 impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios. This issue is
 fixed in 1.8.2.
