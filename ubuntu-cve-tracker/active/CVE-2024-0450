Description:
 An issue was found in the CPython `zipfile` module affecting versions
 3.12.1, 3.11.7, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, and 3.8.18 and prior. The zipfile module
 is vulnerable to “quoted-overlap” zip-bombs which exploit the zip format to
 create a zip-bomb with a high compression ratio. The fixed versions of
 CPython makes the zipfile module reject zip archives which overlap entries
 in the archive.
