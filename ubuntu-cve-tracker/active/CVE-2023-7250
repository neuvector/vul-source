Description:
 A flaw was found in iperf, a utility for testing network performance using
 TCP, UDP, and SCTP. A malicious or malfunctioning client can send less than
 the expected amount of data to the iperf server, which can cause the server
 to hang indefinitely waiting for the remainder or until the connection gets
 closed. This will prevent other connections to the server, leading to a
 denial of service.
