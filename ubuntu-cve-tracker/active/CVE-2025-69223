Description:
 AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. Versions 3.13.2 and below allow a zip bomb to be used to execute a
 DoS against the AIOHTTP server. An attacker may be able to send a
 compressed request that when decompressed by AIOHTTP could exhaust the
 host's memory. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.
