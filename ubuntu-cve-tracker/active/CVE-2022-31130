Description:
 Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform.
 Versions of Grafana for endpoints prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 could leak
 authentication tokens to some destination plugins under some conditions.
 The vulnerability impacts data source and plugin proxy endpoints with
 authentication tokens. The destination plugin could receive a user's
 Grafana authentication token. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for
 this issue. As a workaround, do not use API keys, JWT authentication, or
 any HTTP Header based authentication.
