Description:
 A vulnerability was found in the pkcs15-init tool in OpenSC. An attacker
 could use a crafted USB Device or Smart Card, which would present the
 system with a specially crafted response to APDUs. When buffers are
 partially filled with data, initialized parts of the buffer can be
 incorrectly accessed.
