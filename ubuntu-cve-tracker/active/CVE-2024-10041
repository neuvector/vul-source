Description:
 A vulnerability was found in PAM. The secret information is stored in
 memory, where the attacker can trigger the victim program to execute by
 sending characters to its standard input (stdin). As this occurs, the
 attacker can train the branch predictor to execute an ROP chain
 speculatively. This flaw could result in leaked passwords, such as those
 found in /etc/shadow while performing authentications.
