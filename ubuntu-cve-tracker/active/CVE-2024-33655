Description:
 The DNS protocol in RFC 1035 and updates allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (resource consumption) by arranging for DNS queries to be
 accumulated for seconds, such that responses are later sent in a pulsing
 burst (which can be considered traffic amplification in some cases), aka
 the "DNSBomb" issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Unbound itself is not vulnerable to the DNSBomb attack, but can
 mdeslaur> be used to participate in one. The commit below adds some
 mdeslaur> new options to make the impact from Unbound significantly lower.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Backporting the commit to mantic and lower is intrusive and
 mdeslaur> may introduce regressions.
