Description:
 Denial of Service due to improper input validation vulnerability for HTTP/2
 requests in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 request, if the
 request exceeded any of the configured limits for headers, the associated
 HTTP/2 stream was not reset until after all of the headers had been
 processed.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through
 11.0.0-M16, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.18, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.85,
 from 8.5.0 through 8.5.98. Users are recommended to upgrade to version
 11.0.0-M17, 10.1.19, 9.0.86 or 8.5.99 which fix the issue.
