Description:
 An issue was discovered in Bento4 1.5.1.0. A memory allocation failure is
 unhandled in Core/Ap4SdpAtom.cpp and leads to crashes. When parsing input
 video, the program allocates a new buffer to parse an atom in the stream.
 The unhandled memory allocation failure causes a direct copy to a NULL
 pointer.
