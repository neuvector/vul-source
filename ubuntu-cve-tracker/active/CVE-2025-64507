Description:
 Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. An issue in
 versions prior to 6.0.6 and 6.19.0 affects any Incus user in an environment
 where an unprivileged user may have root access to a container with an
 attached custom storage volume that has the `security.shifted` property set
 to `true` as well as access to the host as an unprivileged user. The most
 common case for this would be systems using `incus-user` with the less
 privileged `incus` group to provide unprivileged users with an isolated
 restricted access to Incus. Such users may be able to create a custom
 storage volume with the necessary property (depending on kernel and
 filesystem support) and can then write a setuid binary from within the
 container which can be executed as an unprivileged user on the host to gain
 root privileges. A patch for this issue is expected in versions 6.0.6 and
 6.19.0. As a workaround, permissions can be manually restricted until a
 patched version of Incus is deployed.
