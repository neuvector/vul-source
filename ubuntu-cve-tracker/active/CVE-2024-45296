Description:
 path-to-regexp turns path strings into a regular expressions. In certain
 cases, path-to-regexp will output a regular expression that can be
 exploited to cause poor performance. Because JavaScript is single threaded
 and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the
 event loop and lead to a DoS. The bad regular expression is generated any
 time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by
 something that is not a period (.). For users of 0.1, upgrade to 0.1.10.
 All other users should upgrade to 8.0.0.
