Description:
 7-Zip Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows
 remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on
 affected installations of 7-Zip. User interaction is required to exploit
 this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
 malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When
 extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web,
 7-Zip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An
 attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the
 context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-25456.
