Description:
 There exists an unchecked length field in UBoot. The U-Boot DFU
 implementation does not bound the length field in USB DFU download setup
 packets, and it does not verify that the transfer direction corresponds to
 the specified command. Consequently, if a physical attacker crafts a USB
 DFU download setup packet with a `wLength` greater than 4096 bytes, they
 can write beyond the heap-allocated request buffer.
