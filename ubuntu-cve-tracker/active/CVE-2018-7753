Description:
 An issue was discovered in Bleach 2.1.x before 2.1.3. Attributes that have
 URI values weren't properly sanitized if the values contained character
 entities. Using character entities, it was possible to construct a URI
 value with a scheme that was not allowed that would slide through
 unsanitized.
