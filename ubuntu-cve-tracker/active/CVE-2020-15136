Description:
 In ectd before versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23, gateway TLS authentication is
 only applied to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records. When starting a
 gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified
 in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the
 discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against
 endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. This has been fixed in versions
 3.4.10 and 3.3.23 with improved documentation and deprecation of the
 functionality.
