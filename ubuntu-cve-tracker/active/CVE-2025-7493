Description:
 A privilege escalation flaw from host to domain administrator was found in
 FreeIPA. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2025-4404, where it fails to
 validate the uniqueness of the krbCanonicalName. While the previously
 released version added validations for the admin@REALM credential, FreeIPA
 still does not validate the root@REALM canonical name, which can also be
 used as the realm administrator's name. This flaw allows an attacker to
 perform administrative tasks over the REALM, leading to access to sensitive
 data and sensitive data exfiltration.
