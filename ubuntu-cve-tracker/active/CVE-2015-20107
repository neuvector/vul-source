Description:
 In Python (aka CPython) up to 3.10.8, the mailcap module does not add
 escape characters into commands discovered in the system mailcap file. This
 may allow attackers to inject shell commands into applications that call
 mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
 user-provided filenames or arguments). The fix is also back-ported to 3.7,
 3.8, 3.9
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 leosilva> patch was proposed in cpython Lib/mailcap.py but not merged yet.
 leosilva> it sounds a better approach was PR to fix that issue, but still
 leosilva> not merged yet.
 leosilva> there are plenty of discussions going on about proper ways to fix
 leosilva> that issue, but none was accept yet that fix the issue and keep
 leosilva> the software working properly.
