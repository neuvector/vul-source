 https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/501712998589763d411a68d35e3cda98fd9cfd18/cmd_realtime.php#L119
Description:
 Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. A
 command injection vulnerability on the 1.3.x DEV branch allows any
 unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary command on the server when
 `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. In `cmd_realtime.php` line 119,
 the `$poller_id` used as part of the command execution is sourced from
 `$_SERVER['argv']`, which can be controlled by URL when
 `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. And this option is `On` by
 default in many environments such as the main PHP Docker image for PHP.
 Commit 53e8014d1f082034e0646edc6286cde3800c683d contains a patch for the
 issue, but this commit was reverted in commit
 99633903cad0de5ace636249de16f77e57a3c8fc.
