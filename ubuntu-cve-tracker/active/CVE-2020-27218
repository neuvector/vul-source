Description:
 In Eclipse Jetty version 9.4.0.RC0 to 9.4.34.v20201102, 10.0.0.alpha0 to
 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.0.beta2, if GZIP request body
 inflation is enabled and requests from different clients are multiplexed
 onto a single connection, and if an attacker can send a request with a body
 that is received entirely but not consumed by the application, then a
 subsequent request on the same connection will see that body prepended to
 its body. The attacker will not see any data but may inject data into the
 body of the subsequent request.
