Description:
 A flaw in libsoup’s HTTP header handling allows multiple Host: headers in a
 request and returns the last occurrence for server-side processing. Common
 front proxies often honor the first Host: header, so this mismatch can
 cause vhost confusion where a proxy routes a request to one backend but the
 backend interprets it as destined for another host. This discrepancy
 enables request-smuggling style attacks, cache poisoning, or bypassing
 host-based access controls when an attacker supplies duplicate Host
 headers.
