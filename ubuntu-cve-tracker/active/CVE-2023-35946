Description:
 Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for
 multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its
 dependency cache, it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file
 location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates, Gradle can be made
 to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside
 the dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This
 vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite
 important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle process has
 write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to
 have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have
 the ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this
 would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to
 protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will refuse to cache
 dependencies that have path traversal elements in their dependency
 coordinates. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If
 you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2, `dependency verification`
 will make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit.
