Description:
 Sinatra is a domain-specific language for creating web applications in
 Ruby. An issue was discovered in Sinatra 2.0 before 2.2.3 and 3.0 before
 3.0.4. An application is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD)
 attack that sets the Content-Disposition header of a response when the
 filename is derived from user-supplied input. Version 2.2.3 and 3.0.4
 contain patches for this issue.
