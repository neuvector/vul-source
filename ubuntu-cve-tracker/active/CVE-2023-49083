Description:
 cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and
 recipes to Python developers. Calling `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or
 `load_der_pkcs7_certificates` could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and
 segfault. Exploitation of this vulnerability poses a serious risk of Denial
 of Service (DoS) for any application attempting to deserialize a PKCS7
 blob/certificate. The consequences extend to potential disruptions in
 system availability and stability. This vulnerability has been patched in
 version 41.0.6.
