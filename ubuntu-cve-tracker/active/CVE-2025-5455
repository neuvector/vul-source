Description:
 An issue was found in the private API function qDecodeDataUrl() in QtCore,
 which is used in QTextDocument and QNetworkReply, and, potentially, in user
 code.
 
 If the function was called with malformed data, for example, an URL that
 contained a "charset" parameter that lacked a value (such as
 "data:charset,"), and Qt was built with assertions enabled, then it would
 hit an assertion, resulting in a denial of service
 (abort).
 
 This impacts Qt up to 5.15.18, 6.0.0->6.5.8, 6.6.0->6.8.3 and 6.9.0. This
 has been fixed in 5.15.19, 6.5.9, 6.8.4 and 6.9.1.
