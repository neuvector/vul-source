Description:
 GRUB2 contains a race condition in grub_script_function_create() leading to
 a use-after-free vulnerability which can be triggered by redefining a
 function whilst the same function is already executing, leading to
 arbitrary code execution and secure boot restriction bypass. This issue
 affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Chris Coulson discovered that the GRUB2 function handling code did not
 properly handle a function being redefined, leading to a use-after-free
 vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code
 and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes:
 alexmurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
  and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low
 sbeattie| 809f3a268 script: Avoid a use-after-free when
  redefining a function during execution
