Description:
 Bouncy Castle For Java before 1.74 is affected by an LDAP injection
 vulnerability. The vulnerability only affects applications that use an LDAP
 CertStore from Bouncy Castle to validate X.509 certificates. During the
 certificate validation process, Bouncy Castle inserts the certificate's
 Subject Name into an LDAP search filter without any escaping, which leads
 to an LDAP injection vulnerability.
