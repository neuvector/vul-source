Description:
 ModSecurity is an open source, cross platform web application firewall
 (WAF) engine for Apache, IIS and Nginx. In versions 2.9.8 to before 2.9.11,
 an empty XML tag can cause a segmentation fault. If SecParseXmlIntoArgs is
 set to On or OnlyArgs, and the request type is application/xml, and at
 least one XML tag is empty (eg <foo></foo>), then a segmentation fault
 occurs. This issue has been patched in version 2.9.11. A workaround
 involves setting SecParseXmlIntoArgs to Off.
