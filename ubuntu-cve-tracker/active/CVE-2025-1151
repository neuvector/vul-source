Description:
 A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43. It has been rated as
 problematic. This issue affects the function xmemdup of the file xmemdup.c
 of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may
 be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The
 exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to
 the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this
 issue. The code maintainer explains: "I'm not going to commit some of the
 leak fixes I've been working on to the 2.44 branch due to concern that
 would destabilise ld. All of the reported leaks in this bugzilla have been
 fixed on binutils master."
