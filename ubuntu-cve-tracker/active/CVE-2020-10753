Description:
 A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway).
 The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS
 ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS
 configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the
 CORS request is made. Ceph versions 3.x and 4.x are vulnerable to this
 issue.
