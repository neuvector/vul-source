Description:
 In Suricata before 4.x, it was possible to trigger lots of redundant checks
 on the content of crafted network traffic with a certain signature, because
 of DetectEngineContentInspection in detect-engine-content-inspection.c. The
 search engine doesn't stop when it should after no match is found; instead,
 it stops only upon reaching inspection-recursion-limit (3000 by default).
