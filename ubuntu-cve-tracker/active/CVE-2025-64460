Description:
 An issue was discovered in 5.2 before 5.2.9, 5.1 before 5.1.15, and 4.2
 before 4.2.27.
 Algorithmic complexity in
 `django.core.serializers.xml_serializer.getInnerText()` allows a remote
 attacker to cause a potential denial-of-service attack triggering CPU and
 memory exhaustion via specially crafted XML input processed by the XML
 `Deserializer`.
 Earlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were
 not evaluated and may also be affected.
 Django would like to thank Seokchan Yoon for reporting this issue.
