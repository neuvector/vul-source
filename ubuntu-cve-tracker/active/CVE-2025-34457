Description:
 wb2osz/direwolf (Dire Wolf) versions up to and including 1.8, prior to
 commit 694c954, contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the
 function kiss_rec_byte() located in src/kiss_frame.c. When processing
 crafted KISS frames that reach the maximum allowed frame length
 (MAX_KISS_LEN), the function appends a terminating FEND byte without
 reserving sufficient space in the stack buffer. This results in an
 out-of-bounds write followed by an out-of-bounds read during the subsequent
 call to kiss_unwrap(), leading to stack memory corruption or application
 crashes. This vulnerability may allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
 trigger a denial-of-service condition.
