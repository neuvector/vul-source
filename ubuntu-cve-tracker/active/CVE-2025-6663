Description:
 GStreamer H266 Codec Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction
 with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack
 vectors may vary depending on the implementation.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of H266 sei messages. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
 data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker
 can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the
 current process. Was ZDI-CAN-27381.
