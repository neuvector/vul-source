Description:
 Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. When using an ACL
 on a device connected to a bridge, Incus versions 6.12 and 6.13generates
 nftables rules that partially bypass security options
 `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and
 `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to ARP spoofing on the bridge and
 to fully spoof another VM/container on the same bridge. Commit
 254dfd2483ab8de39b47c2258b7f1cf0759231c8 contains a patch for the issue.
