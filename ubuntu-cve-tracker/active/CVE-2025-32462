Description:
 Sudo's host (`-h` or `--host`) option is intended to be used in
 conjunction with the list option (`-l` or `--list`) to list a user's
 sudo privileges on a host other than the current one.  However, due
 to a bug it was not restricted to listing privileges and could be
 used when running a command via `sudo` or editing a file with
 `sudoedit`.  Depending on the rules present in the sudoers file
 this could allow a local privilege escalation attack. Sudo versions
 1.8.8 to 1.9.17 inclusive are affected.
