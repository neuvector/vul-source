Description:
 When multiple server blocks are configured to share the same IP address and
 port, an attacker can use session resumption to bypass client certificate
 authentication requirements on these servers. This vulnerability arises
 when  TLS Session Tickets
 https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_ticket_key
  are used and/or the  SSL session cache
 https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_cache
 are used in the default server and the default server is performing client
 certificate authentication.  
 
 Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS)
 are not evaluated.
