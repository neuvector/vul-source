Description:
 An authenticated virtual machine escape vulnerability exists in HashiCorp
 Vagrant when using the default synced folder configuration. By design,
 Vagrant automatically mounts the host system’s project directory into the
 guest VM under /vagrant (or C:\vagrant on Windows). This includes the
 Vagrantfile configuration file, which is a Ruby script evaluated by the
 host every time a vagrant command is executed in the project directory. If
 a low-privileged attacker obtains shell access to the guest VM, they can
 append arbitrary Ruby code to the mounted Vagrantfile. When a user on the
 host later runs any vagrant command, the injected code is executed on the
 host with that user’s privileges.
 
  While this shared-folder behavior is well-documented by Vagrant, the
 security implications of Vagrantfile execution from guest-writable storage
 are not explicitly addressed. This effectively enables guest-to-host code
 execution in multi-tenant or adversarial VM scenarios.
