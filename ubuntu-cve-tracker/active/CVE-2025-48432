Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 5.2 before 5.2.3, 5.1 before 5.1.11, and
 4.2 before 4.2.23. Internal HTTP response logging does not escape
 request.path, which allows remote attackers to potentially manipulate log
 output via crafted URLs. This may lead to log injection or forgery when
 logs are viewed in terminals or processed by external systems.
