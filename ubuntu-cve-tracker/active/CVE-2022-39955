Description:
 The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set
 bypass by submitting a specially crafted HTTP Content-Type header field
 that indicates multiple character encoding schemes. A vulnerable back-end
 can potentially be exploited by declaring multiple Content-Type "charset"
 names and therefore bypassing the configurable CRS Content-Type header
 "charset" allow list. An encoded payload can bypass CRS detection this way
 and may then be decoded by the backend. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and
 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and
 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3
 respectively.
