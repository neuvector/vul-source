Description:
 Hickory DNS is a Rust based DNS client, server, and resolver. A
 vulnerability present starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions
 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC
 verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver.
 The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as
 trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a
 result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a
 configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to
 authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this
 vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record
 covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated
 DNSKEY in the same zone. Versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 fix the issue.
