Description:
 Redis through 8.0.3 allows memory consumption via a multi-bulk command
 composed of many bulks, sent by an authenticated user. This occurs because
 the server allocates memory for the command arguments of every bulk, even
 when the command is skipped because of insufficient permissions. NOTE: this
 is disputed by the Supplier because abuse of the commands network protocol
 is not a violation of the Redis Security Model.
