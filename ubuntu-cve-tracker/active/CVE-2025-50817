Description:
 A vulnerability in the Python-Future 1.0.0 module allows for arbitrary code
 execution via the unintended import of a file named test.py. When the
 module is loaded, it automatically imports test.py, if present in the same
 directory or in the sys.path. This behavior can be exploited by an attacker
 who has the ability to write files to the server, allowing the execution of
 arbitrary code. NOTE: Multiple third parties have disputed this issue and
 stated that it is not a security flaw in python-future and is a documented
 feature of Pythonâ€™s import system in the handling of sys.path.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> versions earlier than 1.0.0 are also affected, the "flaw" was
 mdeslaur> introduced in the following commit:
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future/commit/b9c7593e4e1478240522a71a6c85ecd24cc3d20a
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to be an actual vulnerability as "test" is part
 mdeslaur> of the python stdlib. This CVE is likely to be rejected, see
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future/issues/650#issuecomment-3252409616
 mdeslaur> Marking as deferred for now.
