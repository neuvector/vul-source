Description:
 An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting
 HTTP/2 requests. HTTP/2 server connections contain a cache of HTTP header
 keys sent by the client. While the total number of entries in this cache is
 capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to
 allocate approximately 64 MiB per open connection.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
