Description:
 To be able to analyze gradle projects, the build scripts need to be
 executed. Apache NetBeans follows this pattern. This causes the code of the
 build script to be invoked at load time of the project. Apache NetBeans up
 to and including 12.0 did not request consent from the user for the
 analysis of the project at load time. This in turn will run potentially
 malicious code, from an external source, without the consent of the user.
