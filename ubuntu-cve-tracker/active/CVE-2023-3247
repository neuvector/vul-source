Description:
 In PHP versions 8.0.* before 8.0.29, 8.1.* before 8.1.20, 8.2.* before
 8.2.7 when using SOAP HTTP Digest Authentication, random value generator
 was not checked for failure, and was using narrower range of values than it
 should have. In case of random generator failure, it could lead to a
 disclosure of 31 bits of uninitialized memory from the client to the
 server, and it also made easier to a malicious server to guess the client's
 nonce.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> PEAR issues should go against php-pear as of xenial
 rodrigo-zaiden> the method php_random_bytes_throw that is being used for
  nonce generation was added in php7.0 with CSPRNG API, so patching versions
  older than that is not feasible as it would would likely add other issues.
