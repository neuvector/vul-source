Description:
 389-ds-base before version 1.3.6 is vulnerable to an improperly NULL
 terminated array in the uniqueness_entry_to_config() function in the
 "attribute uniqueness" plugin of 389 Directory Server. An authenticated, or
 possibly unauthenticated, attacker could use this flaw to force an
 out-of-bound heap memory read, possibly triggering a crash of the LDAP
 service.
