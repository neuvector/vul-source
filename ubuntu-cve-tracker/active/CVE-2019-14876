Description:
 In the __lshift function of the newlib libc library, all versions prior to
 3.3.0 (see newlib/libc/stdlib/mprec.c), Balloc is used to allocate a big
 integer, however no check is performed to verify if the allocation
 succeeded or not. The access to b1 will trigger a null pointer dereference
 bug in case of a memory allocation failure.
