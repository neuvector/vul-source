Description:
 7-Zip Zstandard Decompression Integer Underflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of 7-Zip. Interaction with this
 library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may
 vary depending on the implementation.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the implementation of Zstandard
 decompression. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
 user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing
 to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in
 the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24346.
