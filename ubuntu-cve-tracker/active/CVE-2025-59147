Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Versions
 7.0.11 and below, as well as 8.0.0, are vulnerable to detection bypass when
 crafted traffic sends multiple SYN packets with different sequence numbers
 within the same flow tuple, which can cause Suricata to fail to pick up the
 TCP session. In IDS mode this can lead to a detection and logging bypass.
 In IPS mode this will lead to the flow getting blocked. This issue is fixed
 in versions 7.0.12 and 8.0.1.
