Description:
 LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create,
 and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. Prior to
 version 1.6.51, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's
 png_do_quantize function when processing PNG files with malformed palette
 indices. The vulnerability occurs when palette_lookup array bounds are not
 validated against externally-supplied image data, allowing an attacker to
 craft a PNG file with out-of-range palette indices that trigger
 out-of-bounds memory access. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.
