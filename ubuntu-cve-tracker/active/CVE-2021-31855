Description:
 KDE Messagelib through 5.17.0 reveals cleartext of encrypted messages in
 some situations. Deleting an attachment of a decrypted encrypted message
 stored on a remote server (e.g., an IMAP server) causes KMail to upload the
 decrypted content of the message to the remote server. With a crafted
 message, a user could be tricked into decrypting an encrypted message and
 then deleting an attachment attached to this message. If the attacker has
 access to the messages stored on the email server, then the attacker could
 read the decrypted content of the encrypted message. This occurs in
 ViewerPrivate::deleteAttachment in messageviewer/src/viewer/viewer_p.cpp.
