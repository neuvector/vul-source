Description:
 A flaw was found in the Undertow HTTP server core, which is used in
 WildFly, JBoss EAP, and other Java applications. The Undertow library fails
 to properly validate the Host header in incoming HTTP requests.As a result,
 requests containing malformed or malicious Host headers are processed
 without rejection, enabling attackers to poison caches, perform internal
 network scans, or hijack user sessions.
