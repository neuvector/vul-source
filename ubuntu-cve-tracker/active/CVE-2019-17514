Description:
 library/glob.html in the Python 2 and 3 documentation before 2016 has
 potentially misleading information about whether sorting occurs, as
 demonstrated by irreproducible cancer-research results. NOTE: the effects
 of this documentation cross application domains, and thus it is likely that
 security-relevant code elsewhere is affected. This issue is not a Python
 implementation bug, and there are no reports that NMR researchers were
 specifically relying on library/glob.html. In other words, because the
 older documentation stated "finds all the pathnames matching a specified
 pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell," one might have
 incorrectly inferred that the sorting that occurs in a Unix shell also
 occurred for glob.glob. There is a workaround in newer versions of
 Willoughby nmr-data_compilation-p2.py and nmr-data_compilation-p3.py, which
 call sort() directly.
