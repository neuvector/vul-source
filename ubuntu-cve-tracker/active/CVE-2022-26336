Description:
 A shortcoming in the HMEF package of poi-scratchpad (Apache POI) allows an
 attacker to cause an Out of Memory exception. This package is used to read
 TNEF files (Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server). If an
 application uses poi-scratchpad to parse TNEF files and the application
 allows untrusted users to supply them, then a carefully crafted file can
 cause an Out of Memory exception. This issue affects poi-scratchpad version
 5.2.0 and prior versions. Users are recommended to upgrade to
 poi-scratchpad 5.2.1.
