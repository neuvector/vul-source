Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. A remote Matrix user with
 malicious intent, sharing a room with Synapse instances before 1.105.1, can
 dispatch specially crafted events to exploit a weakness in the V2 state
 resolution algorithm. This can induce high CPU consumption and accumulate
 excessive data in the database of such instances, resulting in a denial of
 service. Servers in private federations, or those that do not federate, are
 not affected. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.105.1 or later.
 Some workarounds are available. One can ban the malicious users or ACL
 block servers from the rooms and/or leave the room and purge the room using
 the admin API.
