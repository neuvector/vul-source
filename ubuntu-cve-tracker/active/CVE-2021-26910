Description:
 Firejail before 0.9.64.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions because there is a TOCTOU race condition between a stat
 operation and an OverlayFS mount operation.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Roman Fiedler discovered that a race condition existed in Firejail
 when using OverlayFS to prevent writes to the underlying file system. A
 local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. Note:
 this update disables support for OverlayFS in Firejail.
