Description:
 go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure
 Go. A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git
 versions prior to v5.13. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform
 denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a
 Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients. Users
 running versions of go-git from v4 and above are recommended to upgrade to
 v5.13 in order to mitigate this vulnerability.
