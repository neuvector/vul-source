Description:
 libheif is an HEIF and AVIF file format decoder and encoder. Prior to
 version 1.21.0, a crafted HEIF that exercises the overlay image item path
 triggers a heap buffer over-read in `HeifPixelImage::overlay()`. The
 function computes a negative row length (likely from an unclipped overlay
 rectangle or invalid offsets), which then underflows when converted to
 `size_t` and is passed to `memcpy`, causing a very large read past the end
 of the source plane and a crash. Version 1.21.0 contains a patch. As a
 workaround, avoid decoding images using `iovl` overlay boxes.
