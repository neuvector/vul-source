Description:
 The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud
 Server. Starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 3.6.5, a malicious
 server administrator can gain full access to an end-to-end encrypted
 folder. They can decrypt files, recover the folder structure, and add new
 files.​ Users should upgrade the Nextcloud Desktop client to 3.6.5 to
 receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.
