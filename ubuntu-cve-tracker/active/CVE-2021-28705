Description:
 issues with partially successful P2M updates on x86 T[his CNA information
 record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which
 aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] x86 HVM and PVH guests
 may be started in populate-on-demand (PoD) mode, to provide a way for them
 to later easily have more memory assigned. Guests are permitted to control
 certain P2M aspects of individual pages via hypercalls. These hypercalls
 may act on ranges of pages specified via page orders (resulting in a
 power-of-2 number of pages). In some cases the hypervisor carries out the
 requests by splitting them into smaller chunks. Error handling in certain
 PoD cases has been insufficient in that in particular partial success of
 some operations was not properly accounted for. There are two code paths
 affected - page removal (CVE-2021-28705) and insertion of new pages
 (CVE-2021-28709). (We provide one patch which combines the fix to both
 issues.)
