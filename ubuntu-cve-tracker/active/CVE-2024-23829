Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minor
 differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling
 to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against
 injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger
 exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other
 malformed input.  Being more lenient than internet standards require could,
 depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling. The
 unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the
 application server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability exists
 due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-47627. Version 3.9.2 fixes this
 vulnerability.
