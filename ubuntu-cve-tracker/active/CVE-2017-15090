Description:
 An issue has been found in the DNSSEC validation component of PowerDNS
 Recursor from 4.0.0 and up to and including 4.0.6, where the signatures
 might have been accepted as valid even if the signed data was not in
 bailiwick of the DNSKEY used to sign it. This allows an attacker in
 position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of records by issuing a
 valid signature for the crafted records.
