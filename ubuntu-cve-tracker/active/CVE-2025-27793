Description:
 Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving,
 and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version
 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions prior to version 5.17.0, users
 running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected JavaScript
 code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the
 `vega-interpreter`. Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0
 fix the issue. As a workaround, use `vega` with expression interpreter.
