Description:
 An insecure-credentials flaw was found in all openstack-cinder versions
 before openstack-cinder 14.1.0, all openstack-cinder 15.x.x versions before
 openstack-cinder 15.2.0 and all openstack-cinder 16.x.x versions before
 openstack-cinder 16.1.0. When using openstack-cinder with the Dell EMC
 ScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend storage driver, credentials for the entire
 backend are exposed in the ``connection_info`` element in all Block Storage
 v3 Attachments API calls containing that element. This flaw enables an
 end-user to create a volume, make an API call to show the attachment detail
 information, and retrieve a username and password that may be used to
 connect to another user's volume. Additionally, these credentials are valid
 for the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Management API, should an attacker discover
 the Management API endpoint. Source: OpenStack project
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Fixing this moves VxFlex OS passwords from the
 mdeslaur> block_device_mapping table to a file called
 mdeslaur> /opt/emc/scaleio/openstack/connector.conf
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> From python-os-brick patch:
 mdeslaur> It requires that a configuration file be deployed on compute
 mdeslaur> nodes, cinder nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume
 mdeslaur> attachment in your deployment, when using Cinder with a Dell
 mdeslaur> EMC VxFlex OS backend.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> If we fix this in stable releases, it will break environments
 mdeslaur> until the new configuration file is deployed.
