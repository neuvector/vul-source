Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Moodle which exists due to insufficient
 validation of the HTTP request origin in course redirect URL. A user's CSRF
 token was unnecessarily included in the URL when being redirected to a
 course they have just restored. A remote attacker can trick the victim to
 visit a specially crafted web page and perform arbitrary actions on behalf
 of the victim on the vulnerable website. This flaw allows an attacker to
 perform cross-site request forgery attacks.
