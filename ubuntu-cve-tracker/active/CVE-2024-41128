Description:
 Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests.
 Starting in version 3.1.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1,
 and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter
 filtering routines of Action Dispatch. Carefully crafted query parameters
 can cause query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount of time,
 possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected
 release should either upgrade to version 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or
 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. One may use Ruby 3.2 as a
 workaround. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails
 applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1
 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.
