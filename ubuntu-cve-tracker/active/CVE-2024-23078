 the component
 org.jgrapht.alg.util.ToleranceDoubleComparator::compare(Double, Double).
 NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not
 reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The
 submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust
 for vulnerability identification.
