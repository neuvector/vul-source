Description:
 A flaw was found in ofono, an Open Source Telephony on Linux. A stack
 overflow bug is triggered within the decode_status_report() function during
 the SMS decoding. It is assumed that the attack scenario is accessible from
 a compromised modem, a malicious base station, or just SMS. There is a
 bound check for this memcpy length in decode_submit(), but it was forgotten
 in decode_status_report().
