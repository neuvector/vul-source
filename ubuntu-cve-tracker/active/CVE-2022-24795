Description:
 yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library.
 The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow
 which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large
 (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the
 `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of
 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of
 buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t`
 in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from
 triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue
 triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent
 population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original
 buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly
 impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for
 arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated
 to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large
 inputs to YAJL.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> CVE is assigned to yajl-ruby. There is an unofficial patch for
 mdeslaur> yajl which will abort() too, though that is likely hardening and
 mdeslaur> isn't part of this CVE.
 ccdm94> no upstream patch available as of 2023-06-07 for yajl. There is an
 ccdm94> open pull request for the unofficial patch, however, the fix proposed 
 ccdm94> by the patch is being further discussed on the comments of this pull
 ccdm94> request. The unofficial patch is being rejected by some, and new 
 ccdm94> patches have been proposed. More information at 
 ccdm94> https://github.com/lloyd/yajl/pull/240.
