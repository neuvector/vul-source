Description:
 In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 ->
 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition,
 as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development
 branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version
 and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses
 BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a
 server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the
 tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options.
 Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is
 frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as
 in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active
 Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the
 ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on
 the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled
 for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read,
 leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit
 platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer
 overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have
 determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT
 and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating
 systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete.
 Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing
 the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16
 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove
 something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since
 system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an
 exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.
