Description:
 FontForge GUtils SGI File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code on affected installations of FontForge. User
 interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
 must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of scanlines within SGI files.
 The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of
 user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker
 can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the
 current process. Was ZDI-CAN-27920.
