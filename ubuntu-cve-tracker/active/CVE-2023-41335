Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
 Matrix.org Foundation. When users update their passwords, the new
 credentials may be briefly held in the server database. While this doesn't
 grant the server any added capabilities—it already learns the users'
 passwords as part of the authentication process—it does disrupt the
 expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a result,
 these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups for a
 longer duration. These temporarily stored passwords are automatically
 erased after a 48-hour window. This issue has been addressed in version
 1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
 this issue.
