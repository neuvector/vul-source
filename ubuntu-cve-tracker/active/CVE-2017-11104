Description:
 Knot DNS before 2.4.5 and 2.5.x before 2.5.2 contains a flaw within the
 TSIG protocol implementation that would allow an attacker with a valid key
 name and algorithm to bypass TSIG authentication if no additional ACL
 restrictions are set, because of an improper TSIG validity period check.
