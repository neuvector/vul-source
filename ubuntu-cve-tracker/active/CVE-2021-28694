Description:
 IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to
 multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond
 to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of
 memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these
 addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are
 typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to
 apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such
 regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings
 (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified
 by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be
 identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon
 de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would
 be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory
 which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).
