Description:
 The daemon in GDM through 3.29.1 does not properly unexport display objects
 from its D-Bus interface when they are destroyed, which allows a local
 attacker to trigger a use-after-free via a specially crafted sequence of
 D-Bus method calls, resulting in a denial of service or potential code
 execution.
