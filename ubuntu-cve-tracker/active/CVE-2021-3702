Description:
 A race condition flaw was found in ansible-runner, where an attacker could
 watch for rapid creation and deletion of a temporary directory, substitute
 their directory at that name, and then have access to ansible-runner's
 private_data_dir the next time ansible-runner made use of the
 private_data_dir. The highest Threat out of this flaw is to integrity and
 confidentiality.
