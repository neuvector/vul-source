Description:
 gorilla/schema converts structs to and from form values. Prior to version
 1.4.1 Running `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct that has a field of
 type `[]struct{...}` opens it up to malicious attacks regarding memory
 allocations, taking advantage of the sparse slice functionality. Any use of
 `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with arrays of other structs could be
 vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. Version 1.4.1 contains
 a patch for the issue.
