Description:
 In ImfChromaticities.cpp routine RGBtoXYZ(), there are some division
 operations such as `float Z = (1 - chroma.white.x - chroma.white.y) * Y /
 chroma.white.y;` and `chroma.green.y * (X + Z))) / d;` but the divisor is
 not checked for a 0 value. A specially crafted file could trigger a
 divide-by-zero condition which could affect the availability of programs
 linked with OpenEXR.
