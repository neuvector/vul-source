Description:
 SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. Starting
 version 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if the
 destination file is under destination directory. However, it is not
 enforced that `destDir` ends with slash. If the `destDir` is not slash
 terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a
 name thats begins with the destination directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`.
 Because of the file name and destination directory constraints, the
 arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case.
 Version 1.3.3 contains a patch for this vulnerability.
