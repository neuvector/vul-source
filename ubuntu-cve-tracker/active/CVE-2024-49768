Description:
 Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. A
 remote client may send a request that is exactly recv_bytes (defaults to
 8192) long, followed by a secondary request using HTTP pipelining. When
 request lookahead is disabled (default) we won't read any more requests,
 and when the first request fails due to a parsing error, we simply close
 the connection. However when request lookahead is enabled, it is possible
 to process and receive the first request, start sending the error message
 back to the client while we read the next request and queue it. This will
 allow the secondary request to be serviced by the worker thread while the
 connection should be closed. Waitress 3.0.1 fixes the race condition. As a
 workaround, disable channel_request_lookahead, this is set to 0 by default
 disabling this feature.
