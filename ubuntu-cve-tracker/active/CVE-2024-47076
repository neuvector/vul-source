Description:
 CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and
 `libcupsfilters` contains the code of the filters of the former
 `cups-filters` package as library functions to be used for the data format
 conversion tasks needed in Printer Applications. The
 `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize
 IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are
 used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker
 controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system.
