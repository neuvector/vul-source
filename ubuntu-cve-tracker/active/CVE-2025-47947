Description:
 ModSecurity is an open source, cross platform web application firewall
 (WAF) engine for Apache, IIS and Nginx. Versions up to and including 2.9.8
 are vulnerable to denial of service in one special case (in stable released
 versions): when the payload's content type is `application/json`, and there
 is at least one rule which does a `sanitiseMatchedBytes` action. A patch is
 available at pull request 3389 and expected to be part of version 2.9.9. No
 known workarounds are available.
