Description:
 Jawn is an open source JSON parser. Extenders of the
 `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade`
 who don't override `objectContext()` are vulnerable to a hash collision
 attack which may result in a denial of service. Most applications do not
 implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library.
 `jawn-parser-1.3.1` fixes this issue and users are advised to upgrade. For
 users unable to upgrade override `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe
 collection.
