Description:
 Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit.
 In Asterisk prior to versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1, as well as
 certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6, it is possible to read any
 arbitrary file even when the `live_dangerously` is not enabled. This allows
 arbitrary files to be read. Asterisk versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1,
 as well as certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6, contain a fix for this
 issue.
