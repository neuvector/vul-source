Description:
 Gunicorn fails to properly validate Transfer-Encoding headers, leading to
 HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) vulnerabilities. By crafting requests with
 conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, attackers can bypass security
 restrictions and access restricted endpoints. This issue is due to
 Gunicorn's handling of Transfer-Encoding headers, where it incorrectly
 processes requests with multiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers,
 treating them as chunked regardless of the final encoding specified. This
 vulnerability allows for a range of attacks including cache poisoning,
 session manipulation, and data exposure.
