 https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt/issues/668
Description:
 ruby-jwt v3.0.0.beta1 was discovered to contain weak encryption. NOTE: the
 Supplier's perspective is "keysize is not something that is enforced by
 this library. Currently more recent versions of OpenSSL are enforcing some
 key sizes and those restrictions apply to the users of this gem also."
