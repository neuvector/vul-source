Description:
 An integer overflow flaw, which could lead to an out of bounds write, was
 discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way keyboard prompt requests are
 parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to
 execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled prompt requests. A
 remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.
