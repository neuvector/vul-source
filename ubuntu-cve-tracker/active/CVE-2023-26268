Description:
 Design documents with matching document IDs, from databases on the same
 cluster, may share a mutable Javascript environment when using these design
 document functions:
   *  validate_doc_update
 
   *  list
 
   *  filter
 
   *  filter views (using view functions as filters)
 
   *  rewrite
 
   *  update
 
 This doesn't affect map/reduce or search (Dreyfus) index functions.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to a version that is no longer affected by
 this issue (Apache CouchDB 3.3.2 or 3.2.3).
 
 Workaround: Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may
 attempt to cache or store data in the Javascript environment.
