Description:
 Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. Prior to `puma`
 version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body.
 Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being
 closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work
 correctly. The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the
 body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage. This
 problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11. This problem is fixed
 in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2. Upgrading to a
 patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the vulnerability.
