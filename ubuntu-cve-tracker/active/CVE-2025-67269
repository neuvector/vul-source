Description:
 An integer underflow vulnerability exists in the `nextstate()` function in
 `gpsd/packet.c` of gpsd versions prior to commit
 `ffa1d6f40bca0b035fc7f5e563160ebb67199da7`. When parsing a NAVCOM packet,
 the payload length is calculated using `lexer->length = (size_t)c - 4`
 without checking if the input byte `c` is less than 4. This results in an
 unsigned integer underflow, setting `lexer->length` to a very large value
 (near `SIZE_MAX`). The parser then enters a loop attempting to consume this
 massive number of bytes, causing 100% CPU utilization and a Denial of
 Service (DoS) condition.
