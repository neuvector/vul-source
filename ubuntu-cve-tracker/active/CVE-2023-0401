Description:
 A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on
 PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used
 for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of
 the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail.
 There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization
 function which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely
 leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by
 using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not
 loading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library
 calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation
 in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications
 would be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on
 untrusted data.
