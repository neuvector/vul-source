Description:
 PCI devices can make use of a functionality called phantom functions, that
 when enabled allows the device to generate requests using the IDs of
 functions that are otherwise unpopulated. This allows a device to extend
 the number of outstanding requests. Such phantom functions need an IOMMU
 context setup, but failure to setup the context is not fatal when the
 device is assigned. Not failing device assignment when such failure happens
 can lead to the primary device being assigned to a guest, while some of the
 phantom functions are assigned to a different domain.
