Description:
 A heap out of bounds read vulnerability exists in the OpenImageIO
 master-branch-9aeece7a when parsing the image file directory part of a PSD
 image file. A specially-crafted .psd file can cause a read of arbitrary
 memory address which can lead to denial of service. An attacker can provide
 a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.
