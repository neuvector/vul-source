Description:
 urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Starting in
 version 1.0 and prior to 2.6.0, the Streaming API improperly handles highly
 compressed data. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient
 handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather
 than loading the entire response body into memory at once. When streaming a
 compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on
 the HTTP Content-Encoding header (e.g., gzip, deflate, br, or zstd). The
 library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until
 the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that
 exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next
 read operation. The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode
 a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can
 result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory
 allocation for the decompressed data.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3 binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-urllib3 is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
