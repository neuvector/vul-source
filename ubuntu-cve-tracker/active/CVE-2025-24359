Description:
 ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to
 version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval`
 library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary
 Python code in the context of the application using the library. The
 vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of
 `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value
 uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an
 attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call
 `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to
 access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError`
 exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj`
 attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object
 properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.
