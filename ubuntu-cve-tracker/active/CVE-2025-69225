Description:
 AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. Versions 3.13.2 and below contain parser logic which allows
 non-ASCII decimals to be present in the Range header. There is no known
 impact, but there is the possibility that there's a method to exploit a
 request smuggling vulnerability. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.
