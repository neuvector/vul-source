Description:
 wolfSSL SP Math All RSA implementation is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack,
 new variation of a timing Bleichenbacher style attack, when built with the
 following options to configure:
 
 --enable-all CFLAGS="-DWOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA"
 
 The define “WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA” enables static RSA cipher suites, which is
 not recommended, and has been disabled by default since wolfSSL 3.6.6. 
 Therefore the default build since 3.6.6, even with "--enable-all", is not
 vulnerable to the Marvin Attack. The vulnerability is specific to static
 RSA cipher suites, and expected to be padding-independent.
 
 The vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt ciphertexts and forge
 signatures after probing with a large number of test observations. However
 the server’s private key is not exposed.
