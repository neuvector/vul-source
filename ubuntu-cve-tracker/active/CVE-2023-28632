Description:
 GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in
 version 0.83 and prior to versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7, an authenticated user
 can modify emails of any user, and can therefore takeover another user
 account through the "forgotten password" feature. By modifying emails, the
 user can also receive sensitive data through GLPI notifications. Versions
 9.5.13 and 10.0.7 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, account
 takeover can be prevented by deactivating all notifications related to
 `Forgotten password?` event. However, it will not prevent unauthorized
 modification of any user emails.
