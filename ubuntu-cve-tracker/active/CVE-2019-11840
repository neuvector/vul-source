Description:
 An issue was discovered in the supplementary Go cryptography library,
 golang.org/x/crypto, before v0.0.0-20190320223903-b7391e95e576. A flaw was
 found in the amd64 implementation of the golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20 and
 golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa packages. If more than 256 GiB of
 keystream is generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32
 bits, the amd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output, and
 then cycle back to previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes
 can lead to loss of confidentiality in encryption applications, or to
 predictability in CSPRNG applications.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> snapd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto with the
  affected code
 jdstrand> snapd doesn't import/use the salsa code directly, but does vendor
  golang-gopkg-macaroon.v1, which imports golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox
  which does import salsa and contains the affected salsa2020XORKeyStream.
  snapd uses secretbox.Open() and secretbox.Seal(), both of which use
  salsa.XORKeyStream() (which wraps salsa2020XORKeyStream) via the internal
  decrypt() and encrypt() functions, respectively. In macaroon.v1, encrypt() is
  only used via AddThirdPartyCaveat() and decrypt() via Verify().
  .
  overlord/auth/auth.go in snapd uses Verify() in CheckMacaroon(),
  daemon/api.go uses CheckMacaroon() in UserFromRequest(), which is called by
  ServeHTTP(), the service used to process snap commands from the local system
  to the local snapd. This CVE does not affect decrypt() operations.
  .
  AddThirdPartyCaveat() is only used in unit tests, but not in the binaries of
  snapd builds.
  .
  For snapd, ignoring since only encryption operations (ie, secretbox.Seal())
  are affected with regard to loss of confidentiality/predictability and this
  function is only ever (ultimately) called via the snapd unit tests.
 jdstrand> lxd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto, but does not
  import golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox or salsa. lxd in cosmic and later
  does not contain the affected code.
