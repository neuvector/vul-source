Description:
 In scrapy version 2.10.1, an issue was identified where the Authorization
 header, containing credentials for server authentication, is leaked to a
 third-party site during a cross-domain redirect. This vulnerability arises
 from the failure to remove the Authorization header when redirecting across
 domains. The exposure of the Authorization header to unauthorized actors
 could potentially allow for account hijacking.
