Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the generate report
 functionality in Rarlab WinRAR 7.11, allows attackers to disclose user
 information such as the computer username, generated report directory, and
 IP address. The generate report command includes archived file names
 without validation in the HTML report, which allows potentially malicious
 HTML tags to be injected into the report. User interaction is required.
 User must use the "generate report" functionality and open the report.
