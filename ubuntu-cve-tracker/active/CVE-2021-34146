Description:
 The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress CYW920735Q60EVB does
 not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses,
 allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service and
 restart (crash) of the device by flooding it with LMP_AU_Rand packets after
 the paging procedure.
