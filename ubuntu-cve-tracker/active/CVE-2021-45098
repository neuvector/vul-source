Description:
 An issue was discovered in Suricata before 6.0.4. It is possible to
 bypass/evade any HTTP-based signature by faking an RST TCP packet with
 random TCP options of the md5header from the client side. After the
 three-way handshake, it's possible to inject an RST ACK with a random TCP
 md5header option. Then, the client can send an HTTP GET request with a
 forbidden URL. The server will ignore the RST ACK and send the response
 HTTP packet for the client's request. These packets will not trigger a
 Suricata reject action.
