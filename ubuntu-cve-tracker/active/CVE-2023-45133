Description:
 Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to
 versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`,
 using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker
 can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins
 that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel
 methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`;
 `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any "polyfill
 provider" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`,
 such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`,
 `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No
 other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party
 plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted.
 The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and
 `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse`
 and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade
 them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path
 in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`
 v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2,
 `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3,
 `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`
 v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0,
 `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.
