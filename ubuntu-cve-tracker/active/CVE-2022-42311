Description:
 Xenstore: guests can let run xenstored out of memory T[his CNA information
 record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which
 aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Malicious guests can
 cause xenstored to allocate vast amounts of memory, eventually resulting in
 a Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored. There are multiple ways how guests
 can cause large memory allocations in xenstored: - - by issuing new
 requests to xenstored without reading the responses, causing the responses
 to be buffered in memory - - by causing large number of watch events to be
 generated via setting up multiple xenstore watches and then e.g. deleting
 many xenstore nodes below the watched path - - by creating as many nodes as
 allowed with the maximum allowed size and path length in as many
 transactions as possible - - by accessing many nodes inside a transaction
