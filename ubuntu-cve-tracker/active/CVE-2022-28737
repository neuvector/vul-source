Description:
 There's a possible overflow in handle_image() when shim tries to load and
 execute crafted EFI executables; The handle_image() function takes into
 account the SizeOfRawData field from each section to be loaded. An attacker
 can leverage this to perform out-of-bound writes into memory. Arbitrary
 code execution is not discarded in such scenario.
