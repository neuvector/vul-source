Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. The
 vulnerability impacts Grafana instances with several organizations, and
 allows a user with Organization Admin permissions in one organization to
 change the permissions associated with Organization Viewer, Organization
 Editor and Organization Admin roles in all organizations. It also allows an
 Organization Admin to assign or revoke any permissions that they have to
 any user globally. This means that any Organization Admin can elevate their
 own permissions in any organization that they are already a member of, or
 elevate or restrict the permissions of any other user. The vulnerability
 does not allow a user to become a member of an organization that they are
 not already a member of, or to add any other users to an organization that
 the current user is not a member of.
