Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. The
 vulnerability impacts Grafana instances with several organizations, and
 allows a user with Organization Admin permissions in one organization to
 change the permissions associated with Organization Viewer, Organization
 Editor and Organization Admin roles in all organizations.
 
 It also allows an Organization Admin to assign or revoke any permissions
 that they have to any user globally.
 
 This means that any Organization Admin can elevate their own permissions in
 any organization that they are already a member of, or elevate or restrict
 the permissions of any other user.
 
 The vulnerability does not allow a user to become a member of an
 organization that they are not already a member of, or to add any other
 users to an organization that the current user is not a member of.
