Description:
 stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. The
 stbi__getn function reads a specified number of bytes from context
 (typically a file) into the specified buffer. In case the file stream
 points to the end, it returns zero. There are two places where its return
 value is not checked: In the `stbi__hdr_load` function and in the
 `stbi__tga_load` function. The latter of the two is likely more exploitable
 as an attacker may also control the size of an uninitialized buffer.
