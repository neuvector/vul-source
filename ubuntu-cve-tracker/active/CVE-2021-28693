Description:
 xen/arm: Boot modules are not scrubbed The bootloader will load boot
 modules (e.g. kernel, initramfs...) in a temporary area before they are
 copied by Xen to each domain memory. To ensure sensitive data is not leaked
 from the modules, Xen must "scrub" them before handing the page over to the
 allocator. Unfortunately, it was discovered that modules will not be
 scrubbed on Arm.
