Description:
 In wolfSSL release 5.8.2 blinding support is turned on by default for
 Curve25519 in applicable builds. The blinding configure option is only for
 the base C implementation of Curve25519. It is not needed, or available
 with; ARM assembly builds, Intel assembly builds, and the small Curve25519
 feature. While the side-channel attack on extracting a private key would be
 very difficult to execute in practice, enabling blinding provides an
 additional layer of protection for devices that may be more susceptible to
 physical access or side-channel observation.
