Description:
 Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of
 Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling
 or runtimes. In 26.0.0, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces,
 including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container
 with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to
 share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this
 direct access, (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts
 on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses, (2) if router
 advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may
 get SLAAC-assigned addresses, and (3) the interface will be a member of
 IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present
 an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is
 patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use
 `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or
 `docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file.
