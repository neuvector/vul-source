Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** It was discovered freeradius up to and including version
 3.0.19 does not correctly configure logrotate, allowing a local attacker
 who already has control of the radiusd user to escalate his privileges to
 root, by tricking logrotate into writing a radiusd-writable file to a
 directory normally inaccessible by the radiusd user. NOTE: the upstream
 software maintainer has stated "there is simply no way for anyone to gain
 privileges through this alleged issue."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 leosilva> following the discussion from upstream..this issue
 leosilva> doesn't seems to be a security one. For now
 leosilva> moving it to low priority.
 mdeslaur> While upstream has disputed this issue, a user able to escalate
 mdeslaur> to the radiusd user may be able to escalate to root using this
 mdeslaur> issue. While low priority, it should still be looked at.
 mdeslaur> There is a proposed patch in the Debian bug.
