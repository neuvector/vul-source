Description:
 Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cache for a given
 region. This is, for instance, used when allocating guest memory to ensure
 any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached memory before
 handing over the page to a guest. Unfortunately, the arithmetics in the
 helpers can overflow and would then result to skip the cache
 cleaning/invalidation. Therefore there is no guarantee when all the writes
 will reach the memory.
