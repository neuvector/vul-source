Description:
 An issue was discovered in TrouSerS through 0.3.14. If the tcsd daemon is
 started with root privileges instead of by the tss user, it fails to drop
 the root gid privilege when no longer needed.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the Debian/Ubuntu package starts tcsd as the tss user, not as
 mdeslaur> root, so this issue doesn't affect default configurations
