Description:
 inappropriate x86 IOMMU timeout detection / handling IOMMUs process
 commands issued to them in parallel with the operation of the CPU(s)
 issuing such commands. In the current implementation in Xen, asynchronous
 notification of the completion of such commands is not used. Instead, the
 issuing CPU spin-waits for the completion of the most recently issued
 command(s). Some of these waiting loops try to apply a timeout to fail
 overly-slow commands. The course of action upon a perceived timeout
 actually being detected is inappropriate: - on Intel hardware guests which
 did not originally cause the timeout may be marked as crashed, - on AMD
 hardware higher layer callers would not be notified of the issue, making
 them continue as if the IOMMU operation succeeded.
