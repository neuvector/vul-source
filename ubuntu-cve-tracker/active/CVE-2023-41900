Description:
 Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Versions 9.4.21
 through 9.4.51, 10.0.15, and 11.0.15 are vulnerable to weak authentication.
 If a Jetty `OpenIdAuthenticator` uses the optional nested `LoginService`,
 and that `LoginService` decides to revoke an already authenticated user,
 then the current request will still treat the user as authenticated. The
 authentication is then cleared from the session and subsequent requests
 will not be treated as authenticated. So a request on a previously
 authenticated session could be allowed to bypass authentication after it
 had been rejected by the `LoginService`. This impacts usages of the
 jetty-openid which have configured a nested `LoginService` and where that
 `LoginService` will is capable of rejecting previously authenticated users.
 Versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, and 11.0.16 have a patch for this issue.
