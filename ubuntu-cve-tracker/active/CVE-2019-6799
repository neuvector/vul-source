Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin before 4.8.5. When the
 AllowArbitraryServer configuration setting is set to true, with the use of
 a rogue MySQL server, an attacker can read any file on the server that the
 web server's user can access. This is related to the
 mysql.allow_local_infile PHP configuration, and the inadvertent ignoring of
 "options(MYSQLI_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE" calls.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that phpMyAdmin would allow sensitive files to be leaked if
 certain configuration options were set. An attacker could use this
 vulnerability to access confidential information.
