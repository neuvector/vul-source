Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x
 prior to 2.7.17, 2.8.9 and 2.9.6 respectively, when using ansible_facts as
 a subkey of itself and promoting it to a variable when inject is enabled,
 overwriting the ansible_facts after the clean. An attacker could take
 advantage of this by altering the ansible_facts, such as ansible_hosts,
 users and any other key data which would lead into privilege escalation or
 code injection.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 john-breton> Versions prior to 2.5 did not have RESTRICTED_RESULT_KEYS, 
 john-breton> making a fix very intrusive and likely infeasible.
