Description:
 Bouncy Castle for Java before 1.73 contains a potential Denial of Service
 (DoS) issue within the Bouncy Castle org.bouncycastle.openssl.PEMParser
 class. This class parses OpenSSL PEM encoded streams containing X.509
 certificates, PKCS8 encoded keys, and PKCS7 objects. Parsing a file that
 has crafted ASN.1 data through the PEMParser causes an OutOfMemoryError,
 which can enable a denial of service attack. (For users of the FIPS Java
 API: BC-FJA 1.0.2.3 and earlier are affected; BC-FJA 1.0.2.4 is fixed.)
