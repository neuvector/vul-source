Description:
 Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or
 fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from
 the remote Git process to the client via the so-called "sideband channel".
 These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed directly to the
 standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected
 to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not
 protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can
 be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to
 mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the
 git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public
 mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable
 to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted
 sources.
