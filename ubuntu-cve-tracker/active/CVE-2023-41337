Description:
 h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. In
 version 2.3.0-beta2 and prior, when h2o is configured to listen to multiple
 addresses or ports with each of them using different backend servers
 managed by multiple entities, a malicious backend entity that also has the
 opportunity to observe or inject packets exchanged between the client and
 h2o may misdirect HTTPS requests going to other backends and observe the
 contents of that HTTPS request being sent. The attack involves a victim
 client trying to resume a TLS connection and an attacker redirecting the
 packets to a different address or port than that intended by the client.
 The attacker must already have been configured by the administrator of h2o
 to act as a backend to one of the addresses or ports that the h2o instance
 listens to. Session IDs and tickets generated by h2o are not bound to
 information specific to the server address, port, or the X.509 certificate,
 and therefore it is possible for an attacker to force the victim connection
 to wrongfully resume against a different server address or port on which
 the same h2o instance is listening. Once a TLS session is misdirected to
 resume to a server address / port that is configured to use an
 attacker-controlled server as the backend, depending on the configuration,
 HTTPS requests from the victim client may be forwarded to the attacker's
 server. An H2O instance is vulnerable to this attack only if the instance
 is configured to listen to different addresses or ports using the listen
 directive at the host level and the instance is configured to connect to
 backend servers managed by multiple entities. A patch is available at
 commit 35760540337a47e5150da0f4a66a609fad2ef0ab. As a workaround, one may
 stop using using host-level listen directives in favor of global-level
 ones.
