Description:
 An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adnshost mishandles a missing
 final newline on a stdin read. It is wrong to increment used as well as
 setting r, since used is incremented according to r, later. Rather one
 should be doing what read() would have done. Without this fix, adnshost may
 read and process one byte beyond the buffer, perhaps crashing or perhaps
 somehow leaking the value of that byte.
