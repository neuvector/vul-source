Description:
 In Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC before 1.61 and BC-FJA before 1.0.1.2,
 attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private exponent because
 of Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs. This occurs in
 org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding. Sending invalid ciphertext
 that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP Decoder could result in the
 throwing of an early exception, potentially leaking some information about
 the private exponent of the RSA private key performing the encryption.
