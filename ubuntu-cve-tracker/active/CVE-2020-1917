Description:
 xbuf_format_converter, used as part of exif_read_data, was appending a
 terminating null character to the generated string, but was not using its
 standard append char function. As a result, if the buffer was full, it
 would result in an out-of-bounds write. This issue affects HHVM versions
 prior to 4.56.3, all versions between 4.57.0 and 4.80.1, all versions
 between 4.81.0 and 4.93.1, and versions 4.94.0, 4.95.0, 4.96.0, 4.97.0,
 4.98.0.
