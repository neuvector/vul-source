Description:
 Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If
 you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider
 attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your
 credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by
 Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the
 `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through
 redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain`
 spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the
 configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or
 a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may
 upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP
 authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the
 `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a
 value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request,
 instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.
