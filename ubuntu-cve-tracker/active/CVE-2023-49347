Description:
 Temporary data passed between application components by Budgie Extras
 Windows Previews could potentially be viewed or manipulated. The data is
 stored in a location that is accessible to any user who has local access to
 the system. Attackers may read private information from windows, present
 false information to users, or deny access to the application.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Matthias Gerstner discovered that the Windows Previews application of

 information, or deny access to the application.
