Description:
 Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Jackrabbit Core
 and Apache Jackrabbit JCR Commons.
 
 This issue affects Apache Jackrabbit Core: from 1.0.0 through 2.22.1;
 Apache Jackrabbit JCR Commons: from 1.0.0 through 2.22.1.
 
 Deployments that accept JNDI URIs for JCR lookup from untrusted users
 allows them to inject malicious JNDI references, potentially leading to
 arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data.
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.22.2. JCR lookup through JNDI
 has been disabled by default in 2.22.2. Users of this feature need to
 enable it explicitly and are adviced to review their use of JNDI URI for
 JCR lookup.
