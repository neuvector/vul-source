Description:
 A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was found in
 Moodle. This flaw exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
 input in LTI provider library. The library does not utilise Moodle's
 inbuilt cURL helper, which resulted in a blind SSRF risk. An attacker can
 send a specially crafted HTTP request and trick the application to initiate
 requests to arbitrary systems. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker
 to perform SSRF attacks.
