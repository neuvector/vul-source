Description:
 zlib versions up to and including 1.3.1.2 contain a global buffer overflow
 in the untgz utility. The TGZfname() function copies an attacker-supplied
 archive name from argv[] into a fixed-size 1024-byte static global buffer
 using an unbounded strcpy() call without length validation. Supplying an
 archive name longer than 1024 bytes results in an out-of-bounds write that
 can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, and potentially code
 execution depending on compiler, build flags, architecture, and memory
 layout. The overflow occurs prior to any archive parsing or validation.
