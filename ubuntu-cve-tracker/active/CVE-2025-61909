Description:
 Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system. From 2.10.0 to before 2.15.1,
 2.14.7, and 2.13.13, the safe-reload script (also used during systemctl
 reload icinga2) and logrotate configuration shipped with Icinga 2 read the
 PID of the main Icinga 2 process from a PID file writable by the daemon
 user, but send the signal as the root user. This can allow the Icinga user
 to send signals to processes it would otherwise not permitted to. A fix is
 included in the following Icinga 2 versions: 2.15.1, 2.14.7, and 2.13.13.
