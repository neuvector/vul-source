Description:
 The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED BT stack through
 2.9.0 for CYW20735B1 does not properly handle the reception of a malformed
 LMP timing accuracy response followed by multiple reconnections to the link
 slave, allowing attackers to exhaust device BT resources and eventually
 trigger a crash via multiple attempts of sending a crafted LMP timing
 accuracy response followed by a sudden reconnection with a random
 BDAddress.
