Description:
 RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. In affected
 versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI obfuscation in their
 worker (link) state. The encryption key used to encrypt the URI was seeded
 with a predictable secret. This means that in case of certain exceptions
 related to Shovel and Federation plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable
 data could appear in the node log. Patched versions correctly use a
 cluster-wide secret for that purpose. This issue has been addressed and
 Patched versions: `3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable
 to upgrade should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.
