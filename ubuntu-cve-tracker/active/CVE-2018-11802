Description:
 In Apache Solr, the cluster can be partitioned into multiple collections
 and only a subset of nodes actually host any given collection. However, if
 a node receives a request for a collection it does not host, it proxies the
 request to a relevant node and serves the request. Solr bypasses all
 authorization settings for such requests. This affects all Solr versions
 prior to 7.7 that use the default authorization mechanism of Solr
 (RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin).
