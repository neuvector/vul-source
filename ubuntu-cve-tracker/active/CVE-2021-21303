Description:
 Helm is open-source software which is essentially "The Kubernetes Package
 Manager". Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of
 pre-configured Kubernetes resources. In Helm from version 3.0 and before
 version 3.5.2, there a few cases where data loaded from potentially
 untrusted sources was not properly sanitized. When a SemVer in the
 `version` field of a chart is invalid, in some cases Helm allows the string
 to be used "as is" without sanitizing. Helm fails to properly sanitized
 some fields present on Helm repository `index.yaml` files. Helm does not
 properly sanitized some fields in the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins In
 some cases, Helm does not properly sanitize the fields in the `Chart.yaml`
 file. By exploiting these attack vectors, core maintainers were able to
 send deceptive information to a terminal screen running the `helm` command,
 as well as obscure or alter information on the screen. In some cases, we
 could send codes that terminals used to execute higher-order logic, like
 clearing a terminal screen. Further, during evaluation, the Helm
 maintainers discovered a few other fields that were not properly sanitized
 when read out of repository index files. This fix remedies all such cases,
 and once again enforces SemVer2 policies on version fields. All users of
 the Helm 3 should upgrade to the fixed version 3.5.2 or later. Those who
 use Helm as a library should verify that they either sanitize this data on
 their own, or use the proper Helm API calls to sanitize the data.
