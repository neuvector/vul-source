Description:
 Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.
 
 The fix for bug 60013 introduced a regression where the       rewritten URL
 was normalized before it was decoded. This introduced the       possibility
 that, for rewrite rules that rewrite query parameters to the       URL, an
 attacker could manipulate the request URI to bypass security     
 constraints including the protection for /WEB-INF/ and /META-INF/. If PUT
 requests were also enabled then malicious files could be uploaded leading
 to remote code execution. PUT requests are normally limited to trusted
 users and it is considered unlikely that PUT requests would be enabled in
 conjunction with a rewrite that manipulated the URI.
 
 
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.0.M11 through 9.0.108.
 
 The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are
 known to be affected: 8.5.6 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may
 also be affected.
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.11 or later, 10.1.45 or
 later or 9.0.109 or later, which fix the issue.
