Description:
 The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set
 bypass for HTTP multipart requests by submitting a payload that uses a
 character encoding scheme via the Content-Type or the deprecated
 Content-Transfer-Encoding multipart MIME header fields that will not be
 decoded and inspected by the web application firewall engine and the rule
 set. The multipart payload will therefore bypass detection. A vulnerable
 backend that supports these encoding schemes can potentially be exploited.
 The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the
 currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are
 advised upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively. The mitigation against
 these vulnerabilities depends on the installation of the latest ModSecurity
 version (v2.9.6 / v3.0.8).
