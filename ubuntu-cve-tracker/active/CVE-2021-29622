Description:
 Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system and time series database. In
 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a
 seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /. Due to a bug
 in the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL that can
 redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint. If a user visits a
 prometheus server with a specially crafted address, they can be redirected
 to an arbitrary URL. The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1
 releases. In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely. The
 workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of
 Prometheus.
