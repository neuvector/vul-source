Description:
 GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements
 NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, memory corruption can be
 triggered when decoding UTF16 strings. The variable `outlen` was not
 initialized and could cause writing a zero to an arbitrary place in memory
 if `ntlm_str_convert()` were to fail, which would leave `outlen`
 uninitialized. This can lead to a denial of service if the write hits
 unmapped memory or randomly corrupts a byte in the application memory
 space. This vulnerability can trigger an out-of-bounds write, leading to
 memory corruption. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main
 `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.
