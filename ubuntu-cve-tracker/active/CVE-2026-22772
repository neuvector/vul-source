Description:
 Fulcio is a certificate authority for issuing code signing certificates for
 an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity. Prior to 1.8.5, Fulcio's metaRegex()
 function uses unanchored regex, allowing attackers to bypass MetaIssuer URL
 validation and trigger SSRF to arbitrary internal services. Since the SSRF
 only can trigger GET requests, the request cannot mutate state. The
 response from the GET request is not returned to the caller so data
 exfiltration is not possible. A malicious actor could attempt to probe an
 internal network through Blind SSRF. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.5.
