Description:
 arm: guest_physmap_remove_page not removing the p2m mappings The functions
 to remove one or more entries from a guest p2m pagetable on Arm
 (p2m_remove_mapping, guest_physmap_remove_page, and p2m_set_entry with mfn
 set to INVALID_MFN) do not actually clear the pagetable entry if the entry
 doesn't have the valid bit set. It is possible to have a valid pagetable
 entry without the valid bit set when a guest operating system uses set/way
 cache maintenance instructions. For instance, a guest issuing a set/way
 cache maintenance instruction, then calling the XENMEM_decrease_reservation
 hypercall to give back memory pages to Xen, might be able to retain access
 to those pages even after Xen started reusing them for other purposes.
