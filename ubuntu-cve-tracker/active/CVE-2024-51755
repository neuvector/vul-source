Description:
 Twig is a template language for PHP. In a sandbox, an attacker can access
 attributes of Array-like objects as they were not checked by the security
 policy. They are now checked via the property policy and the `__isset()`
 method is now called after the security check. This is a BC break. This
 issue has been patched in versions 3.11.2 and 3.14.1. All users are advised
 to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
