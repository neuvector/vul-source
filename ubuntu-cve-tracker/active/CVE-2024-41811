Description:
 ipl/web is a set of common web components for php projects. Some of the
 recent development by Icinga is, under certain circumstances, susceptible
 to cross site request forgery. (CSRF). All affected products, in any
 version, will be unaffected by this once `icinga-php-library` is upgraded.
 Version 0.10.1 includes a fix for this. It will be published as part of the
 `icinga-php-library` v0.14.1 release.
