Description:
 When the library bridge feature is enabled, the clickhouse-library-bridge
 exposes an HTTP API on localhost. This allows clickhouse-server to
 dynamically load a library from a specified path and execute it in an
 isolated process. Combined with the ClickHouse table engine functionality
 that permits file uploads to specific directories, a misconfigured server
 can be exploited by an attacker with privilege to access to both table
 engines to execute arbitrary code on the ClickHouse server.
 
 You can check if your ClickHouse server is vulnerable to this vulnerability
 by inspecting the configuration file and confirming if the following
 setting is enabled:
 
 <library_bridge>
    <port>9019</port>
 </library_bridge>
