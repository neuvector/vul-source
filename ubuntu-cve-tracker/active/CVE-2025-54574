Description:
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In versions 6.3 and below, Squid is
 vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow and possible remote code execution
 attack when processing URN due to incorrect buffer management. This has
 been fixed in version 6.4. To work around this issue, disable URN access
 permissions.
