Description:
 HTTPRedirect.php in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp before 1.15.4 has an
 incorrect check of return values in the signature validation utilities,
 allowing an attacker to get invalid signatures accepted as valid by forcing
 an error during validation. This occurs because of a dependency on PHP
 functionality that interprets a -1 error code as a true boolean value.
