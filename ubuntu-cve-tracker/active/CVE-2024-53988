Description:
 rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails
 applications. There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain
 configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer 1.6.0 when used with Rails >=
 7.1.0. A possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
 Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if HTML5
 sanitization is enabled and the application developer has overridden the
 sanitizer's allowed tags where the "math", "mtext", "table", and "style"
 elements are allowed and either either "mglyph" or "malignmark" are
 allowed. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.1.
