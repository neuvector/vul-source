Description:
 astral-tokio-tar is a tar archive reading/writing library for async Rust.
 In versions 0.5.3 and earlier of astral-tokio-tar, tar archives may extract
 outside of their intended destination directory when using the
 Entry::unpack_in_raw API. Additionally, the Entry::allow_external_symlinks
 control (which defaults to true) could be bypassed via a pair of symlinks
 that individually point within the destination but combine to point outside
 of it. These behaviors could be used individually or combined to bypass the
 intended security control of limiting extraction to the given directory.
 This in turn would allow an attacker with a malicious tar archive to
 perform an arbitrary file write and potentially pivot into code execution.
 This issue has been patched in version 0.5.4. There is no workaround other
 than upgrading.
