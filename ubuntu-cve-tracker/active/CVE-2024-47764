Description:
 cookie is a basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers. The
 cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in
 an unexpected cookie value. A similar escape can be used for path and
 domain, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie. Upgrade
 to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for name, path, and domain.
