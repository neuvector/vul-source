Description:
 An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.7.0. A safe-error attack via
 Rowhammer, namely FAULT+PROBE, leads to ECDSA key disclosure. When
 WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS is used in signing operations with private ECC
 keys,
 
 such as in server-side TLS connections, the connection is halted if any
 fault occurs. The success rate in a certain amount of connection requests
 can be processed via an advanced technique for ECDSA key recovery.
