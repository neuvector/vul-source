Description:
 Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for
 multi-language development. In some cases, when Gradle parses XML files,
 resolving XML external entities is not disabled. Combined with an Out Of
 Band XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to exfiltration of
 local text files to a remote server. Gradle parses XML files for several
 purposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files it generated or were
 already present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors and Maven POM files can
 be fetched from remote repositories and parsed by Gradle. In Gradle 7.6.3
 and 8.4, resolving XML external entities has been disabled for all use
 cases to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will now refuse to
 parse XML files that have XML external entities.
