Description:
 A vulnerability was found in GNOME libgsf up to 1.14.53. It has been rated
 as critical. This issue affects the function gsf_property_settings_collec.

 buffer overflow. Attacking locally is a requirement. The vendor was
 contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.
