Description:
 OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
 share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network.
 Affected versions of the desktop application were found to be vulnerable to
 denial of service via an undisclosed vulnerability in the QT image parsing.
 Roughly 20 bytes lead to 2GB memory consumption and this can be triggered
 multiple times. To be abused, this vulnerability requires rendering in the
 history tab, so some user interaction is required. An adversary with
 knowledge of the Onion service address in public mode or with
 authentication in private mode can perform a Denial of Service attack,
 which quickly results in out-of-memory for the server. This requires the
 desktop application with rendered history, therefore the impact is only
 elevated. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.
