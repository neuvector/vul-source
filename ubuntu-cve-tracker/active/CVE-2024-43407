Description:
 CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A
 potential vulnerability has been discovered in CKEditor 4 Code Snippet
 GeSHi plugin. The vulnerability allowed a reflected XSS attack by
 exploiting a flaw in the GeSHi syntax highlighter library hosted by the
 victim. The GeSHi library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4
 source files. In a specific scenario, an attacker could craft a malicious
 script that could be executed by sending a request to the GeSHi library
 hosted on a PHP web server. The GeSHi library is no longer actively
 maintained. Due to the lack of ongoing support and updates, potential
 security vulnerabilities have been identified with its continued use. To
 mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security of the CKEditor 4, we
 have decided to completely remove the GeSHi library as a dependency. This
 change aims to maintain a secure environment and reduce the risk of any
 security incidents related to outdated or unsupported software. The fix is
 be available in version 4.25.0-lts.
