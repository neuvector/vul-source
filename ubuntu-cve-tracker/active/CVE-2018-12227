Description:
 An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.21.1, 14.x
 before 14.7.7, and 15.x before 15.4.1 and Certified Asterisk 13.18-cert
 before 13.18-cert4 and 13.21-cert before 13.21-cert2. When endpoint
 specific ACL rules block a SIP request, they respond with a 403 forbidden.
 However, if an endpoint is not identified, then a 401 unauthorized response
 is sent. This vulnerability just discloses which requests hit a defined
 endpoint. The ACL rules cannot be bypassed to gain access to the disclosed
 endpoints.
