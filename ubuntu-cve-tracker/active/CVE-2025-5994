Description:
 A multi-vendor cache poisoning vulnerability named 'Rebirthday Attack' has
 been discovered in caching resolvers that support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS).
 Unbound is also vulnerable when compiled with ECS support, i.e.,
 '--enable-subnet', AND configured to send ECS information along with
 queries to upstream name servers, i.e., at least one of the
 'send-client-subnet', 'client-subnet-zone' or
 'client-subnet-always-forward' options is used. Resolvers supporting ECS
 need to segregate outgoing queries to accommodate for different outgoing
 ECS information. This re-opens up resolvers to a birthday paradox attack
 (Rebirthday Attack) that tries to match the DNS transaction ID in order to
 cache non-ECS poisonous replies.
