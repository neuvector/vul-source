Description:
 A flaw was found in Avahi-daemon, which relies on fixed source ports for
 wide-area DNS queries. This issue simplifies attacks where malicious DNS
 responses are injected.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Avahi upstream hasn't fixed this issue, but they now disable
 mdeslaur> wide-area by default: https://github.com/avahi/avahi/pull/577
 mdeslaur> Another bug exists to track improving wide-area:
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/avahi/avahi/issues/578
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Since there is no proper fix for this issue from upstream, this
 mdeslaur> CVE is being deferred for now.
Mitigation:
 This issue can be mitigated by disabling wide-area DNS queries. This can
 be done by setting enable-wide-are=no in /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf
