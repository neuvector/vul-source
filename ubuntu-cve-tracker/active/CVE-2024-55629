Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to 7.0.8, TCP streams
 with TCP urgent data (out of band data) can lead to Suricata analyzing data
 differently than the applications at the TCP endpoints, leading to possible
 evasions. Suricata 7.0.8 includes options to allow users to configure how
 to handle TCP urgent data. In IPS mode, you can use a rule such as drop tcp
 any any -> any any (sid:1; tcp.flags:U*;) to drop all the packets with
 urgent flag set.
