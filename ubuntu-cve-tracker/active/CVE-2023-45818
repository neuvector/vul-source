Description:
 TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting
 (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s core undo and redo
 functionality. When a carefully-crafted HTML snippet passes the XSS
 sanitisation layer, it is manipulated as a string by internal trimming
 functions before being stored in the undo stack. If the HTML snippet is
 restored from the undo stack, the combination of the string manipulation
 and reparative parsing by either the browser's native [DOMParser
 API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) (TinyMCE
 6) or the SaxParser API (TinyMCE 5) mutates the HTML maliciously, allowing
 an XSS payload to be executed. This vulnerability has been patched in
 TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring HTML is trimmed using
 node-level manipulation instead of string manipulation. Users are advised
 to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
