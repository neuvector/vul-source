Description:
 ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system. A
 bug exists in the cloud ClickHouse offering prior to version 24.0.2.54535
 and in github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse version 23.1. Query caching
 bypasses the role based access controls and the policies being enforced on
 roles. In affected versions, the query cache only respects separate users,
 however this is not documented and not expected behavior. People relying on
 ClickHouse roles can have their access control lists bypassed if they are
 using query caching. Attackers who have control of a role could guess
 queries and see data they shouldn't have access to. Version 24.1 of
 ClickHouse and version 24.0.2.54535 of ClickHouse Cloud contain a patch for
 this issue. Based on the documentation, role based access control should be
 enforced regardless if query caching is enabled or not.
