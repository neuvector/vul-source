Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest
 OS users to achieve unintended read/write DMA access, and possibly cause a
 denial of service (host OS crash) or gain privileges. This occurs because a
 backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU updates were not always correct.
 NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-15565.
