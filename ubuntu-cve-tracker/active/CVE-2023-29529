Description:
 matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and
 TypeScript. An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call is
 taking place can eavesdrop on the video and audio of participants using
 matrix-js-sdk, without their knowledge. To affected matrix-js-sdk users,
 the attacker will not appear to be participating in the call. This attack
 is possible because matrix-js-sdk's group call implementation accepts
 incoming direct calls from other users, even if they have not yet declared
 intent to participate in the group call, as a means of resolving a race
 condition in call setup. Affected versions do not restrict access to the
 user's outbound media in this case. Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. This
 is fixed in matrix-js-sdk 24.1.0. As a workaround, users may hold group
 calls in private rooms where only the exact users who are expected to
 participate in the call are present.
