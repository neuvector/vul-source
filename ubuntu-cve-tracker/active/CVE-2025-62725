Description:
 Docker Compose trusts the path information embedded in remote OCI compose
 artifacts. When a layer includes the annotations com.docker.compose.extends
 or com.docker.compose.envfile, Compose joins the attacker‑supplied value
 from com.docker.compose.file/com.docker.compose.envfile with its local
 cache directory and writes the file there. This affects any platform or
 workflow that resolves remote OCI compose artifacts, Docker Desktop,
 standalone Compose binaries on Linux, CI/CD runners, cloud dev environments
 is affected. An attacker can escape the cache directory and overwrite
 arbitrary files on the machine running docker compose, even if the user
 only runs read‑only commands such as docker compose config or docker
 compose ps. This issue is fixed in v2.40.2.
