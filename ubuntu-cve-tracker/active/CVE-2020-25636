Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible Base when using the aws_ssm connection plugin
 as there is no namespace separation for file transfers. Files are written
 directly to the root bucket, making possible to have collisions when
 running multiple ansible processes. This issue affects mainly the service
 availability.
