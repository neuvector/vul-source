Description:
 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g.
 users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions
 prior to 8.0 the session files include the LDAP user name and password in
 clear text if the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed or encryption is
 disabled by configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users
 unable to upgrade should install the PHP OpenSSL extension and make sure
 session encryption is enabled in LAM main configuration.
