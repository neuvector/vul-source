Description:
 stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis
 files. A crafted file may trigger out of buffer write in `start_decoder`
 because at maximum `m->submaps` can be 16 but `submap_floor` and
 `submap_residue` are declared as arrays of 15 elements. This issue may lead
 to code execution.
