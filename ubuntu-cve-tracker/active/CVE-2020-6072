Description:
 An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the label-parsing
 functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed
 labels in mDNS messages, the rr_decode function's return value is not
 checked, leading to a double free that could be exploited to execute
 arbitrary code. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this
 vulnerability.
