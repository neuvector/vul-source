Description:
 Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network
 resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for
 reporting. The TLS certificate validation in all Icinga 2 versions starting
 from 2.4.0 was flawed, allowing an attacker to impersonate both trusted
 cluster nodes as well as any API users that use TLS client certificates for
 authentication (ApiUser objects with the client_cn attribute set). This
 vulnerability has been fixed in v2.14.3, v2.13.10, v2.12.11, and v2.11.12.
