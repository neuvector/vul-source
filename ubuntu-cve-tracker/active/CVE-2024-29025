Description:
 Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for
 rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers &
 clients. The `HttpPostRequestDecoder` can be tricked to accumulate data.
 While the decoder can store items on the disk if configured so, there are
 no limits to the number of fields the form can have, an attacher can send a
 chunked post consisting of many small fields that will be accumulated in
 the `bodyListHttpData` list. The decoder cumulates bytes in the
 `undecodedChunk` buffer until it can decode a field, this field can
 cumulate data without limits. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.108.Final.
