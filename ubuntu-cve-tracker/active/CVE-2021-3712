Description:
 ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING
 structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field
 holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are
 repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL
 (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed
 using OpenSSL's own "d2i" functions (and other similar parsing functions)
 as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set()
 function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING
 structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct
 valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by
 directly setting the "data" and "length" fields in the ASN1_STRING array.
 This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
 OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the
 ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not
 guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an
 application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1
 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the
 application without NUL terminating the "data" field, then a read buffer
 overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints
 processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly
 constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL
 parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated
 ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(),
 X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor
 can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then
 process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue
 could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service
 attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents
 (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l
 (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).
