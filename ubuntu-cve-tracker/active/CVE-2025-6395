Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the GnuTLS software in
 _gnutls_figure_common_ciphersuite(). When it reads certain settings from a
 template file, it can allow an attacker to cause an out-of-bounds (OOB)
 NULL pointer write, resulting in memory corruption and a denial of service
 (DoS) that could crash the system.
