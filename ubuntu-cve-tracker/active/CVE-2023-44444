Description:
 GIMP PSP File Parsing Off-By-One Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This
 vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
 installations of GIMP. User interaction is required to exploit this
 vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
 malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PSP files.
 Crafted data in a PSP file can trigger an off-by-one error when calculating
 a location to write within a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage
 this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
 Was ZDI-CAN-22097.
