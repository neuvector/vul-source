Description:
 BusyBox wget thru 1.3.7 accepted raw CR (0x0D)/LF (0x0A) and other C0
 control bytes in the HTTP request-target (path/query), allowing the request
 line to be split and attacker-controlled headers to be injected. To
 preserve the HTTP/1.1 request-line shape METHOD SP request-target SP
 HTTP/1.1, a raw space (0x20) in the request-target must also be rejected
 (clients should use %20).
