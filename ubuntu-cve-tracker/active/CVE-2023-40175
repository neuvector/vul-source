Description:
 Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. Prior to versions
 6.3.1 and 5.6.7, puma exhibited incorrect behavior when parsing chunked
 transfer encoding bodies and zero-length Content-Length headers in a way
 that allowed HTTP request smuggling. Severity of this issue is highly
 dependent on the nature of the web site using puma is. This could be caused
 by either incorrect parsing of trailing fields in chunked transfer encoding
 bodies or by parsing of blank/zero-length Content-Length headers. Both
 issues have been addressed and this vulnerability has been fixed in
 versions 6.3.1 and 5.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
