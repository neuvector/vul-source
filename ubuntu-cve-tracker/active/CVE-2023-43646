Description:
 get-func-name is a module to retrieve a function's name securely and
 consistently both in NodeJS and the browser. Versions prior to 2.0.1 are
 subject to a regular expression denial of service (redos) vulnerability
 which may lead to a denial of service when parsing malicious input. This
 vulnerability can be exploited when there is an imbalance in parentheses,
 which results in excessive backtracking and subsequently increases the CPU
 load and processing time significantly. This vulnerability can be triggered
 using the following input: '\t'.repeat(54773) + '\t/function/i'. This issue
 has been addressed in commit `f934b228b` which has been included in
 releases from 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
