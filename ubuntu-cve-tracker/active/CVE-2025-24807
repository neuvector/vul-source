Description:
 eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution
 Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). Prior to versions
 2.6.10, 2.10.7, 2.14.5, 3.0.2, 3.1.2, and 3.2.0, per design, PermissionsCA
 is not full chain validated, nor is the expiration date validated. Access
 control plugin validates only the S/MIME signature which causes an expired
 PermissionsCA to be taken as valid. Even though this issue is responsible
 for allowing `governance/permissions` from an expired PermissionsCA and
 having the system crash when PermissionsCA is not self-signed and contains
 the full-chain, the impact is low. Versions 2.6.10, 2.10.7, 2.14.5, 3.0.2,
 3.1.2, and 3.2.0 contain a fix for the issue.
