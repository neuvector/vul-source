Description:
 NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or
 application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with
 libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected.
 It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable
 code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the
 iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code
 shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would
 usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an
 XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for
 example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If
 untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk
 function, a crash can be triggered.
