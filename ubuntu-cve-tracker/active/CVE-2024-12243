Description:
 A flaw was found in GnuTLS, which relies on libtasn1 for ASN.1 data
 processing. Due to an inefficient algorithm in libtasn1, decoding certain
 DER-encoded certificate data can take excessive time, leading to increased
 resource consumption. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send a
 specially crafted certificate, causing GnuTLS to become unresponsive or
 slow, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
