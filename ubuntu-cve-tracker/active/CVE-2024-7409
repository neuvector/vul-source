Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> The changes required to fix this issue in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and
 mdeslaur> earlier are intrusive and uncovered a regression during QA.
 mdeslaur> For Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, the fix for this
 mdeslaur> issue introduces a backwards-incompatible change and may
 mdeslaur> require changes to libvirt to support passing the
 mdeslaur> max-connections parameter.
