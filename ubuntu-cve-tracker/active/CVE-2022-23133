Description:
 An authenticated user can create a hosts group from the configuration with
 XSS payload, which will be available for other users. When XSS is stored by
 an authenticated malicious actor and other users try to search for groups
 during new host creation, the XSS payload will fire and the actor can steal
 session cookies and perform session hijacking to impersonate users or take
 over their accounts.
