Description:
 ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software
 application for Linux which supports IP, USB and Analog cameras. Versions
 prior to 1.36.33 and 1.37.33 contain a Local File Inclusion (Untrusted
 Search Path) vulnerability via /web/index.php. By controlling $view, any
 local file ending in .php can be executed. This is supposed to be mitigated
 by calling detaintPath, however dentaintPath does not properly sandbox the
 path. This can be exploited by constructing paths like "..././", which get
 replaced by "../". This issue is patched in versions 1.36.33 and 1.37.33.
