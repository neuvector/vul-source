Description:
 Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved Memory
 Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") for
 Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These are typically used
 for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.
 
 Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a device
 associated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regions
 need to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logic
 establishing these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting in
 such mappings to potentially remain in place when they should have been
 removed again.  Respective guests would then gain access to memory
 regions which they aren't supposed to have access to.
