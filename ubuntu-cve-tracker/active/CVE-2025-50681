Description:
 igmpproxy 0.4 before commit 2b30c36 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application crash) via a crafted IGMPv3 membership
 report packet with a malicious source address. Due to insufficient
 validation in the `recv_igmp()` function in src/igmpproxy.c, an invalid
 group record type can trigger a NULL pointer dereference when logging the
 address using `inet_fmtsrc()`. This vulnerability can be exploited by
 sending malformed multicast traffic to a host running igmpproxy, leading to
 a crash. igmpproxy is used in various embedded networking environments and
 consumer-grade IoT devices (such as home routers and media gateways) to
 handle multicast traffic for IPTV and other streaming services. Affected
 devices that rely on unpatched versions of igmpproxy may be vulnerable to
 remote denial-of-service attacks across a LAN .
