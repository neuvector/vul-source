Description:
 python-multipart is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When parsing
 form data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \r or LF \n) in front of
 the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This
 happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause
 excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this by
 sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the
 last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for
 a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall
 the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting
 in a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18.
