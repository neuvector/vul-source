Description:
 Sinatra is a domain-specific language for creating web applications in
 Ruby. In versions prior to 4.2.0, there is a denial of service
 vulnerability in the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` header parsing
 component of Sinatra, if the `etag` method is used when constructing the
 response. Carefully crafted input can cause `If-Match` and `If-None-Match`
 header parsing in Sinatra to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly
 resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is typically
 involved in generating the `ETag` header value. Any applications that use
 the `etag` method when generating a response are impacted. Version 4.2.0
 fixes the issue.
