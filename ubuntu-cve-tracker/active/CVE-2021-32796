Description:
 xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level
 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older
 do not correctly escape special characters when serializing elements
 removed from their ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes
 during XML processing in some downstream applications. This issue has been
 resolved in version 0.7.0. As a workaround downstream applications can
 validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.
