Description:
 The Jupyter Server provides the backend for Jupyter web applications.
 Jupyter Server on Windows has a vulnerability that lets unauthenticated
 attackers leak the NTLMv2 password hash of the Windows user running the
 Jupyter server. An attacker can crack this password to gain access to the
 Windows machine hosting the Jupyter server, or access other
 network-accessible machines or 3rd party services using that credential. Or
 an attacker perform an NTLM relay attack without cracking the credential to
 gain access to other network-accessible machines. This vulnerability is
 fixed in 2.14.1.
