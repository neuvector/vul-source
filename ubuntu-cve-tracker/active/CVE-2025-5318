Description:
 A flaw was found in the libssh library. An out-of-bounds read can be
 triggered in the sftp_handle function due to an incorrect comparison check
 that permits the function to access memory beyond the valid handle list and
 to return an invalid pointer, which is used in further processing. This
 vulnerability allows an authenticated remote attacker to potentially read
 unintended memory regions, exposing sensitive information or affect service
 behavior.
