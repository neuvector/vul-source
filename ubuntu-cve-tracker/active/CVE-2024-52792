Description:
 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a php webfrontend for managing entries (e.g.
 users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In affected
 versions LAM does not properly sanitize configuration values, that are set
 via `mainmanage.php` and `confmain.php`. This allows setting arbitrary
 config values and thus effectively bypassing `mitigation` of
 CVE-2024-23333/GHSA-fm9w-7m7v-wxqv. Configuration values for the main
 config or server profiles are set via `mainmanage.php` and `confmain.php`.
 The values are written to `config.cfg` or `serverprofile.conf` in the
 format of `settingsName: settingsValue` line-by-line.
 An attacker can smuggle arbitrary config values in a config file, by
 inserting a newline into certain config fields, followed by the value. This
 vulnerability has been addressed in version 9.0. All users are advised to
 upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
