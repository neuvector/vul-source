Description:
 Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File
 Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended
 node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in
 the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to modify and/or
 gain access to arbitrary files on a user's system when the package is
 installed. This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This
 vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.
