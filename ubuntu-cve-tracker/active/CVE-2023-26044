Description:
 react/http is an event-driven, streaming HTTP client and server
 implementation for ReactPHP.  Previous versions of ReactPHP's HTTP server
 component contain a potential DoS vulnerability that can cause high CPU
 load when processing large HTTP request bodies. This vulnerability has
 little to no impact on the default configuration, but can be exploited when
 explicitly using the RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with very large settings.
 This might lead to consuming large amounts of CPU time for processing
 requests and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate
 user requests. This issue has been addressed in release 1.9.0. Users are
 advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may keep the request body
 limited using RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with a sensible value which
 should mitigate the issue. An infrastructure or DevOps workaround could be
 to place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out
 any excessive HTTP request bodies.
