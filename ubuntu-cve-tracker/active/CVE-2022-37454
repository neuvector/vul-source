Description:
 The Keccak XKCP SHA-3 reference implementation before fdc6fef has an
 integer overflow and resultant buffer overflow that allows attackers to
 execute arbitrary code or eliminate expected cryptographic properties. This
 occurs in the sponge function interface.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> PEAR issues should go against php-pear as of xenial
 rodrigo-zaiden> PHP includes Keccak code for sha3 starting from php7.2
 leosilva> in PHP it was introduced in 91663a92d1697fc30a7ba4687d73e0f63ec2baa1 php-7.2.0alpha1
 mdeslaur> Python 3.11 switched to using tiny_sha3, so not affected.
