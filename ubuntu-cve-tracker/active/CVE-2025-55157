Description:
 Vim is an open source, command line text editor. In versions from 9.1.1231
 to before 9.1.1400, When processing nested tuples in Vim script, an error
 during evaluation can trigger a use-after-free in Vimâ€™s internal tuple
 reference management. Specifically, the tuple_unref() function may access
 already freed memory due to improper lifetime handling, leading to memory
 corruption. The exploit requires direct user interaction, as the script
 must be explicitly executed within Vim. This issue has been patched in
 version 9.1.1400.
