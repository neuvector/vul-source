Description:
 XBMC version 11, including builds up to the 2012-11-04 nightly release,
 contains a path traversal vulnerability in its embedded HTTP server. When
 accessed via HTTP Basic Authentication, the server fails to properly
 sanitize URI input, allowing authenticated users to request files outside
 the intended document root. An attacker can exploit this flaw to read
 arbitrary files from the host filesystem, including sensitive configuration
 or credential files.
