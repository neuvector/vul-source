Description:
 Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS
 keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG
 keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver
 network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of
 service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> this is a weakness in the PGP keyserver design.
 alexmurray| gnupg upstream has 2 mitigations for this - firstly, don't
  import key signatures by default anymore, and to fallback to only
  import self-signatures on very large keyblocks
 mdeslaur> as of 2020-01-06, there is no ideal fix for this issue
 mdeslaur> marking this CVE as deferred until a complete fix is available
 sbeattie> gnupg mitigations landed in upstream in 2.2.17 with important
  fixes in 2.2.18
 sbeattie> 2.2.19-3ubuntu1 introduced a debian/ubuntu specific change to
  use keys.openpgp.org as the default keyserver
 sbeattie> any backports to address this issue will be complex and
  introduce changes in behavior
 sbeattie> sks in debian introduced very basic filtering in
  1.1.6+git20210302.c3ba6d5a-1
 rodrigo-zaiden> as of 2022-03-22, there is no upstream backport for
  gnupg 1.4 series. Backporting from 2.2 is too risky.
