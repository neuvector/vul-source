Description:
 The Apache Qpid Proton-J transport includes an optional wrapper layer to
 perform TLS, enabled by use of the 'transport.ssl(...)' methods. Unless a
 verification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modes
 previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate,
 with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate
 verification mode with or without hostname verification being performed.
 The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid
 Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in an
 exception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted,
 leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Uses
 of the Proton-J protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transport
 TLS wrapper are not impacted, e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-J
 utilising the optional transport TLS wrapper layer that wish to enable
 hostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later and
 utilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now the
 default for client mode usage unless configured otherwise.
