Description:
 Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in
 how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an
 attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary
 Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the
 content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of
 application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications
 which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to
 str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's
 possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then
 pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja,
 but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the
 fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This
 vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.
