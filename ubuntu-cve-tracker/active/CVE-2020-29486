Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Nodes in xenstore have an
 ownership. In oxenstored, a owner could give a node away. However, node
 ownership has quota implications. Any guest can run another guest out of
 quota, or create an unbounded number of nodes owned by dom0, thus running
 xenstored out of memory A malicious guest administrator can cause a denial
 of service against a specific guest or against the whole host. All systems
 using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the
 default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is
 available. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable.
