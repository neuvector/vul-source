Description:
 Adminer and AdminerEvo are vulnerable to SSRF via database connection
 fields. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to enumerate or
 access systems the attacker would not otherwise have access to.Â Adminer is
 no longer supported, but this issue was fixed in AdminerEvo version 4.8.4.
