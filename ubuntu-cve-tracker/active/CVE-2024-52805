Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. In Synapse before 1.120.1,
 multipart/form-data requests can in certain configurations transiently
 increase memory consumption beyond expected levels while processing the
 request, which can be used to amplify denial of service attacks. Synapse
 1.120.1 resolves the issue by denying requests with unsupported
 multipart/form-data content type.
