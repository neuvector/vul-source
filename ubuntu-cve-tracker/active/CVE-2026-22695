Description:
 LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create,
 and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From
 1.6.51 to 1.6.53, there is a heap buffer over-read in the libpng simplified
 API function png_image_finish_read when processing interlaced 16-bit PNGs
 with 8-bit output format and non-minimal row stride. This is a regression
 introduced by the fix for CVE-2025-65018. This vulnerability is fixed in
 1.6.54.
