 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7635-1
Description:
 A heap-buffer-overread vulnerability was found in GnuTLS in how it handles
 the Certificate Transparency (CT) Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)
 extension during X.509 certificate parsing. This flaw allows a malicious
 user to create a certificate containing a malformed SCT extension (OID
 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.2) that contains sensitive data. This issue leads to
 the exposure of confidential information when GnuTLS verifies certificates
 from certain websites when the certificate (SCT) is not checked correctly.
