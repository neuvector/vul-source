Description:
 Fulcio is a free-to-use certificate authority for issuing code signing
 certificates for an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity. Prior to 1.8.3,
 function identity.extractIssuerURL splits (via a call to strings.Split) its
 argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of
 a malicious request with an (invalid) OIDC identity token in the payload
 containing many period characters, a call to extractIssuerURL incurs
 allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the
 function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This
 vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.3.
