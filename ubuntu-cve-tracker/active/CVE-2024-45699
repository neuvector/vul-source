 https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-26254
Description:
 The endpoint /zabbix.php?action=export.valuemaps suffers from a Cross-Site
 Scripting vulnerability via the backurl parameter. This is caused by the
 reflection of user-supplied data without appropriate HTML escaping or
 output encoding. As a result, a JavaScript payload may be injected into the
 above endpoint causing it to be executed within the context of the victim's
 browser.
