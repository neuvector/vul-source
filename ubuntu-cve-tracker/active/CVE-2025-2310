Description:
 A vulnerability was found in HDF5 1.14.6 and classified as critical. This
 issue affects the function H5MM_strndup of the component Metadata Attribute
 Decoder. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. Attacking
 locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and
 may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at
 the moment. The vendor was contacted early about a batch of
 vulnerabilities. His response was "reject" without further explanation. We
 have not received an elaboration even after asking politely for further
 details. Currently we assume that the vendor wants to "dispute" the entries
 which is why they are flagged as such until further details become
 available.
