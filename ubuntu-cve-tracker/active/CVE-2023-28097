Description:
 OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
 Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, a malformed SIP message containing a
 large _Content-Length_ value and a specially crafted Request-URI causes a
 segmentation fault in OpenSIPS. This issue occurs when a large amount of
 shared memory using the `-m` flag was allocated to OpenSIPS, such as 10 GB
 of RAM. On the test system, this issue occurred when shared memory was set
 to `2362` or higher. This issue is fixed in versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6. The
 only workaround is to guarantee that the Content-Length value of input
 messages is never larger than `2147483647`.
