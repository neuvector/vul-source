Description:
 libavcodec/pthread_frame.c in FFmpeg before 5.1.2, as used in VLC and other
 products, leaves stale hwaccel state in worker threads, which allows
 attackers to trigger a use-after-free and execute arbitrary code in some
 circumstances (e.g., hardware re-initialization upon a mid-video SPS change
 when Direct3D11 is used).

Notes:
 ccdm94> As of 2023-04-26 there is no public reproducer available for this issue,
 ccdm94> so there is no way to confirm through vulnerability testing that Xenial
 ccdm94> and Bionic are vulnerable to this issue.
 ccdm94> 
 ccdm94> Xenial's version of FFmpeg is 2.8. Upstream has only provided patches
 ccdm94> for versions 4.4.x, 5.0.x and 5.1.x. Considering that the code for
 ccdm94> pthread_frame.c (file altered by the patch) and for FFmpeg has changed
 ccdm94> significantly from version 2.8 to version 4.4.3, applying the 4.4.3
 ccdm94> patch is very likely to introduce security issues and regressions.
 ccdm94> Because of the very intrusive nature of the backport, Xenial and Bionic
 ccdm94> (at version 3.4) will not be patched for this issue, and will therefore
 ccdm94> be marked as ignored.
