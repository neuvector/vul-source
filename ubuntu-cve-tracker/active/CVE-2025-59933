Description:
 libvips is a demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing library.
 For versions 8.17.1 and below, when libvips is compiled with support for
 PDF input via poppler, the pdfload operation is affected by a buffer read
 overflow when parsing the header of a crafted PDF with a page that defines
 a width but not a height. Those using libvips compiled without support for
 PDF input are unaffected as well as thosewith support for PDF input via
 PDFium. This issue is fixed in version 8.17.2. A workaround for those
 affected is to block the VipsForeignLoadPdf operation via
 vips_operation_block_set, which is available in most language bindings, or
 to set VIPS_BLOCK_UNTRUSTED environment variable at runtime, which will
 block all untrusted loaders including PDF input via poppler.
