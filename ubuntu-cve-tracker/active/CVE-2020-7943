Description:
 Puppet Server and PuppetDB provide useful performance and debugging
 information via their metrics API endpoints. For PuppetDB this may contain
 things like hostnames. Puppet Server reports resource names and titles for
 defined types (which may contain sensitive information) as well as function
 names and class names. Previously, these endpoints were open to the local
 network. PE 2018.1.13 & 2019.5.0, Puppet Server 6.9.2 & 5.3.12, and
 PuppetDB 6.9.1 & 5.2.13 disable trapperkeeper-metrics /v1 metrics API and
 only allows /v2 access on localhost by default. This affects software
