Description:
 Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
 reusable PHP components. When authenticating users Symfony by default
 regenerates the session ID upon login, but preserves the rest of session
 attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might
 enables same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by
 performing an attack similar to a session-fixation. This issue has been
 fixed in the 4.4 branch.
