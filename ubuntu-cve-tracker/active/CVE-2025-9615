Notes:
 mdeslaur> fixing this issue in network-manager requires updating all the
 mdeslaur> network-manager VPN plugins to use the same new method. This is
 mdeslaur> likely too intrusive to do in stable releases.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Marking as deferred until all the VPN plugins and an update
 mdeslaur> strategy has been determined.
 mdeslaur> Possibly incomplete list of VPN plugins:
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-fortisslvpn
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-iodine
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-l2tp
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-openconnect
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-openvpn
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-pptp
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-sstp
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-strongswan
 mdeslaur> - network-manager-vpnc
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Fixing this CVE likely also fixes CVE-2012-1096
