Description:
 HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions prior
 to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited
 to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is
 uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based applications are served
 on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is
 commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update
 to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request
 handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst =
 $conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request`
 object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl =
 $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that should
 be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length'
 SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer, or, a comma
 separated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`).
 Anything else MUST be rejected.
