Description:
 A flaw was found in Podman. In a Containerfile or Podman, data written to
 RUN --mount=type=bind mounts during the podman build is not discarded. This
 issue can lead to files created within the container appearing in the
 temporary build context directory on the host, leaving the created files
 accessible.
