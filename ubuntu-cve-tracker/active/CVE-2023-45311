Description:
 fsevents before 1.2.11 depends on the
 https://fsevents-binaries.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com URL, which might allow
 an adversary to execute arbitrary code if any JavaScript project (that
 depends on fsevents) distributes code that was obtained from that URL at a
 time when it was controlled by an adversary. NOTE: some sources feel that
 this means that no version is affected any longer, because the URL is not
 controlled by an adversary.

Notes:
 ccdm94> qtwebengine-opensource-src and npm contain embedded copies of fsevents.
