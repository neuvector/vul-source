Description:
 Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. An
 admin user can create a device with a malicious hostname containing php
 code and repeat the installation process (completing only step 5 of the
 installation process is enough, no need to complete the steps before or
 after it) to use a php file as the cacti log file. After having the
 malicious hostname end up in the logs (log poisoning), one can simply go to
 the log file url to execute commands to achieve RCE. This issue has been
 addressed in version 1.2.28 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are
 no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
