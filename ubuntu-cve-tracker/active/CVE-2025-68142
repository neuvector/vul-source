Description:
 PyMdown Extensions is a set of extensions for the `Python-Markdown`
 markdown project. Versions prior to 10.16.1 have a ReDOS bug found within
 the figure caption extension (`pymdownx.blocks.caption`). In systems that
 take unchecked user content, this could cause long hanges when processing
 the data if a malicious payload was crafted. This issue is patched in
 Release 10.16.1. As a workaround, those who process unknown user content
 without timeouts or other safeguards in place to prevent really large,
 malicious content being aimed at systems may avoid the use of
 `pymdownx.blocks.caption` until they're able to upgrade.
