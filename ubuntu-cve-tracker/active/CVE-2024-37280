Description:
 A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when
 an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of “passthrough” type.
 Under certain circumstances, ingesting documents in this index would cause
 a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately lead to a Denial of
 Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.
