Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in the libarchive library. This flaw
 involves an 'off-by-one' miscalculation when handling prefixes and suffixes
 for file names. This can lead to a 1-byte write overflow. While seemingly
 small, such an overflow can corrupt adjacent memory, leading to
 unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or in specific circumstances,
 could be leveraged as a building block for more sophisticated exploitation.
