Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
 Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix Federation API allows remote homeservers
 to request the authorization events in a room. This is necessary so that a
 homeserver receiving some events can validate that those events are
 legitimate and permitted in their room. However, in versions of Synapse up
 to and including 1.68.0, a Synapse homeserver answering a query for
 authorization events does not sufficiently check that the requesting server
 should be able to access them. The issue was patched in Synapse 1.69.0.
 Homeserver administrators are advised to upgrade.
