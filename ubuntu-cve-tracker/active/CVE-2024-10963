Description:
 A flaw was found in pam_access, where certain rules in its configuration
 file are mistakenly treated as hostnames. This vulnerability allows
 attackers to trick the system by pretending to be a trusted hostname,
 gaining unauthorized access. This issue poses a risk for systems that rely
 on this feature to control who can access certain services or terminals.

 mdeslaur> The fix below simply introduces a new option called "nodns" that
 mdeslaur> reverts behaviour to pre 1.5.3 and will safely allow tty/service
 mdeslaur> names in access.conf
