Description:
 GIT version 2.15.1 and earlier contains a Input Validation Error
 vulnerability in Client that can result in problems including messing up
 terminal configuration to RCE. This attack appear to be exploitable via The
 user must interact with a malicious git server, (or have their traffic
 modified in a MITM attack).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This is really an issue with terminal emulators that allow
 mdeslaur> executing arbitrary code by displaying ANSI escape sequences.
 mdeslaur> Terminal emulators in Ubuntu do not allow executing arbitrary
 mdeslaur> code, so this issue is moot.
 mdeslaur> It is unlikely that git will ever fix this CVE to protect
 mdeslaur> against vulnerable terminal emulators.
 mdeslaur> As of 2025-02-17, this issue has never been fixed in git, and
 mdeslaur> is unlikely to ever be, marking as ignored in Ubuntu.
