Description:
 A flaw was found in how GLib’s GString manages memory when adding data to
 strings. If a string is already very large, combining it with more input
 can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system
 think it has enough memory when it doesn’t. As a result, data may be
 written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory
 corruption.
