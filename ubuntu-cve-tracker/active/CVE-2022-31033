Description:
 The Mechanize library is used for automating interaction with websites.
 Mechanize automatically stores and sends cookies, follows redirects, and
 can follow links and submit forms. In versions prior to 2.8.5 the
 Authorization header is leaked after a redirect to a different port on the
 same site. Users are advised to upgrade to Mechanize v2.8.5 or later. There
 are no known workarounds for this issue.
