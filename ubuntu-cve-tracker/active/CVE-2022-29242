Description:
 GOST engine is a reference implementation of the Russian GOST crypto
 algorithms for OpenSSL. TLS clients using GOST engine when ciphersuite
 `TLS_GOSTR341112_256_WITH_KUZNYECHIK_CTR_OMAC` is agreed and the server
 uses 512 bit GOST secret keys are vulnerable to buffer overflow. GOST
 engine version 3.0.1 contains a patch for this issue. Disabling ciphersuite
 `TLS_GOSTR341112_256_WITH_KUZNYECHIK_CTR_OMAC` is a possible workaround.
