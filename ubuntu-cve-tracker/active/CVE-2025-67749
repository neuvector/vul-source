Description:
 PCSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator. In versions
 2.5.377 and below, an unchecked offset and size used in a memcpy operation
 inside PCSX2's CDVD SCMD 0x91 and SCMD 0x8F handlers allow a specially
 crafted disc image or ELF to cause an out-of-bounds read from emulator
 memory. Because the offset and size is controlled through MG header fields,
 a specially crafted ELF can read data beyond the bounds of mg_buffer and
 have it reflected back into emulated memory. This issue is fixed in version
 2.5.378.
