Description:
  OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for data processing. A carefully
 crafted malicious OpenRefine project tar file can be used to trigger
 arbitrary code execution in the context of the OpenRefine process if a user
 can be convinced to import it. The vulnerability exists in all versions of
 OpenRefine up to and including 3.7.3. Users should update to OpenRefine
 3.7.4 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should only import
 OpenRefine projects from trusted sources.
