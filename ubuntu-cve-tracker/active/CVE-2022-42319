Description:
 Xenstore: Guests can cause Xenstore to not free temporary memory When
 working on a request of a guest, xenstored might need to allocate quite
 large amounts of memory temporarily. This memory is freed only after the
 request has been finished completely. A request is regarded to be finished
 only after the guest has read the response message of the request from the
 ring page. Thus a guest not reading the response can cause xenstored to not
 free the temporary memory. This can result in memory shortages causing
 Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored.
