Description:
 Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of
 presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. In affected versions
 template authors could inject php code by choosing a malicious file name
 for an extends-tag. Sites that cannot fully trust template authors should
 update asap. All users are advised to update. There is no patch for users
 on the v3 branch. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
