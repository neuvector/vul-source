Description:
 Python JSON Logger is a JSON Formatter for Python Logging. Between 30
 December 2024 and 4 March 2025 Python JSON Logger was vulnerable to RCE
 through a missing dependency. This occurred because msgspec-python313-pre
 was deleted by the owner leaving the name open to being claimed by a third
 party. If the package was claimed, it would allow them RCE on any Python
 JSON Logger user who installed the development dependencies on Python 3.13
 (e.g. pip install python-json-logger[dev]). This issue has been resolved
 with 3.3.0.
