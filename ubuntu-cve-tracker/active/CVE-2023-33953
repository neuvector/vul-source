Description:
 gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors
 could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in
 exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS
 attacks:
 
 - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser
 - Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser
 
 The unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred
 per-input-block in the parser, and because that could be unbounded due to
 the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop, with n selected
 by the client.
 
 The unbounded memory buffering bugs:
 
 - The header size limit check was behind the string reading code, so we
 needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as
 longer than 8 or 16kb.
 - HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0’s
 can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack parser needed to read
 all of them before concluding a parse.
 - gRPC’s metadata overflow check was performed per frame, so that the
 following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS:
 containing a: 1 CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3
 etc…
