Description:
 gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors
 could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in
 exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS
 attacks: - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser - Unbounded CPU
 consumption in the HPACK parser The unbounded CPU consumption is down to a
 copy that occurred per-input-block in the parser, and because that could be
 unbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop,
 with n selected by the client. The unbounded memory buffering bugs: - The
 header size limit check was behind the string reading code, so we needed to
 first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8
 or 16kb. - HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number
 of 0’s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack parser needed
 to read all of them before concluding a parse. - gRPC’s metadata overflow
 check was performed per frame, so that the following sequence of frames
 could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION:
 containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc…
