Description:
 Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. In
 versions prior to 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final, the
 `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestEncoder` has a CRLF injection with
 the request URI when constructing a request. This leads to request
 smuggling when `HttpRequestEncoder` is used without proper sanitization of
 the URI. Any application / framework using `HttpRequestEncoder` can be
 subject to be abused to perform request smuggling using CRLF injection.
 Versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final fix the issue.
