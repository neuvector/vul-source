Description:
 A flaw was found in dnsmasq before 2.83. A buffer overflow vulnerability
 was discovered in the way dnsmasq extract names from DNS packets before
 validating them with DNSSEC data. An attacker on the network, who can
 create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow with
 arbitrary data in a heap-allocated memory, possibly executing code on the
 machine. The flaw is in the rfc1035.c:extract_name() function, which writes
 data to the memory pointed by name assuming MAXDNAME*2 bytes are available
 in the buffer. However, in some code execution paths, it is possible
 extract_name() gets passed an offset from the base buffer, thus reducing,
 in practice, the number of available bytes that can be written in the
 buffer. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
 confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
