Description:
 phpMyAdmin 4.7.x and 4.8.x versions prior to 4.8.4 are affected by a series
 of CSRF flaws. By deceiving a user into clicking on a crafted URL, it is
 possible to perform harmful SQL operations such as renaming databases,
 creating new tables/routines, deleting designer pages, adding/deleting
 users, updating user passwords, killing SQL processes, etc.
