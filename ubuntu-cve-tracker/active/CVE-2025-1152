Description:
 A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in GNU Binutils
 2.43. Affected is the function xstrdup of the file xstrdup.c of the
 component ld. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is possible to
 launch the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The
 exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to
 the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this
 issue. The code maintainer explains: "I'm not going to commit some of the
 leak fixes I've been working on to the 2.44 branch due to concern that
 would destabilise ld. All of the reported leaks in this bugzilla have been
 fixed on binutils master."
