Description:
 Capstone is a disassembly framework. In versions 6.0.0-Alpha5 and prior,
 Skipdata length is not bounds-checked, so a user-provided skipdata callback
 can make cs_disasm/cs_disasm_iter memcpy more than 24 bytes into
 cs_insn.bytes, causing a heap buffer overflow in the disassembly path.
 Commit cbef767ab33b82166d263895f24084b75b316df3 fixes the issue.
