Description:
 The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement regular expression
 pattern matching. In version 10.45, a heap-buffer-overflow read
 vulnerability exists in the PCRE2 regular expression matching engine,
 specifically within the handling of the (*scs:...) (Scan SubString) verb
 when combined with (*ACCEPT) in src/pcre2_match.c. This vulnerability may
 potentially lead to information disclosure if the out-of-bounds data read
 during the memcmp affects the final match result in a way observable by the
 attacker. This issue has been resolved in version 10.46.
