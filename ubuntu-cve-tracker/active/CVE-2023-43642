Description:
 snappy-java is a Java port of the snappy, a fast C++
 compresser/decompresser developed by Google. The SnappyInputStream was
 found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when
 decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound
 check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. All versions
 of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3 are
 vulnerable to this issue. A fix has been introduced in commit `9f8c3cf74`
 which will be included in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to
 upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only accept compressed data from
 trusted sources.
