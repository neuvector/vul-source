Description:
 The UAMQP is a general purpose C library for AMQP 1.0. During a call to
 open_get_offered_capabilities, a memory allocation may fail causing a
 use-after-free issue and if a client called it during connection
 communication it may cause a remote code execution. Users are advised to
 update the submodule with commit `30865c9c`. There are no known workarounds
 for this vulnerability.
