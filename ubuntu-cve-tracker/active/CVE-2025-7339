Description:
 on-headers is a node.js middleware for listening to when a response writes
 headers. A bug in on-headers versions `<1.1.0` may result in response
 headers being inadvertently modified when an array is passed to
 `response.writeHead()`. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to receive a
 patch. Uses are strongly encouraged to upgrade to `1.1.0`, but this issue
 can be worked around by passing an object to `response.writeHead()` rather
 than an array.
