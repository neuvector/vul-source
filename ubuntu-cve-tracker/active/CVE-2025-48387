Description:
 tar-fs provides filesystem bindings for tar-stream. Versions prior to
 3.0.9, 2.1.3, and 1.16.5 have an issue where an extract can write outside
 the specified dir with a specific tarball. This has been patched in
 versions 3.0.9, 2.1.3, and 1.16.5. As a workaround, use the ignore option
 to ignore non files/directories.
