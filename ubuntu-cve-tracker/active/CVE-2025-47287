Description:
 Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When
 Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors, it logs
 a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This
 allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs,
 constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the
 logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0
 are affected. The vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to
 Tornado version 6.5.0 to receive a patch. As a workaround, risk can be
 mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in a proxy.
