Description:
 Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. Prior
 to 1.2.29, there is an input-validation flaw in the SNMP device
 configuration functionality. An authenticated Cacti user can supply crafted
 SNMP community strings containing control characters (including newlines)
 that are accepted, stored verbatim in the database, and later embedded into
 backend SNMP operations. In environments where downstream SNMP tooling or
 wrappers interpret newline-separated tokens as command boundaries, this can
 lead to unintended command execution with the privileges of the Cacti
 process. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.29.
