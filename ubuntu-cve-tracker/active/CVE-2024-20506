Description:
 A vulnerability in the ClamD service module of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)
 versions 1.4.0, 1.3.2 and prior versions, all 1.2.x versions, 1.0.6 and
 prior versions, all 0.105.x versions, all 0.104.x versions, and 0.103.11
 and all prior versions could allow an authenticated, local attacker to
 corrupt critical system files.
 
 The vulnerability is due to allowing the ClamD process to write to its log
 file while privileged without checking if the logfile has been replaced
 with a symbolic link. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they
 replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and
 then find a way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow the
 attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log messages
 after restart.
