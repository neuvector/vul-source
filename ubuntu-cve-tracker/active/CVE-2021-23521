Description:
 This affects the package juce-framework/JUCE before 6.1.5. This
 vulnerability is triggered when a malicious archive is crafted with an
 entry containing a symbolic link. When extracted, the symbolic link is
 followed outside of the target dir allowing writing arbitrary files on the
 target host. In some cases, this can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
 code. The vulnerable code is in the ZipFile::uncompressEntry function in
 juce_ZipFile.cpp and is executed when the archive is extracted upon calling
 uncompressTo() on a ZipFile object.
