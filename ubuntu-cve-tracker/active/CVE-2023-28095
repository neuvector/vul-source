Description:
 OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
 Versions prior to 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 have a potential issue in
 `msg_translator.c:2628` which might lead to a server crash. This issue was
 found while fuzzing the function `build_res_buf_from_sip_req` but could not
 be reproduced against a running instance of OpenSIPS. This issue could not
 be exploited against a running instance of OpenSIPS since no public
 function was found to make use of this vulnerable code. Even in the case of
 exploitation through unknown vectors, it is highly unlikely that this issue
 would lead to anything other than Denial of Service. This issue has been
 fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.
