Description:
 yaws before 2.0.4 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18
 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect CGI applications from
 the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment
 variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect a CGI
 application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a
 crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue.
