Description:
 In net/http in Go before 1.18.6 and 1.19.x before 1.19.1, attackers can
 cause a denial of service because an HTTP/2 connection can hang during
 closing if shutdown were preempted by a fatal error.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
 alexmurray| google-guest-agent contains a vendored copy of golang-golang-x-net
 mdeslaur> google-guest-agent doesn't start a http server except in tests
 mdeslaur> containerd does not listen on an HTTP/2 endpoint, so not
 mdeslaur> vulnerable.
