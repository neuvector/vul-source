Description:
 The Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before
 1.18.5 and 1.19.x before 1.19.3 has a NULL pointer dereference in
 kdc/do_tgs_req.c via a FAST inner body that lacks a server field.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> this vulnerability was introduced by commit 39548a5, as 
 ccdm94> established by upstream. Prior to this commit, an error
 ccdm94> would occur instead of the null deference. In the patch
 ccdm94> notes, the CVE is described as affecting releases 1.14
 ccdm94> and later only (meaning that xenial and trusty are not
 ccdm94> affected by this).
