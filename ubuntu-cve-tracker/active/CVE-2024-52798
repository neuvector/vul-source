Description:
 path-to-regexp turns path strings into a regular expressions. In certain
 cases, path-to-regexp will output a regular expression that can be
 exploited to cause poor performance. The regular expression that is
 vulnerable to backtracking can be generated in the 0.1.x release of
 path-to-regexp. Upgrade to 0.1.12. This vulnerability exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2024-45296.
