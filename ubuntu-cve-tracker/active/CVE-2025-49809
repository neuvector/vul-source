Description:
 mtr through 0.95, in certain privileged contexts, mishandles execution of a
 program specified by the MTR_PACKET environment variable. NOTE: mtr on
 macOS may often have Sudo rules, as an indirect consequence of Homebrew not
 installing setuid binaries.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This issue only affects deployments where an unprivileged user
 mdeslaur> can only run mtr though a specialized sudo configuration. While
 mdeslaur> this is a common scenario on macOS, it is unlikely to be a
 mdeslaur> common scenario on Ubuntu.
 mdeslaur> The patch allows creating a file called
 mdeslaur> /etc/mtr.is.run.under.sudo to disable the MTR_PACKET environment
 mdeslaur> variable from being used, so the patch alone will not fix
 mdeslaur> existing sudo configurations.
 mdeslaur> In addition, the default Ubuntu sudoers file already resets the
 mdeslaur> environment with the env_reset option, so this is unlikely to be
 mdeslaur> an issue in practice. Marking priority as low.
