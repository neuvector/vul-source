Description:
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a
 failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows
 information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser
 security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to
 authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security
 tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for
 backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured
 with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a
 workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links
 generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.
