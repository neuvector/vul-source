Description:
 stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. A
 crafted image file can trigger `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` attempt to
 double-free the out variable. This happens in `stbi__load_gif_main` because
 when the `layers * stride` value is zero the behavior is implementation
 defined, but common that realloc frees the old memory and returns null
 pointer. Since it attempts to double-free the memory a few lines below the
 first “free”, the issue can be potentially exploited only in a
 multi-threaded environment. In the worst case this may lead to code
 execution.
