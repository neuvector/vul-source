Description:
 SchedMD Slurm 21.08.x through 20.11.x has Incorrect Access Control that
 leads to Information Disclosure.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> According to upstream:
 ebarretto> "This issue impacts all Slurm releases since at least Slurm 1.0.0.
 ebarretto> Due to the severity of the CVE-2022-29500 issue, SchedMD has
 ebarretto> removed all prior Slurm releases from our download site.
 ebarretto> SchedMD only issues security fixes for the supported releases
 ebarretto> (currently 21.08 and 20.11). Due to the complexity of these fixes,
 ebarretto> we do not recommend attempting to backport the fixes to older
 ebarretto> releases, and strongly encourage sites to upgrade to fixed versions
 ebarretto> immediately."
 ebarretto> Therefore we won't be patching slurm-llnl
