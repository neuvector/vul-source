Description:
 Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Solr.
 
 Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by
 default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication
 bypass.
 A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to
 skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original
 URL Path.
 This fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped
 off internally after authentication but before API routing.
 
 
 This issue affects Apache Solr: from 5.3.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before
 9.7.0.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the
 issue.
