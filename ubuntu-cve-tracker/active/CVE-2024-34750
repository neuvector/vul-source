Description:
 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource
 Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2
 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers
 correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn
 led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections
 to remain open which should have been closed.
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90,
 which fixes the issue.
