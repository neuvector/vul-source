Description:
 Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and remote procedure call (RPC)
 system. Cap'n Proro prior to versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3, as
 well as versions of Cap'n Proto's Rust implementation prior to 0.13.7,
 0.14.11, and 0.15.2 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read due to logic error
 handling list-of-list. This issue may lead someone to remotely segfault a
 peer by sending it a malicious message, if the victim performs certain
 actions on a list-of-pointer type. Exfiltration of memory is possible if
 the victim performs additional certain actions on a list-of-pointer type.
 To be vulnerable, an application must perform a specific sequence of
 actions, described in the GitHub Security Advisory. The bug is present in
 inlined code, therefore the fix will require rebuilding dependent
 applications. Cap'n Proto has C++ fixes available in versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1,
 0.9.2, and 0.10.3. The `capnp` Rust crate has fixes available in versions
 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Per upstream: "Unfortunately, the bug is present in inlined
 mdeslaur> code, therefore the fix will require rebuilding dependent
 mdeslaur> applications."
 mdeslaur> "To be vulnerable, an application must perform a specific
 mdeslaur> sequence of actions, described below. At present, we are not
 mdeslaur> aware of any vulnerable application, but we advise updating
 mdeslaur> regardless."
 mdeslaur> capnproto is in main in bionic and focal only, and the only
 mdeslaur> reverse depends in main is mir
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The upstream fix introduces changes both to inline code and to
 mdeslaur> the library which means fixing this will break ABI. Due to the
 mdeslaur> likelyhood of breaking applications, and the fact that it is
 mdeslaur> unlikely applications do the specific sequence of actions
 mdeslaur> to trigger this vulnerability, we will not be fixing this issue
 mdeslaur> in Ubuntu.
