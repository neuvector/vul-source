Description:
 A flaw was found in libnbd. A malicious actor could exploit this by
 convincing libnbd to open a specially crafted Uniform Resource Identifier
 (URI). This vulnerability arises because non-standard hostnames starting
 with '-o' are incorrectly interpreted as arguments to the Secure Shell
 (SSH) process, rather than as hostnames. This could lead to arbitrary code
 execution with the privileges of the user running libnbd.
