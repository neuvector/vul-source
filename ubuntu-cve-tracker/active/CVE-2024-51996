Description:
 Symphony process is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which executes
 commands in sub-processes. When consuming a persisted remember-me cookie,
 Symfony does not check if the username persisted in the database matches
 the username attached with the cookie, leading to authentication bypass.
 This vulnerability is fixed in 5.4.47, 6.4.15, and 7.1.8.
