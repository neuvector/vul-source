Description:
 An issue was discovered in cp-demangle.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed
 in GNU Binutils 2.31. There is a stack consumption vulnerability resulting
 from infinite recursion in the functions d_name(), d_encoding(), and
 d_local_name() in cp-demangle.c. Remote attackers could leverage this
 vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via an ELF file, as demonstrated
 by nm.
