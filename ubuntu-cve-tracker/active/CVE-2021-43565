Description:
 The x/crypto/ssh package before 0.0.0-20211202192323-5770296d904e of
 golang.org/x/crypto allows an attacker to panic an SSH server.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> snapd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto
 jdstrand> lxd in 18.04 LTS and earlier contains an embedded copy of
  golang-go.crypto
 mdeslaur> snapd and lxd only use the terminal sub-package, not the ssh
 mdeslaur> part of golang-go.crypto, so they are not vulnerable
