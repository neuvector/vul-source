Description:
 tcp_emu in tcp_subr.c in libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, mismanages
 memory, as demonstrated by IRC DCC commands in EMU_IRC. This can cause a
 heap-based buffer overflow or other out-of-bounds access which can lead to
 a DoS or potential execute arbitrary code.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU
 emulator did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. An
 attacker could use this to cause a heap-based buffer overflow or other
 out-of-bounds access, which can lead to a denial of service (application
 crash) or potential execute arbitrary code.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> possible better approach would be to disable tcp_emu completely
