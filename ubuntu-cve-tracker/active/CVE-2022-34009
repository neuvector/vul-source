Description:
 Fossil 2.18 on Windows allows attackers to cause a denial of service
 (daemon crash) via an XSS payload in a ticket. This occurs because the
 ticket data is stored in a temporary file, and the product does not
 properly handle the absence of this file after Windows Defender has flagged
 it as malware.
