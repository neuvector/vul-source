Description:
 Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
 framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol
 servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a
 vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When
 netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur
 via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on
 the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is
 shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that
 do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to
 information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS
 Operating Systems. The method "File.createTempFile" on unix-like systems
 creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the
 permissions "-rw-r--r--". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this
 file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in
 netty's "AbstractDiskHttpData" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in
 version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own
 "java.io.tmpdir" when you start the JVM or use
 "DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)" to set the directory to something
 that is only readable by the current user.
