Description:
 An issue was discovered in Pidgin before 2.14.9. A remote attacker who can
 spoof DNS responses can redirect a client connection to a malicious server.
 The client will perform TLS certificate verification of the malicious
 domain name instead of the original XMPP service domain, allowing the
 attacker to take over control over the XMPP connection and to obtain user
 credentials and all communication content. This is similar to
 CVE-2022-24968.
