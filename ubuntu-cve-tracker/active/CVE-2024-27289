Description:
 pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. Prior to version 4.18.2, SQL
 injection can occur when all of the following conditions are met: the
 non-default simple protocol is used; a placeholder for a numeric value must
 be immediately preceded by a minus; there must be a second placeholder for
 a string value after the first placeholder; both must be on the same line;
 and both parameter values must be user-controlled. The problem is resolved
 in v4.18.2. As a workaround, do not use the simple protocol or do not place
 a minus directly before a placeholder.
