Description:
 Nextcloud Desktop is the desktop sync client for Nextcloud. In versions of
 Nextcloud Desktop prior to 3.15, 3rdparty applications already installed on
 a user machine can create link shares for almost all data via the socket
 API. These shares can then be easily sent off to an external service.
 Nextcloud Desktop fixes the issue in version 3.15. No known workarounds are
 available.
