Description:
 When a URL is added to the map element, it is recorded in the database with
 sequential IDs. Upon adding a new URL, the system retrieves the last
 sysmapelementurlid value and increments it by one. However, an issue arises
 when a user manually changes the sysmapelementurlid value by adding
 sysmapelementurlid + 1. This action prevents others from adding URLs to the
 map element.
