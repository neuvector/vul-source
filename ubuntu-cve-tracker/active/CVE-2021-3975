Description:
 A use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. The qemuMonitorUnregister()
 function in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF is called using multiple threads
 without being adequately protected by a monitor lock. This flaw could be
 triggered by the virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when the guest is shutting
 down. An unprivileged client with a read-only connection could use this
 flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to
 crash.
