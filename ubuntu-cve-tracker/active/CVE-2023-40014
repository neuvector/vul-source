Description:
 OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development.
 Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using
 `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender`
 return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with
 calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not
 appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for
 `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder
 the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all
 calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in
 v4.9.3.
