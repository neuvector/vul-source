Description:
 A flaw was identified in the NTLM authentication handling of the libsoup
 HTTP library, used by GNOME and other applications for network
 communication. When processing extremely long passwords, an internal size
 calculation can overflow due to improper use of signed integers. This
 results in incorrect memory allocation on the stack, followed by unsafe
 memory copying. As a result, applications using libsoup may crash
 unexpectedly, creating a denial-of-service risk.
