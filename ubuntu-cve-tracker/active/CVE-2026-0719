Description:
 A flaw was found in libsoup's NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication module.
 When NTLM authentication is enabled, a local attacker can exploit a
 stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the md4sum() function. This
 allows the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, which may result in
 arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the affected application.
