Description:
 XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 XStream before version 1.4.15, a Server-Side Forgery Request vulnerability
 can be activated when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote
 attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly
 available only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on
 XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use
 at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist if
 running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected who followed the
 recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist!
 Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a
 whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of
 XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can
 use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced advisories.
