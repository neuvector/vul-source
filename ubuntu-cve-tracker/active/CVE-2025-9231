Description:
 Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow remote
 recovery of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on
 64 bit
 ARM platforms.
 
 Impact summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64
 bit
 ARM platforms could allow recovering the private key by an attacker..
 
 While remote key recovery over a network was not attempted by the reporter,
 timing measurements revealed a timing signal which may allow such an
 attack.
 
 OpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS, and so
 this CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts.  However, given that it is
 possible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider,
 coupled
 with the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be
 recoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a
 Moderate
 severity issue.
 
 The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by
 this
 issue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm.
