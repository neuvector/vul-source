Description:
 Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a
 vulnerability in versions up to and including 4.1.118.Final. An unsafe
 reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in
 Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file
 that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty
 application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as
 CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that
 null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit
 d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.
