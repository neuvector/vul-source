Description:
 Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
 reusable PHP components. Symfony's HttpFoundation component defines an
 object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. Starting in version 2.0.0
 and prior to version 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class
 improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way that leads to representing
 some URLs with a path that doesn't start with a `/`. This can allow
 bypassing some access control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix
 assumption. Starting in versions 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request`
 class now ensures that URL paths always start with a `/`.
