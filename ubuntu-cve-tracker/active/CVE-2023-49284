Description:
 fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS, Linux, and
 the rest of the family. fish shell uses certain Unicode non-characters
 internally for marking wildcards and expansions. It will incorrectly allow
 these markers to be read on command substitution output, rather than
 transforming them into a safe internal representation. While this may cause
 unexpected behavior with direct input (for example, echo \UFDD2HOME has the
 same output as echo $HOME), this may become a minor security problem if the
 output is being fed from an external program into a command substitution
 where this output may not be expected. This design flaw was introduced in
 very early versions of fish, predating the version control system, and is
 thought to be present in every version of fish released in the last 15
 years or more, although with different characters. Code execution does not
 appear to be possible, but denial of service (through large brace
 expansion) or information disclosure (such as variable expansion) is
 potentially possible under certain circumstances. fish shell 3.6.2 has been
 released to correct this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this vulnerability.
