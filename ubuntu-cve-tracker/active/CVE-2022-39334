Description:
 Nextcloud also ships a CLI utility called nextcloudcmd which is sometimes
 used for automated scripting and headless servers. Versions of nextcloudcmd
 prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates, which may
 enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive data or
 credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not
 affect the standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect
 the Nextcloud server.
