Description:
 OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR
 file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In
 versions 3.3.2 through 3.3.0, there is a heap-based buffer overflow during
 a write operation when decompressing ZIPS-packed deep scan-line EXR files
 with a maliciously forged chunk header. This is fixed in version 3.3.3.
