Description:
 XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load
 and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the
 processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the
 recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist
 limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a
 blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.
