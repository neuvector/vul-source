Description:
 coreruleset (aka OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set) through 3.3.4 does not
 detect multiple Content-Type request headers on some platforms. This might
 allow attackers to bypass a WAF with a crafted payload, aka "Content-Type
 confusion" between the WAF and the backend application. This occurs when
 the web application relies on only the last Content-Type header. Other
 platforms may reject the additional Content-Type header or merge
 conflicting headers, leading to detection as a malformed header.
