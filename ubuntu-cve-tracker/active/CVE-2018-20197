Description:
 There is a stack-based buffer underflow in the third instance of the
 calculate_gain function in libfaad/sbr_hfadj.c in Freeware Advanced Audio
 Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. A crafted input will lead to a denial of service
 or possibly unspecified other impact because limiting the additional noise
 energy level is mishandled for the G_max > G case.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 incorrectly
 validated user input when processing crafted AAC files. An attacker
 could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other
 unspecified impact.
