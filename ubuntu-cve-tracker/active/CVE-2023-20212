Description:
 A vulnerability in the AutoIt module of ClamAV could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
 condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic error
 in the memory management of an affected device. An attacker could exploit
 this vulnerability by submitting a crafted AutoIt file to be scanned by
 ClamAV on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
 attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to restart unexpectedly,
 resulting in a DoS condition.
