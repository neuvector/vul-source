Description:
 The <code>ms-msdt</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>search-ms</code>
 protocols deliver content to Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser,
 when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had known
 vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited
 through Thunderbird), so in this release Thunderbird has blocked these
 protocols from prompting the user to open them.<br>*This bug only affects
 Thunderbird on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird <
 102, and Thunderbird < 91.11.
