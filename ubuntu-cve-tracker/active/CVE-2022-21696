Description:
 OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
 share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In
 affected versions it is possible to change the username to that of another
 chat participant with an additional space character at the end of the name
 string. An adversary with access to the chat environment can use the rename
 feature to impersonate other participants by adding whitespace characters
 at the end of the username.
