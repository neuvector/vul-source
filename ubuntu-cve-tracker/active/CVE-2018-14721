Description:
 FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to
 conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks by leveraging failure to
 block the axis2-jaxws class from polymorphic deserialization.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled 
 deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
 server-side request forgery (SSRF).
