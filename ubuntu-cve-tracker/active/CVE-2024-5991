Description:
 In function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL
 terminated string despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically,
 the function X509_check_host() takes in a pointer and length to check
 against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated. If a caller was
 attempting to do a name check on a non-NULL terminated buffer, the code
 would read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL
 terminator.This issue affects wolfSSL: through 5.7.0.
