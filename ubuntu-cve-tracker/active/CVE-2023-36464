Description:
 pypdf is an open source, pure-python PDF library. In affected versions an
 attacker may craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if
 `__parse_content_stream` is executed. That is, for example, the case if the
 user extracted text from such a PDF. This issue was introduced in pull
 request #969 and resolved in pull request #1828. Users are advised to
 upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may modify the line `while peek not in
 (b"\r", b"\n")` in `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py` to `while peek not
 in (b"\r", b"\n", b"")`.
