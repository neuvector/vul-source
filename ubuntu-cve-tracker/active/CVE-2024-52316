 https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/acc2f01395f895980f5d8a64573fcc1bade13369 (10.1.31)
 https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/7532f9dc4a8c37ec958f79dc82c4924a6c539223 (9.0.96)
Description:
 Unchecked Error Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. If Tomcat is
 configured to use a custom Jakarta Authentication (formerly
 JASPIC) ServerAuthContext component which may throw an exception during the
 authentication process without explicitly setting an HTTP status to
 indicate failure, the authentication may not fail, allowing the user to
 bypass the authentication process. There are no known
 Jakarta Authentication components that behave in this way.
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M26, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.30, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.95.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0, 10.1.31 or 9.0.96,
 which fix the issue.
