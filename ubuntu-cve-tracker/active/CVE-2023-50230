Description:
 BlueZ Phone Book Access Profile Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent
 attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of BlueZ.
 User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
 target must connect to a malicious Bluetooth device.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the handling of the Phone Book Access
 profile. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length
 of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based
 buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the
 context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20938.
