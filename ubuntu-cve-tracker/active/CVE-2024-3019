Description:
 A flaw was found in PCP. The default pmproxy configuration exposes the
 Redis server backend to the local network, allowing remote command
 execution with the privileges of the Redis user. This issue can only be
 exploited when pmproxy is running. By default, pmproxy is not running and
 needs to be started manually. The pmproxy service is usually started from
 the 'Metrics settings' page of the Cockpit web interface. This flaw affects
 PCP versions 4.3.4 and newer.
