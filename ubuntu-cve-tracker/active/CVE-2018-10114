Description:
 An issue was discovered in GEGL through 0.3.32. The
 gegl_buffer_iterate_read_simple function in buffer/gegl-buffer-access.c
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (write access
 violation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed PPM
 file, related to improper restrictions on memory allocation in the
 ppm_load_read_header function in operations/external/ppm-load.c.
