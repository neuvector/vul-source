Description:
 ssh in OpenSSH before 10.1 allows the '\0' character in an ssh:// URI,
 potentially leading to code execution when a ProxyCommand is used.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> openssh-ssh1 is only provided for compatibility with old devices
 mdeslaur> that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. We will not be
 mdeslaur> providing any security support for the openssh-ssh1 package as
 mdeslaur> it is insecure and should be used in trusted environments only.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> This issue is considered "minor" by the OpenSSH developers.
 mdeslaur> Also, it is not recommended to construct ssh commandlines from
 mdeslaur> untrusted usernames and URLs.
 mdeslaur> As such, setting priority as "low", this can be bundled in the
 mdeslaur> next round of OpenSSH security updates.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> When fixing this, also include username validity checking added
 mdeslaur> to 9.6.
