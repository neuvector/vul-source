Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** yasm 1.3.0.55.g101bc has a segmentation violation in the
 function delete_Token at modules/preprocs/nasm/nasm-pp.c. NOTE: although a
 libyasm application could become unavailable if this were exploited, the
 vendor's position is that there is no security relevance because there is
 either supposed to be input validation before data reaches libyasm, or a
 sandbox in which the application runs.
