Description:
 Applications that parse ETags from "If-Match" or "If-None-Match" request
 headers are vulnerable to DoS attack.
 
 Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed
 version.
 
 Users of older, unsupported versions could enforce a size limit on
 "If-Match" and "If-None-Match" headers, e.g. through a Filter.
