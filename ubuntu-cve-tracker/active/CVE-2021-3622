 A flaw was found in the hivex library. This flaw allows an attacker to
 input a specially crafted Windows Registry (hive) file, which would cause
 hivex to recursively call the _get_children() function, leading to a stack
 overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system
 availability.
