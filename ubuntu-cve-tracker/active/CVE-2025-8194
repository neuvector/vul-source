Description:
 There is a defect in the CPython “tarfile” module affecting the “TarFile”
 extraction and entry enumeration APIs. The tar implementation would process
 tar archives with negative offsets without error, resulting in an infinite
 loop and deadlock during the parsing of maliciously crafted tar archives.
 
 This vulnerability can be mitigated by including the following patch after
 importing the “tarfile” module:
