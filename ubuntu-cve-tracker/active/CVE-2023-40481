Description:
 7-Zip SquashFS File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of 7-Zip. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within
 the parsing of SQFS files. The issue results from the lack of proper
 validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end
 of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
 execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-18589.
