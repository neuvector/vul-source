Description:
 7-Zip SquashFS File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of 7-Zip. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SQFS files. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can
 result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can
 leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
 process. Was ZDI-CAN-18589.
