Description:
 A flaw was found in GNU Wget2. This vulnerability, a stack-based buffer
 overflow, occurs in the filename sanitization logic when processing
 attacker-controlled URL paths, particularly when filename restriction
 options are active. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a
 specially crafted URL, which, upon user interaction with wget2, can lead to
 memory corruption. This can cause the application to crash and potentially
 allow for further malicious activities.
