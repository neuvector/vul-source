Description:
 Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4,
 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository
 that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to
 arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target
 repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the
 filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same
 filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When
 cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the
 `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning
 will be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files
 instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic
 links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for
 CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link
 operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem
 appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the
 operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create
 hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable
 files. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4,
 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.
