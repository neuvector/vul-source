Description:
 When reading data from a hfs filesystem, grub's hfs filesystem module uses
 user-controlled parameters from the filesystem metadata to calculate the
 internal buffers size, however it misses to properly check for integer
 overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer
 size calculation to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc()
 operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the
 hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal
 buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal
 critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure
 boot protections.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
