Description:
 A flaw was found in libxml2, an XML parsing library. This uncontrolled
 recursion vulnerability occurs in the xmlCatalogXMLResolveURI function when
 an XML catalog contains a delegate URI entry that references itself. A
 remote attacker could exploit this configuration-dependent issue by
 providing a specially crafted XML catalog, leading to infinite recursion
 and call stack exhaustion. This ultimately results in a segmentation fault,
 causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing affected applications.
