Description:
 The unserialize() function supported a type code, "S", which was meant to
 be supported only for APC serialization. This type code allowed arbitrary
 memory addresses to be accessed as if they were static StringData objects.
 This issue affected HHVM prior to v4.32.3, between versions 4.33.0 and
 4.56.0, 4.57.0, 4.58.0, 4.58.1, 4.59.0, 4.60.0, 4.61.0, 4.62.0.
