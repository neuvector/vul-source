Description:
 Cargo downloads the Rust projectâ€™s dependencies and compiles the project.
 Cargo prior to version 0.72.2, bundled with Rust prior to version 1.71.1,
 did not respect the umask when extracting crate archives on UNIX-like
 systems. If the user downloaded a crate containing files writeable by any
 local user, another local user could exploit this to change the source code
 compiled and executed by the current user. To prevent existing cached
 extractions from being exploitable, the Cargo binary version 0.72.2
 included in Rust 1.71.1 or later will purge caches generated by older Cargo
 versions automatically. As a workaround, configure one's system to prevent
 other local users from accessing the Cargo directory, usually located in
 `~/.cargo`.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> cargo in mantic was merged into rustc
 alexmurray> requires an update to the tar rust dependency (tar 0.4.39) - this
   is packaged as rust-tar in Ubuntu but only the rust-cargo package appears to
   use this - rustc and cargo both vendor a copy of this package
 litios> a workaround for this issue is to prevent access to the ~/.cargo
   directory to other users.
