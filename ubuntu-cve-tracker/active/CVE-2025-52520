Description:
 For some unlikely configurations of multipart upload, an Integer Overflow
 vulnerability in Apache Tomcat could lead to a DoS via bypassing of size
 limits.
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.8, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.42, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.106.
 The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are
 known to be affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions
 may also be affected.
 
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.9, 10.1.43 or 9.0.107,
 which fix the issue.
