Description:
 The Candid library causes a Denial of Service while
 parsing a specially crafted payload with 'empty' data type. For example,
  if the payload is `record { * ; empty }` and the canister interface
 expects `record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as an
 extra field required by the type.  The problem with the type empty is that
 the candid Rust library wrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable error
 when skipping the field and thus causing an infinite decoding loop.
 
 
 Canisters using affected versions of candid
  are exposed to denial of service by causing the decoding to run
 indefinitely until the canister traps due to reaching maximum
 instruction limit per execution round. Repeated exposure to the payload
 will result in degraded performance of the canister. Note: Canisters
 written in Motoko are unaffected.
