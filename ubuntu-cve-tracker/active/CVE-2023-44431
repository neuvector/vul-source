Description:
 BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via Bluetooth on affected
 installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this
 vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious device. The
 specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
 data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker
 can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
 Was ZDI-CAN-19909.
