Description:
 BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via Bluetooth on affected installations of BlueZ.
 User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
 target must connect to a malicious device. The specific flaw exists within
 the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue results from the lack of
 proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it
 to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
 vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19909.
