Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in Bootstrap that exposes users to
 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The issue is present in the carousel
 component, where the data-slide and data-slide-to attributes can be
 exploited through the href attribute of an <a> tag due to inadequate
 sanitization. This vulnerability could potentially enable attackers to
 execute arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's browser.
