Description:
 A vulnerability exists in the inftrees.c component of the zlib library,
 which is bundled within the PointCloudLibrary (PCL). This issue may allow
 context-dependent attackers to cause undefined behavior by exploiting
 improper pointer arithmetic.
 
 Since version 1.14.0, PCL by default uses a zlib installation from the
 system, unless the user sets WITH_SYSTEM_ZLIB=FALSE. So this potential
 vulnerability is only relevant if the PCL version is older than 1.14.0 or
 the user specifically requests to not use the system zlib.
