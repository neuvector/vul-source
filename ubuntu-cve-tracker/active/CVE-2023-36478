Description:
 Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions
 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52,
 an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK
 header values to
 exceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name
 or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is
 exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the
 multiplication by 4 in line 295
 will overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now
 be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore,
 `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value
 sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation
 later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if
 a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value
 which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this
 length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the
 user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of
 HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has
 been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known
 workarounds.
