Description:
 Wire-server is the system server for the wire back-end services. Releases
 prior to v2022-03-01 are subject to a denial of service attack via a
 crafted object causing a hash collision. This collision causes the server
 to spend at least quadratic time parsing it which can lead to a denial of
 service for a heavily used server. The issue has been fixed in wire-server
 2022-03-01 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise
 instances of wire-server need to be updated to 2022-03-01, so that their
 backends are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this
 issue.
