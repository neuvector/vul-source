Description:
 Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers.
 In version 1.6.5 and prior, cache-backed state/request-token storage is not
 tied to the initiating user session, so CSRF is possible for any attacker
 that has a valid state (easily obtainable via an attacker-initiated
 authentication flow). When a cache is supplied to the OAuth client
 registry, FrameworkIntegration.set_state_data writes the entire state blob
 under _state_{app}_{state}, and get_state_data ignores the caller’s session
 altogether. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6.
