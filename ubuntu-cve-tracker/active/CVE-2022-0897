Description:
 A flaw was found in the libvirt nwfilter driver. The
 virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters method failed to acquire the
 driver->nwfilters mutex before iterating over virNWFilterObj instances.
 There was no protection to stop another thread from concurrently modifying
 the driver->nwfilters object. This flaw allows a malicious, unprivileged
 user to exploit this issue via libvirt's API virConnectNumOfNWFilters to
 crash the network filter management daemon (libvirtd/virtnwfilterd).
