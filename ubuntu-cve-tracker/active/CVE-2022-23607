Description:
 treq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of
 Twisted's Agents. Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`, etc.)
 and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor accept cookies as a dictionary.
 Such cookies are not bound to a single domain, and are therefore sent to
 *every* domain ("supercookies"). This can potentially cause sensitive
 information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain., e.g.
 should `https://example.com` redirect to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com`
 the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind
 cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`,
 `HTTPClient.request`, `HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the *url*
 parameter. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade
 Instead of passing a dictionary as the *cookies* argument, pass a
 `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-scoped
 cookies in it.
