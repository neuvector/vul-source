Description:
 XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
 remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only
 by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who
 followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a
 whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's
 default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least
 version 1.4.16.
