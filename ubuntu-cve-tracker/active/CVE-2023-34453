Description:
 snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked
 multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to
 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error. The function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the
 file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit
 shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to
 the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the
 multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller
 value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a
 negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will
 raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or
 too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will
 assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as
 `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The same issue exists also when
 using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short,
 each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue. Version
 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.
