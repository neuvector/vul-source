Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A guest may access xenstore
 paths via absolute paths containing a full pathname, or via a relative
 path, which implicitly includes /local/domain/$DOMID for their own domain
 id. Management tools must access paths in guests' namespaces, necessarily
 using absolute paths. oxenstored imposes a pathname limit that is applied
 solely to the relative or absolute path specified by the client. Therefore,
 a guest can create paths in its own namespace which are too long for
 management tools to access. Depending on the toolstack in use, a malicious
 guest administrator might cause some management tools and debugging
 operations to fail. For example, a guest administrator can cause
 "xenstore-ls -r" to fail. However, a guest administrator cannot prevent the
 host administrator from tearing down the domain. All systems using
 oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the default in
 the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems
 using C xenstored are not vulnerable.
