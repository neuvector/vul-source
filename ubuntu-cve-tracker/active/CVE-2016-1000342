Description:
 In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier ECDSA does not
 fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible
 to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still
 have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of
 'invisible' data into a signed structure.
