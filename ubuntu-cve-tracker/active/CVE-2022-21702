Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In
 affected versions an attacker could serve HTML content thru the Grafana
 datasource or plugin proxy and trick a user to visit this HTML page using a
 specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. The
 attacker could either compromise an existing datasource for a specific
 Grafana instance or either set up its own public service and instruct
 anyone to set it up in their Grafana instance. To be impacted, all of the
 following must be applicable. For the data source proxy: A Grafana
 HTTP-based datasource configured with Server as Access Mode and a URL set,
 the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of
 above datasource, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker
 controlled data source must be clicked on by an authenticated user. For the
 plugin proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based app plugin configured and enabled with a
 URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the
 URL of above app, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker
 controlled plugin must be clocked on by an authenticated user. For the
 backend plugin resource: An attacker must be able to navigate an
 authenticated user to a compromised plugin through a crafted link. Users
 are advised to update to a patched version. There are no known workarounds
 for this vulnerability.
