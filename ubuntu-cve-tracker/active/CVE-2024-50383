Description:
 Botan before 3.6.0, when certain GCC versions are used, has a
 compiler-induced secret-dependent operation in lib/utils/donna128.h in
 donna128 (used in Chacha-Poly1305 and x25519). An addition can be skipped
 if a carry is not set. This was observed for GCC 11.3.0 with -O2 on MIPS,
 and GCC on x86-i386. (Only 32-bit processors can be affected.)
