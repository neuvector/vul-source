Description:
 A parsing issue with binary data in protobuf-java core and lite versions
 prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of service
 attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded
 messages with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted
 back-n-forth between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially
 long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating to the versions
 mentioned above.
