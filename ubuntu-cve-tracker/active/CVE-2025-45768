Description:
 pyjwt v2.10.1 was discovered to contain weak encryption. NOTE: this is
 disputed by the Supplier because the key length is chosen by the
 application that uses the library (admittedly, library users may benefit
 from a minimum value and a mechanism for opting in to strict enforcement).
