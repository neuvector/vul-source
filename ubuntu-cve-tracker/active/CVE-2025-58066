Description:
 nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer's clock, implementing the
 NTP and NTS protocols. In versions between 1.2.0 and 1.6.1 inclusive
 servers which allow non-NTS traffic are affected by a denial of service
 vulnerability, where an attacker can induce a message storm between two NTP
 servers running ntpd-rs. Client-only configurations are not affected.
 Affected users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.2 as soon as
 possible.
