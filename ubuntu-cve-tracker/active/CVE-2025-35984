Description:
 A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the PCX Image Decoding
 functionality of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When decoding the
 image data from a specially crafted .pcx file, a heap-based buffer overflow
 can occur which allows for remote code execution. An attacker will need to
 convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.
