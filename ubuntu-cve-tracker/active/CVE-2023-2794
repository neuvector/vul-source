Description:
 A flaw was found in ofono, an Open Source Telephony on Linux. A stack
 overflow bug is triggered within the decode_deliver() function during the
 SMS decoding. It is assumed that the attack scenario is accessible from a
 compromised modem, a malicious base station, or just SMS. There is a bound
 check for this memcpy length in decode_submit(), but it was forgotten in
 decode_deliver().
