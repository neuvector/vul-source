Description:
 The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15,
 and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via
 insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file
 whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This
 is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not
 symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to
 determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when
 directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar
 files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as
 the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being
 created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is
 present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that
 directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for
 symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that
 directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink
 checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to
 symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary
 files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and
 overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and
 6.1.2.
