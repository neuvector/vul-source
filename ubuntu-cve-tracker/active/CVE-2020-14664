Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: JavaFX).
 The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 8u251. Difficult to
 exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access
 via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require
 human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the
 vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional
 products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover
 of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically
 in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
 applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
 internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
 does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
 only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base
 Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS
 Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
