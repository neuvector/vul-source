Description:
 Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. In
 versions prior to 4.1.128.Final and 4.2.7.Final, the SMTP codec in Netty
 contains an SMTP command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input
 validation for Carriage Return (\r) and Line Feed (\n) characters in
 user-supplied parameters. The vulnerability exists in
 io.netty.handler.codec.smtp.DefaultSmtpRequest, where parameters are
 directly concatenated into the SMTP command string without sanitization.
 When methods such as SmtpRequests.rcpt(recipient) are called with a
 malicious string containing CRLF sequences, attackers can inject arbitrary
 SMTP commands. Because the injected commands are sent from the server's
 trusted IP address, resulting emails will likely pass SPF and DKIM
 authentication checks, making them appear legitimate. This allows remote
 attackers who can control SMTP command parameters (such as email
 recipients) to forge arbitrary emails from the trusted server, potentially
 impersonating executives and forging high-stakes corporate communications.
 This issue has been patched in versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final. No
 known workarounds exist.
