Description:
 Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network
 via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In versions up to and including
 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and
 accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although
 `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and
 `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`.
 There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a
 result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally
 error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon
 memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for
 mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load
 caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc
 calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local
 addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are
 available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some
 workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package
 functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket
 `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are
 not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and
 avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is
 possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is
 started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it.
 Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools
 to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users.
