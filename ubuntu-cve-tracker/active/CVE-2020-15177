Description:
 In GLPI before version 9.5.2, the `install/install.php` endpoint insecurely
 stores user input into the database as `url_base` and `url_base_api`. These
 settings are referenced throughout the application and allow for
 vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Redirection Since
 authentication is not required to perform these changes,anyone could point
 these fields at malicious websites or form input in a way to trigger XSS.
 Leveraging JavaScript it's possible to steal cookies, perform actions as
 the user, etc. The issue is patched in version 9.5.2.
