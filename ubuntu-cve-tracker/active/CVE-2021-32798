Description:
 The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
 computing. In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on
 load. Jupyter Notebook uses a deprecated version of Google Caja to sanitize
 user inputs. A public Caja bypass can be used to trigger an XSS when a
 victim opens a malicious ipynb document in Jupyter Notebook. The XSS allows
 an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim computer using Jupyter
 APIs.
