Description:
 Mechanize is an open-source ruby library that makes automated web
 interaction easy. In Mechanize from version 2.0.0 and before version 2.7.7
 there is a command injection vulnerability. Affected versions of mechanize
 allow for OS commands to be injected using several classes' methods which
 implicitly use Ruby's Kernel.open method. Exploitation is possible only if
 untrusted input is used as a local filename and passed to any of these
 calls: Mechanize::CookieJar#load, Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as,
 Mechanize#download, Mechanize::Download#save, Mechanize::File#save, and
 Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body. This is fixed in version 2.7.7.
