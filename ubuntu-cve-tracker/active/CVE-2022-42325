Description:
 Xenstore: Guests can create arbitrary number of nodes via transactions
 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains
 which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] In case a node has
 been created in a transaction and it is later deleted in the same
 transaction, the transaction will be terminated with an error. As this
 error is encountered only when handling the deleted node at transaction
 finalization, the transaction will have been performed partially and
 without updating the accounting information. This will enable a malicious
 guest to create arbitrary number of nodes.
