Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In
 affected versions when a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature
 enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token (and no other
 user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently
 logged-in user. This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which
 they may not have intended access. This attack relies on the Grafana
 instance having data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity
 feature, the Grafana instance having a data source with the Forward OAuth
 Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana instance having OAuth enabled, and
 the Grafana instance having usable API keys. This issue has been patched in
 versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4.
