 non-boolean CLI arguments (e.g. `--delim`, `--buf-size`, `--manpath`) are
 passed through python's `eval`, allowing arbitrary code execution. This
 issue is only locally exploitable and had been addressed in release version
 4.66.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
 for this vulnerability.
