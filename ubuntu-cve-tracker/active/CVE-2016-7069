Description:
 An issue has been found in dnsdist before 1.2.0 in the way EDNS0 OPT
 records are handled when parsing responses from a backend. When dnsdist is
 configured to add EDNS Client Subnet to a query, the response may contain
 an EDNS0 OPT record that has to be removed before forwarding the response
 to the initial client. On a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when
 parsing the received response to remove that record might trigger an
 undefined behavior leading to a crash.
