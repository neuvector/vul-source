Notes:
 mdeslaur> as of 2022-03-04, no upstream fix
 ccdm94> as of 2022-11-24, no upstream fix is available. A
 ccdm94> comment has been made in the issue bug requesting 
 ccdm94> that the issue be closed given that for ijg-libjpeg
 ccdm94> versions after 9c the vulnerability seems to not be
 ccdm94> reproducible with the provided PoC file. A discussion
 ccdm94> on whether this is a libtiff issue or a libjpeg issue
 ccdm94> can be seen in a few comments in the bug report. The
 ccdm94> vulnerability also does not reproduce in xenial nor
 ccdm94> does it reproduce in kinetic.
