 https://github.com/cpan-authors/YAML-Syck/commit/dcf4c8477b82ef439f43fd20dc099082d096df02 (v1.36)
Description:
 YAML::Syck versions before 1.36 for Perl has missing null-terminators which
 causes out-of-bounds read and potential information disclosure
 
 Missing null terminators in token.c leads to but-of-bounds read which
 allows adjacent variable to be read
 
 The issue is seen with complex YAML files with a hash of all keys and empty
 values.  There is no indication that the issue leads to accessing memory
 outside that allocated to the module.
