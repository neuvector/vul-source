Description:
 A vulnerability in Google Cloud Platform's guest-oslogin versions between
 20190304 and 20200507 allows a user that is only granted the role
 "roles/compute.osLogin" to escalate privileges to root. Using the
 membership to the "lxd" group, an attacker can attach host devices and
 filesystems. Within an lxc container, it is possible to attach the host OS
 filesystem and modify /etc/sudoers to then gain administrative privileges.
 All images created after 2020-May-07 (20200507) are fixed, and if you
 cannot update, we recommend you edit /etc/group/security.conf and remove
 the "lxd" user from the OS Login entry.
