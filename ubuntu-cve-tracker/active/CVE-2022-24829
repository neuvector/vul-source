Description:
 Garden is an automation platform for Kubernetes development and testing. In
 versions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not require
 authentication. In some operating modes this allows for an attacker to gain
 access to the application erroneously. The configuration is leaked through
 the /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving the
 Garden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which
 makes it accessible to anyone on the same network (or anyone on the
 internet if they are on a public, static IP). This may lead to the ability
 to compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users are
 advised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to
 upgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all
 untrusted network machines.
