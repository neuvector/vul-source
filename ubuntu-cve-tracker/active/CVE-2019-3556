Description:
 HHVM supports the use of an "admin" server which accepts administrative
 requests over HTTP. One of those request handlers, dump-pcre-cache, can be
 used to output cached regular expressions from the current execution
 context into a file. The handler takes a parameter which specifies where on
 the filesystem to write this data. The parameter is not validated, allowing
 a malicious user to overwrite arbitrary files where the user running HHVM
 has write access. This issue affects HHVM versions prior to 4.56.2, all
 versions between 4.57.0 and 4.78.0, as well as 4.79.0, 4.80.0, 4.81.0,
 4.82.0, and 4.83.0.
