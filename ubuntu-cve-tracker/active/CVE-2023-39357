Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. A defect in the sql_save function was discovered. When the
 column type is numeric, the sql_save function directly utilizes user input.
 Many files and functions calling the sql_save function do not perform prior
 validation of user input, leading to the existence of multiple SQL
 injection vulnerabilities in Cacti. This allows authenticated users to
 exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation
 and remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25.
 Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
