Description:
 Scrapy versions up to 2.13.2 are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS)
 attack due to a flaw in its brotli decompression implementation. The
 protection mechanism against decompression bombs fails to mitigate the
 brotli variant, allowing remote servers to crash clients with less than
 80GB of available memory. This occurs because brotli can achieve extremely
 high compression ratios for zero-filled data, leading to excessive memory
 consumption during decompression.

Notes:
 hlibk> The fix for this CVE requires a new feature in brotli version 1.2.0.
