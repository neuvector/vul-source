Description:
 Cargo downloads a Rust projectâ€™s dependencies and compiles the project.
 Starting in Rust 1.60.0 and prior to 1.72, Cargo did not escape Cargo
 feature names when including them in the report generated by `cargo build
 --timings`. A malicious package included as a dependency may inject nearly
 arbitrary HTML here, potentially leading to cross-site scripting if the
 report is subsequently uploaded somewhere. The vulnerability affects users
 relying on dependencies from git, local paths, or alternative registries.
 Users who solely depend on crates.io are unaffected. Rust 1.60.0 introduced
 `cargo build --timings`, which produces a report of how long the different
 steps of the build process took. It includes lists of Cargo features for
 each crate. Prior to Rust 1.72, Cargo feature names were allowed to contain
 almost any characters (with some exceptions as used by the feature syntax),
 but it would produce a future incompatibility warning about them since Rust
 1.49. crates.io is far more stringent about what it considers a valid
 feature name and has not allowed such feature names. As the feature names
 were included unescaped in the timings report, they could be used to inject
 Javascript into the page, for example with a feature name like `features =
 ["<img src='' onerror=alert(0)"]`. If this report were subsequently
 uploaded to a domain that uses credentials, the injected Javascript could
 access resources from the website visitor. This issue was fixed in Rust
 1.72 by turning the future incompatibility warning into an error. Users
 should still exercise care in which package they download, by only
 including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even
 with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code
 execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a
 malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these
 vulnerabilities. crates.io has server-side checks preventing this attack,
 and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities.
 crates.io users still need to excercise care in choosing their dependencies
 though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.
