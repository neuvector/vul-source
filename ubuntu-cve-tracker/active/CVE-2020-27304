Description:
 The CivetWeb web library does not validate uploaded filepaths when running
 on an OS other than Windows, when using the built-in HTTP form-based file
 upload mechanism, via the mg_handle_form_request API. Web applications that
 use the file upload form handler, and use parts of the user-controlled
 filename in the output path, are susceptible to directory traversal
