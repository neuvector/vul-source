Description:
 GLPI stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique. GLPI is a Free
 Asset and IT Management Software package that provides ITIL Service Desk
 features, licenses tracking and software auditing. External links are not
 properly sanitized and can therefore be used for a Cross-Site Scripting
 (XSS) attack. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to GLPI 10.0.4.
 There are currently no known workarounds.
