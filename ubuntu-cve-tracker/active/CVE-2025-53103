Description:
 JUnit is a testing framework for Java and the JVM. From version 5.12.0 to
 5.13.1, JUnit's support for writing Open Test Reporting XML files can leak
 Git credentials. The impact depends on the level of the access token
 exposed through the OpenTestReportGeneratingListener. If these test reports
 are published or stored anywhere public, then there is the possibility that
 a rouge attacker can steal the token and perform elevated actions by
 impersonating the user or app. This issue as been patched in version
 5.13.2.
