Description:
 An issue was discovered in the FIPS Java API of Bouncy Castle BC-FJA before
 1.0.2.4. Changes to the JVM garbage collector in Java 13 and later trigger
 an issue in the BC-FJA FIPS modules where it is possible for temporary keys
 used by the module to be zeroed out while still in use by the module,
 resulting in errors or potential information loss. NOTE: FIPS compliant
 users are unaffected because the FIPS certification is only for Java 7, 8,
 and 11.
