Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.8, DNS
 resource name compression can lead to small DNS messages containing very
 large hostnames which can be costly to decode, and lead to very large DNS
 log records. While there are limits in place, they were too generous. The
 issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.8.
