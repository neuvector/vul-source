Description:
 OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
 Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, when the function `append_hf` handles a
 SIP message with a malformed To header, a call to the function `abort()` is
 performed, resulting in a crash. This is due to the following check in
 `data_lump.c:399` in the function `anchor_lump`. An attacker abusing this
 vulnerability will crash OpenSIPS leading to Denial of Service. It affects
 configurations containing functions that make use of the affected code,
 such as the function `append_hf`. This issue has been fixed in versions
 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.
