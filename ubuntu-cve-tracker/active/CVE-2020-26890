Description:
 Matrix Synapse before 1.20.0 erroneously permits non-standard NaN,
 Infinity, and -Infinity JSON values in fields of m.room.member events,
 allowing remote attackers to execute a denial of service attack against the
 federation and common Matrix clients. If such a malformed event is accepted
 into the room's state, the impact is long-lasting and is not fixed by an
 upgrade to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually redacted
 instead. Since events are replicated to servers of other room members, the
 impact is not constrained to the server of the event sender.
