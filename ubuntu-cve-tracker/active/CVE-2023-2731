Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in Libtiff's LZWDecode() function
 in the libtiff/tif_lzw.c file. This flaw allows a local attacker to craft
 specific input data that can cause the program to dereference a NULL
 pointer when decompressing a TIFF format file, resulting in a program crash
 or denial of service.
