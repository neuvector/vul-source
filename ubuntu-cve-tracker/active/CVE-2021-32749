Description:
 fail2ban is a daemon to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication
 errors. In versions 0.9.7 and prior, 0.10.0 through 0.10.6, and 0.11.0
 through 0.11.2, there is a vulnerability that leads to possible remote code
 execution in the mailing action mail-whois. Command `mail` from mailutils
 package used in mail actions like `mail-whois` can execute command if
 unescaped sequences (`\n~`) are available in "foreign" input (for instance
 in whois output). To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to
 insert malicious characters into the response sent by the whois server,
 either via a MITM attack or by taking over a whois server. The issue is
 patched in versions 0.10.7 and 0.11.3. As a workaround, one may avoid the
 usage of action `mail-whois` or patch the vulnerability manually.
