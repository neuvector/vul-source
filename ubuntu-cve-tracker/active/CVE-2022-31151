Description:
 Authorization headers are cleared on cross-origin redirect. However, cookie
 headers which are sensitive headers and are official headers found in the
 spec, remain uncleared. There are active users using cookie headers in
 undici. This may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a 3rd-party site
 or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open
 redirector) to leak the cookie to the 3rd party site. This was patched in
 v5.7.1. By default, this vulnerability is not exploitable. Do not enable
 redirections, i.e. `maxRedirections: 0` (the default).
