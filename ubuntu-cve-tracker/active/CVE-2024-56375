Description:
 An integer underflow was discovered in Fort 1.6.3 and 1.6.4 before 1.6.5. A
 malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can
 serve (via rsync or RRDP) a Manifest RPKI object containing an empty
 fileList. Fort dereferences (and, shortly afterwards, writes to) this array
 during a shuffle attempt, before the validation that would normally reject
 it when empty. This out-of-bounds access is caused by an integer underflow
 that causes the surrounding loop to iterate infinitely. Because the product
 is permanently stuck attempting to overshuffle an array that doesn't
 actually exist, a crash is nearly guaranteed.
