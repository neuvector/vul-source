Description:
 A flaw was found in the GIF parser of GdkPixbufâ€™s LZW decoder. When an
 invalid symbol is encountered during decompression, the decoder sets the
 reported output size to the full buffer length rather than the actual
 number of written bytes. This logic error results in uninitialized sections
 of the buffer being included in the output, potentially leaking arbitrary
 memory contents in the processed image.
