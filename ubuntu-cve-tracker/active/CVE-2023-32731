Description:
 When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it skipped
 parsing the rest of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK table mutations
 to also be skipped, resulting in a desynchronization of HPACK tables
 between sender and receiver. If leveraged, say, between a proxy and a
 backend, this could lead to requests from the proxy being interpreted as
 containing headers from different proxy clients - leading to an information
 leak that can be used for privilege escalation or data exfiltration. We
 recommend upgrading beyond the commit contained inÂ
