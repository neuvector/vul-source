Description:
 Dmidecode before 3.5 allows -dump-bin to overwrite a local file. This has
 security relevance because, for example, execution of Dmidecode via Sudo is
 plausible. NOTE: Some third parties have indicated the fix in 3.5 does not
 adequately address the vulnerability. The argument is that the proposed
 patch prevents dmidecode from writing to an existing file. However, there
 are multiple attack vectors that would not require overwriting an existing
 file that would provide the same level of unauthorized privilege escalation
 (e.g. creating a new file in /etc/cron.hourly).

Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> cpu-x embedds dmidecode source
 mdeslaur> This CVE relies on an improbable non-default configuration of
 mdeslaur> allowing an unprivileged user to run demidecode under sudo with
 mdeslaur> a specific insecure configuration in the sudoers file. Using
 mdeslaur> dmidecode in such a manner is no different than allowing any
 mdeslaur> other tool to unexpectedly run with elevated privileges. Setting
 mdeslaur> priority to low.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The upstream commits listed below only prevent overwriting a
 mdeslaur> file as root, but still allows creating arbitrary files as root
 mdeslaur> so using dmidecode with elevated privileges via sudoers is still
 mdeslaur> unsafe.
Mitigation:
 Do not configure sudoers file to allow running dmidecode with elevated
 privileges.
