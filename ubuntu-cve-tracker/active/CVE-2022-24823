Description:
 Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
 framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version
 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's
 multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the
 local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk
 is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and
 lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like
 systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the
 system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains
 a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own
 `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use
 DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something
 that is only readable by the current user.
