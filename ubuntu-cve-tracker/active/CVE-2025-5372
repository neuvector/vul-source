Description:
 A flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than
 3.0, specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation.
 Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to
 indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for successâ€”the function may mistakenly
 return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in
 uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent
 communication, potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality,
 integrity, and availability.
