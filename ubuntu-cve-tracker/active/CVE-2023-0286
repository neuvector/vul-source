Description:
 There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address
 processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an
 ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
 incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This
 field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp
 as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled
 (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this
 vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp
 call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service.
 In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the
 certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature.
 If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must
 already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
 uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
 applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving
 CRLs over a network.
