Description:
 In  https://github.com/google/nftables  IP addresses were encoded in the
 wrong byte order, resulting in an nftables configuration which does not
 work as intended (might block or not block the desired addresses).
 
 This issue affects:  https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/nftables@v0.1.0
 
 The bug was fixed in the next released version: 
 https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/nftables@v0.2.0
