Description:
 Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over
 IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the
 membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they
 know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with
 `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be
 using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server
 administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the
 patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a
 reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality,
 block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at`
 query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members`
 with `at` query parameter.
