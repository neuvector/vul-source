Description:
 URI.js is a Javascript URL mutation library. Before version 1.19.9,
 whitespace characters are not removed from the beginning of the protocol,
 so URLs are not parsed properly. This issue has been patched in version
 1.19.9. Removing leading whitespace from values before passing them to
 URI.parse can be used as a workaround.
