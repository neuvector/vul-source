 of data integrity.

Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> most of the processors listed in the SB were found
  in upstream version: 2025-07-29
 rodrigo-zaiden> This is not planned to be fixed for the amd64-microcode
  package in Ubuntu 14.04 as that release was already outside of the LTS
  timeframe when this hardware platform was launched.
