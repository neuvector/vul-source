Description:
 GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements
 NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, multiple out-of-bounds reads
 when decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of service. A 32-bit integer
 overflow condition can lead to incorrect checks of consistency of length of
 internal buffers. Although most applications will error out before
 accepting a singe input buffer of 4GB in length this could theoretically
 happen. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main
 `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the application allows tokens
 greater than 4GB in length. This can lead to a large, up to 65KB,
 out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-service if it reads from
 unmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch for the out-of-bounds
 reads.
