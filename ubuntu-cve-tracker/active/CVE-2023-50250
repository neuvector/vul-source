Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. A reflection cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered
 in version 1.2.25. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to perform
 actions on behalf of other users. The vulnerability is found in
 `templates_import.php.` When uploading an xml template file, if the XML
 file does not pass the check, the server will give a JavaScript pop-up
 prompt, which contains unfiltered xml template file name, resulting in XSS.
 An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf
 of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to
 unauthorized changes to settings. As of time of publication, no patched
 versions are available.
