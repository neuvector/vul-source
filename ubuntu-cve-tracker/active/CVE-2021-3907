Description:
 OctoRPKI does not escape a URI with a filename containing "..", this allows
 a repository to create a file, (ex.
 rsync://example.org/repo/../../etc/cron.daily/evil.roa), which would then
 be written to disk outside the base cache folder. This could allow for
 remote code execution on the host machine OctoRPKI is running on.

 ej7367> Although the CVE description only mentions OctoRPKI, fort-validator
