Description:
 An authenticated user without any specific authorizations may be able to
 repeatedly invoke the features command where at a high volume may lead to
 resource depletion or generate high lock contention. This may result in
 denial of service and in rare cases could result in id field collisions.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> the `oidReset` command implementation has existed
   in a couple of different locations in mongodb history,
   in src/mongo/db/commands/generic.cpp during 3.6.x and
   src/mongo/db/dbcommands_generic.cpp in 2.x timeframe. All of those
   implementations of `oidReset` lack an authorization requirement.
 sbeattie> all of the upstream commits for this issue are on branches
   licensed under mongodb's SSPL, which makes backporting them to
   GNU Affero licensed versions problematic.
