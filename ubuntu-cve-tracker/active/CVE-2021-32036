Description:
 An authenticated user without any specific authorizations may be able to
 repeatedly invoke the features command where at a high volume may lead to
 resource depletion or generate high lock contention. This may result in
 denial of service and in rare cases could result in id field collisions.
 This issue affects MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to and including
 5.0.3; MongoDB Server v4.4 versions prior to and including 4.4.9; MongoDB
 Server v4.2 versions prior to and including 4.2.16 and MongoDB Server v4.0
 versions prior to and including 4.0.28
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> the `oidReset` command implementation has existed
   in a couple of different locations in mongodb history,
   in src/mongo/db/commands/generic.cpp during 3.6.x and
   src/mongo/db/dbcommands_generic.cpp in 2.x timeframe. All of those
   implementations of `oidReset` lack an authorization requirement.
 sbeattie> all of the upstream commits for this issue are on branches
   licensed under mongodb's SSPL, which makes backporting them to
   GNU Affero licensed versions problematic.
