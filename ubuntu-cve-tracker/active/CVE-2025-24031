Description:
 PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate
 based user login. In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module
 segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN.
 When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the
 password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an
 uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value
 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most
 likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact
 due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch
 for the issue is unavailable.
