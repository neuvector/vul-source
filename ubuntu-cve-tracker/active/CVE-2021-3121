 https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/compare/v1.3.1...v1.3.2
Description:
 An issue was discovered in GoGo Protobuf before 1.3.2.
 plugin/unmarshal/unmarshal.go lacks certain index validation, aka the
 "skippy peanut butter" issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> still need to sort which of all of the golang sources that
   build-depend on golang-gogoprotobuf-dev and
   golang-github-gogo-protobuf-dev need to be rebuilt.
 sbeattie> not sure how the 1.2.1 -> 1.3.0 transition plays out
   here, it may be that some build dependencies had not been built
   yet with 1.3 .pb.go files, and rebuilding them in hirsute might
   trigger that. See https://github.com/gogo/protobuf#release-v130
   for discussion on potential compatibility issues
