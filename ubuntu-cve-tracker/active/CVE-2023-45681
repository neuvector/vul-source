Description:
 stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis
 files. A crafted file may trigger memory write past an allocated heap
 buffer in `start_decoder`. The root cause is a potential integer overflow
 in `sizeof(char*) * (f->comment_list_length)` which may make `setup_malloc`
 allocate less memory than required. Since there is another integer overflow
 an attacker may overflow it too to force `setup_malloc` to return 0 and
 make the exploit more reliable. This issue may lead to code execution.
