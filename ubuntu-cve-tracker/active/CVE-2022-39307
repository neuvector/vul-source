Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When
 using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the
 `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the username or email does
 not exist, a JSON response contains a “user not found” message. This leaks
 information to unauthenticated users and introduces a security risk. This
 issue has been patched in 9.2.4 and backported to 8.5.15. There are no
 known workarounds.
