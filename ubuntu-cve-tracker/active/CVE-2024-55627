Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to 7.0.8, a specially
 crafted TCP stream can lead to a very large buffer overflow while being
 zero-filled during initialization with memset due to an unsigned integer
 underflow. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.8.
