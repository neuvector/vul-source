Description:
 A jQuery cross site scripting vulnerability is present when making Ajax
 requests to untrusted domains. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact
 that it requires contributed or custom modules in order to exploit. For
 Drupal 8, this vulnerability was already fixed in Drupal 8.4.0 in the
 Drupal core upgrade to jQuery 3. For Drupal 7, it is fixed in the current
 release (Drupal 7.57) for jQuery 1.4.4 (the version that ships with Drupal
 7 core) as well as for other newer versions of jQuery that might be used on
 the site, for example using the jQuery Update module.
