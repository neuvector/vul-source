Description:
 A flaw was found in Libtiff. This vulnerability is a "write-what-where"
 condition, triggered when the library processes a specially crafted TIFF
 image file.
 
 By providing an abnormally large image height value in the file's metadata,
 an attacker can trick the library into writing attacker-controlled color
 data to an arbitrary memory location. This memory corruption can be
 exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) or to achieve
 arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user.
