Description:
 OpenNebula Community Edition (CE) before 7.0.0 and Enterprise Edition (EE)
 before 6.10.3 have a critical FireEdge race condition that can lead to full
 account takeover. By exploiting this, an unauthenticated attacker can
 obtain a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) belonging to a legitimate user without
 knowledge of their credentials.
