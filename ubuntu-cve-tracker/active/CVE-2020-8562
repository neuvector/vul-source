Description:
 As mitigations to a report from 2019 and CVE-2020-8555, Kubernetes attempts
 to prevent proxied connections from accessing link-local or localhost
 networks when making user-driven connections to Services, Pods, Nodes, or
 StorageClass service providers. As part of this mitigation Kubernetes does
 a DNS name resolution check and validates that response IPs are not in the
 link-local (169.254.0.0/16) or localhost (127.0.0.0/8) range. Kubernetes
 then performs a second DNS resolution without validation for the actual
 connection. If a non-standard DNS server returns different non-cached
 responses, a user may be able to bypass the proxy IP restriction and access
 private networks on the control plane.
