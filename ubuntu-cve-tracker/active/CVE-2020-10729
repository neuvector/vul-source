Description:
 A flaw was found in the use of insufficiently random values in Ansible. Two
 random password lookups of the same length generate the equal value as the
 template caching action for the same file since no re-evaluation happens.
 The highest threat from this vulnerability would be that all passwords are
 exposed at once for the file. This flaw affects Ansible Engine versions
 before 2.9.6.
