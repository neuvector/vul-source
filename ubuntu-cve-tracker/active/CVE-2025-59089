Description:
 If an attacker causes kdcproxy to connect to an attacker-controlled KDC
 server (e.g. through server-side request forgery), they can exploit the
 fact that kdcproxy does not enforce bounds on TCP response length to
 conduct a denial-of-service attack. While receiving the KDC's response,
 kdcproxy copies the entire buffered stream into a new
 buffer on each recv() call, even when the transfer is incomplete, causing
 excessive memory allocation and CPU usage. Additionally, kdcproxy accepts
 incoming response chunks as long as the received data length is not exactly
 equal to the length indicated in the response
 header, even when individual chunks or the total buffer exceed the maximum
 length of a Kerberos message. This allows an attacker to send unbounded
 data until the connection timeout is reached (approximately 12 seconds),
 exhausting server memory or CPU resources. Multiple concurrent requests can
 cause accept queue overflow, denying service to legitimate clients.
