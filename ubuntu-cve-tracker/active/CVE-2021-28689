Description:
 x86: Speculative vulnerabilities with bare (non-shim) 32-bit PV guests
 32-bit x86 PV guest kernels run in ring 1. At the time when Xen was
 developed, this area of the i386 architecture was rarely used, which is why
 Xen was able to use it to implement paravirtualisation, Xen's novel
 approach to virtualization. In AMD64, Xen had to use a different
 implementation approach, so Xen does not use ring 1 to support 64-bit
 guests. With the focus now being on 64-bit systems, and the availability of
 explicit hardware support for virtualization, fixing speculation issues in
 ring 1 is not a priority for processor companies. Indirect Branch
 Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is an architectural x86 extension put
 together to combat speculative execution sidechannel attacks, including
 Spectre v2. It was retrofitted in microcode to existing CPUs. For more
 details on Spectre v2, see: http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html
 However, IBRS does not architecturally protect ring 0 from predictions
 learnt in ring 1. For more details, see:
 https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/deep-dives/deep-dive-indirect-branch-restricted-speculation
 Similar situations may exist with other mitigations for other kinds of
 speculative execution attacks. The situation is quite likely to be similar
 for speculative execution attacks which have yet to be discovered,
 disclosed, or mitigated.
