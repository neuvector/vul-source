Description:
 wolfSSL prior to 5.6.6 did not check that messages in one (D)TLS record do
 not span key boundaries. As a result, it was possible to combine (D)TLS
 messages using different keys into one (D)TLS record. The most extreme edge
 case is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3
 record from the server containing first a ServerHello message and then the
 rest of the first server flight would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In
 (D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL
 client would accept an unencrypted flight from the server. This does not
 compromise key negotiation and authentication so it is assigned a low
 severity rating.
