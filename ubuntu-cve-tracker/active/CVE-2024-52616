Description:
 A flaw was found in the Avahi-daemon, where it initializes DNS transaction
 IDs randomly only once at startup, incrementing them sequentially after
 that. This predictable behavior facilitates DNS spoofing attacks, allowing
 attackers to guess transaction IDs.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> Avahi upstream hasn't fixed this issue, but they now disable
 mdeslaur> wide-area by default: https://github.com/avahi/avahi/pull/577
 mdeslaur> Another bug exists to track improving wide-area:
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/avahi/avahi/issues/578
Mitigation:
 This issue can be mitigated by disabling wide-area DNS queries. This can
 be done by setting enable-wide-are=no in /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf
