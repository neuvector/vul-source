Description:
 guix-daemon in GNU Guix before 5ab3c4c allows privilege escalation because
 build outputs are accessible by local users before file metadata concerns
 (e.g., for setuid and setgid programs) are properly addressed. The
 vulnerability can be remediated within the product via certain pull,
 reconfigure, and restart actions. Both 5ab3c4c and 5582241 are needed to
 resolve the vulnerability.
