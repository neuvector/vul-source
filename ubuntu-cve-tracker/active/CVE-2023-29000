Description:
 The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud
 Server. Starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 3.7.0, by trusting
 that the server will return a certificate that belongs to the keypair of
 the user, a malicious server could get the desktop client to encrypt files
 with a key known to the attacker. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop
 3.7.0. No known workarounds are available.
