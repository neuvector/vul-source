Description:
 Flask is a web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework.
 In Flask 3.1.0, the way fallback key configuration was handled resulted in
 the last fallback key being used for signing, rather than the current
 signing key. Signing is provided by the `itsdangerous` library. A list of
 keys can be passed, and it expects the last (top) key in the list to be the
 most recent key, and uses that for signing. Flask was incorrectly
 constructing that list in reverse, passing the signing key first. Sites
 that have opted-in to use key rotation by setting `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`
 care likely to unexpectedly be signing their sessions with stale keys, and
 their transition to fresher keys will be impeded. Sessions are still
 signed, so this would not cause any sort of data integrity loss. Version
 3.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.
