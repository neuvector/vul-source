Description:
 A flaw was found in rsync. When using the `--safe-links` option, rsync
 fails to properly verify if a symbolic link destination contains another
 symbolic link within it. This results in a path traversal vulnerability,
 which may lead to arbitrary file write outside the desired directory.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Affected function unsafe_symlink() is in rsync in all Ubuntu
  releases so assuming all are affected since this function hasn't changed
  upstream in the last 16 years
