Description:
 In quickjs, in js_print_object, when printing an array, the function first
 fetches the array length and then loops over it. The issue is, printing a
 value is not side-effect free. An attacker-defined callback could run
 during js_print_value, during which the array could get resized and
 len1 become out of bounds. This results in a use-after-free.A second
 instance occurs in the same function during printing of a map or set
 objects. The code iterates over ms->records list, but once again, elements
 could be removed from the list during js_print_value call.
