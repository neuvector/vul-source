Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to
 versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, working with large buffers in Lua scripts can
 lead to a stack overflow. Users of Lua rules and output scripts may be
 affected when working with large buffers. This includes a rule passing a
 large buffer to a Lua script. This issue has been patched in versions
 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves disabling Lua rules
 and output scripts, or making sure limits, such as stream.depth.reassembly
 and HTTP response body limits (response-body-limit), are set to less than
 half the stack size.
