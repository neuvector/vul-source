Description:
 Apache Commons Configuration performs variable interpolation, allowing
 properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format
 for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used to locate an
 instance of org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol.Lookup that performs
 the interpolation. Starting with version 2.4 and continuing through 2.7,
 the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could
 result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These
 lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script
 execution engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url" -
 load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using the
 interpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote
 code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted
 configuration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache
 Commons Configuration 2.8.0, which disables the problematic interpolators
 by default.
