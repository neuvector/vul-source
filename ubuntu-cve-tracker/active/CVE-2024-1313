Description:
 It is possible for a user in a different organization from the owner of a
 snapshot to bypass authorization and delete a snapshot by issuing a DELETE
 request to /api/snapshots/<key> using its view key. This functionality is
 intended to only be available to individuals with the permission to
 write/edit to the snapshot in question, but due to a bug in the
 authorization logic, deletion requests issued by an unprivileged user in a
 different organization than the snapshot owner are treated as authorized.
