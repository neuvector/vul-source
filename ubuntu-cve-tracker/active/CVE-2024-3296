Description:
 A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the rust-openssl package, which
 could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
 Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker
 would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages for
 decryption. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption
 padding mode.
