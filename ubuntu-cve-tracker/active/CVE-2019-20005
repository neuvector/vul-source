Description:
 An issue was discovered in ezXML 0.8.3 through 0.8.6. The function
 ezxml_decode, while parsing a crafted XML file, performs incorrect memory
 handling, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read while running strchr()
 starting with a pointer after a '\0' character (where the processing of a
 string was finished).
