Description:
 The package git before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection via git
 argument injection. When calling the fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {})
 function, the remote parameter is passed to the git fetch subcommand in a
 way that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to
 perform a command injection.
