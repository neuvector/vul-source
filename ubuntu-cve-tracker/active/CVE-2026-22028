Description:
 Preact, a lightweight web development framework, JSON serialization
 protection to prevent Virtual DOM elements from being constructed from
 arbitrary JSON. A regression introduced in Preact 10.26.5 caused this
 protection to be softened. In applications where values from JSON payloads
 are assumed to be strings and passed unmodified to Preact as children, a
 specially-crafted JSON payload could be constructed that would be
 incorrectly treated as a valid VNode. When this chain of failures occurs it
 can result in HTML injection, which can allow arbitrary script execution if
 not mitigated by CSP or other means. Applications using affected Preact
 versions are vulnerable if they meet all of the following conditions:
 first, pass unmodified, unsanitized values from user-modifiable data
 sources (APIs, databases, local storage, etc.) directly into the render
 tree; second assume these values are strings but the data source could
 return actual JavaScript objects instead of JSON strings; and third, the
 data source either fails to perform type sanitization AND blindly
 stores/returns raw objects interchangeably with strings, OR is compromised
 (e.g., poisoned local storage, filesystem, or database). Versions 10.26.10,
 10.27.3, and 10.28.2 patch the issue. The patch versions restore the
 previous strict equality checks that prevent JSON-parsed objects from being
 treated as valid VNodes. Other mitigations are available for those who
 cannot immediately upgrade. Validate input types, cast or validate network
 data, sanitize external data, and use Content Security Policy (CSP).
