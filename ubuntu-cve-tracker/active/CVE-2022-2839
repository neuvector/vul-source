Description:
 The Zephyr Project Manager WordPress plugin before 3.2.55 does not have any
 authorisation as well as CSRF in all its AJAX actions, allowing
 unauthenticated users to call them either directly or via CSRF attacks.
 Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could also
 allow them to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in
 admins.
