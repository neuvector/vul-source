Description:
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI
 specification. Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2,
 and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2, due to insufficient checks when
 bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an
 attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be
 made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to.
 This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133,
 except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target
 (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured
 for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after
 `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly --
 however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the
 host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy
 of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively).
 This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.
