Description:
 'sanitize-html' prior to version 1.0.3 is vulnerable to Cross-site
 Scripting (XSS). The function 'naughtyHref' doesn't properly validate the
 hyperreference (`href`) attribute in anchor tags (`<a>`), allowing bypasses
 that contain different casings, whitespace characters, or hexadecimal
 encodings.
