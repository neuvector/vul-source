Description:
 The vulnerability is that IDToken verifier does not verify if token is
 properly signed. Signature verification makes sure that the token's payload
 comes from valid provider, not from someone else. An attacker can provide a
 compromised token with custom payload. The token will pass the validation
 on the client side. We recommend upgrading to version 1.33.3 or above
