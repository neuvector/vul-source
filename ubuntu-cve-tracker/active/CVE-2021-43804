Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
 STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message
 contains a reason's length, this declared length is not checked against the
 actual received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read
 access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP. A malicious
 actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason length. Users are
 advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.
