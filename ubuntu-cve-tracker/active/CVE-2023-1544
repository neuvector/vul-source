Description:
 A flaw was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's paravirtual RDMA
 device. This flaw allows a crafted guest driver to allocate and initialize
 a huge number of page tables to be used as a ring of descriptors for CQ and
 async events, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read and crash of
 QEMU.
