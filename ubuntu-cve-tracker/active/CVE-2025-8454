Description:
 It was discovered that uscan, a tool to scan/watch upstream sources for new
 releases of software, included in devscripts (a collection of scripts to
 make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier), skips OpenPGP
 verification if the upstream source is already downloaded from a previous
 run even if the verification failed back then.
