Description:
 When receiving an HTML email that contained an <code>iframe</code> element,
 which used a <code>srcdoc</code> attribute to define the inner HTML
 document, remote objects specified in the nested document, for example
 images or videos, were not blocked. Rather, the network was accessed, the
 objects were loaded and displayed. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.
