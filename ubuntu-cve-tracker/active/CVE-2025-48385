Description:
 When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle
 advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to
 offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not
 perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which
 allows the remote side to perform protocol injection.
 This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched
 bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched
 content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst
 case lead to arbitrary code execution.
