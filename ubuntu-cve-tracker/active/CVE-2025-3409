Description:
 A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Nothings stb up to
 f056911. This affects the function stb_include_string. The manipulation of
 the argument path_to_includes leads to stack-based buffer overflow. It is
 possible to initiate the attack remotely. This product does not use
 versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases
 are unavailable. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but
 did not respond in any way.
