Description:
 An issue was discovered in Icinga2 before v2.12.0-rc1. The prepare-dirs
 script (run as part of the icinga2 systemd service) executes chmod 2750
 /run/icinga2/cmd. /run/icinga2 is under control of an unprivileged user by
 default. If /run/icinga2/cmd is a symlink, then it will by followed and
 arbitrary files can be changed to mode 2750 by the unprivileged icinga2
 user.
