Description:
 Rclone is a command-line program to sync files and directories to and from
 different cloud storage providers. Insecure handling of symlinks with
 --links and --metadata in rclone while copying to local disk allows
 unprivileged users to indirectly modify ownership and permissions on
 symlink target files when a superuser or privileged process performs a
 copy. This vulnerability could enable privilege escalation and unauthorized
 access to critical system files, compromising system integrity,
 confidentiality, and availability. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.68.2.
