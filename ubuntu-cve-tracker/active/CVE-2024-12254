Description:
 Starting in Python 3.12.0, the
 asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()
  method would not "pause" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain
 the buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the "high-water
 mark". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write
  buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.
 
 
 
 
 
 This
  vulnerability likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using
  Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module
 with protocols, and using .writelines() method which had new
 zero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of
 these factors are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.
