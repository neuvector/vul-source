Description:
 NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit SDK contains a stack-based buffer overflow
 vulnerability in cuobjdump, where an unprivileged remote attacker could
 exploit this buffer overflow condition by persuading a local user to
 download a specially crafted corrupted file and execute cuobjdump against
 it locally, which may lead to a limited denial of service and some loss of
 data integrity for the local user.
