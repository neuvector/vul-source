 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7570-1
Description:
 There is an issue in CPython when using `bytes.decode("unicode_escape",
 error="ignore|replace")`. If you are not using the "unicode_escape"
 encoding or an error handler your usage is not affected. To work-around
 this issue you may stop using the error= handler and instead wrap the
 bytes.decode() call in a try-except catching the DecodeError.
