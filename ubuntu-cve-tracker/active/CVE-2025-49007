Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Starting in version 3.1.0 and
 prior to version 3.1.16, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the
 Content-Disposition parsing component of Rack. This is very similar to the
 previous security issue CVE-2022-44571. Carefully crafted input can cause
 Content-Disposition header parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of
 time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header
 is used typically used in multipart parsing. Any applications that parse
 multipart posts using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted.
 Version 3.1.16 contains a patch for the vulnerability.
