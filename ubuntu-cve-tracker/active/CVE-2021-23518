Description:
 The package cached-path-relative before 1.1.0 are vulnerable to Prototype
 Pollution via the cache variable that is set as {} instead of
 Object.create(null) in the cachedPathRelative function, which allows access
 to the parent prototype properties when the object is used to create the
 cached relative path. When using the origin path as __proto__, the
 attribute of the object is accessed instead of a path. **Note:** This
 vulnerability derives from an incomplete fix in
 https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CACHEDPATHRELATIVE-72573
