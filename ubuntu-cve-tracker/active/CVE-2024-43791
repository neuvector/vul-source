Description:
 RequestStore provides per-request global storage for Rack. The files
 published as part of request_store 1.3.2 have 0666 permissions, meaning
 that they are world-writable, which allows local users to execute arbitrary
 code. This version was published in 2017, and most production environments
 do not allow access for local users, so the chances of this being exploited
 are very low, given that the vast majority of users will have upgraded, and
 those that have not, if any, are not likely to be exposed.
