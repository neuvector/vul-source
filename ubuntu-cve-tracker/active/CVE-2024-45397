 https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/http3_directives.html
Description:
 h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. When an
 HTTP request using TLS/1.3 early data on top of TCP Fast Open or QUIC 0-RTT
 packets is received and the IP-address-based access control is used, the
 access control does not detect and prohibit HTTP requests conveyed by
 packets with a spoofed source address. This behavior allows attackers on
 the network to execute HTTP requests from addresses that are otherwise
 rejected by the address-based access control. The vulnerability has been
 addressed in commit 15ed15a. Users may disable the use of TCP FastOpen and
 QUIC to mitigate the issue.
