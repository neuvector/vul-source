Description:
 A flaw was found in IPA, all 4.6.x versions before 4.6.7, all 4.7.x
 versions before 4.7.4 and all 4.8.x versions before 4.8.3, in the way the
 internal function ber_scanf() was used in some components of the IPA
 server, which parsed kerberos key data. An unauthenticated attacker who
 could trigger parsing of the krb principal key could cause the IPA server
 to crash or in some conditions, cause arbitrary code to be executed on the
 server hosting the IPA server.
