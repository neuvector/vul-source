Description:
 The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and
 REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter notebook,
 JupyterLab, and Voila. In Jupyter Server before version 1.1.1, an open
 redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server to redirect the
 browser to a different malicious website. All jupyter servers running
 without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these
 maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter
 server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but
 ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same
 vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8. This is fixed in
 jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to
 run your server on a url prefix: "jupyter server
 --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/".
