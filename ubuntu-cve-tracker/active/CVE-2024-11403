Description:
 There exists an out of bounds read/write in LibJXL versions prior to
 commit 9cc451b91b74ba470fd72bd48c121e9f33d24c99. The JPEG decoder used by
 the JPEG XL encoder when doing JPEG recompression (i.e. if using
 JxlEncoderAddJPEGFrame on untrusted input) does not properly check bounds
 in the presence of incomplete codes. This could lead to an out-of-bounds
 write. In jpegli which is released as part of the same project, the same
 vulnerability is present. However, the relevant buffer is part of a bigger
 structure, and the code makes no assumptions on the values that could be
 overwritten. The issue could however cause jpegli to read uninitialised
 memory, or addresses of functions.
