Description:
 A vulnerability was found in the libsoup package. This flaw stems from its
 failure to correctly verify the termination of multipart HTTP messages.
 This can allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted multipart HTTP
 body, causing the libsoup-consuming server to read beyond its allocated
 memory boundaries (out-of-bounds read).
