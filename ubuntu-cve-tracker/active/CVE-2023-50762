Description:
 When processing a PGP/MIME payload that contains digitally signed text, the
 first paragraph of the text was never shown to the user. This is because
 the text was interpreted as a MIME message and the first paragraph was
 always treated as an email header section. A digitally signed text from a
 different context, such as a signed GIT commit, could be used to spoof an
 email message. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 115.6.
