Description:
 Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0.
 
 The FileObject API in Commons VFS has a 'resolveFile' method that
 takes a 'scope' parameter. Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that
 "an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of
 the base file". However, when the path contains encoded ".."
 characters (for example, "%2E%2E/bar.txt"), it might return file objects
 that are not
 a descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.
 This issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.
