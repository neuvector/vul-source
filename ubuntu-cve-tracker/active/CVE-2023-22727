Description:
 CakePHP is a development framework for PHP web apps. In affected versions
 the `Cake\Database\Query::limit()` and `Cake\Database\Query::offset()`
 methods are vulnerable to SQL injection if passed un-sanitized user request
 data. This issue has been fixed in 4.2.12, 4.3.11, 4.4.10. Users are
 advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by
 using CakePHP's Pagination library. Manually validating or casting
 parameters to these methods will also mitigate the issue.
