Description:
 SSH servers which implement file transfer protocols are vulnerable to a
 denial of service attack from clients which complete the key exchange
 slowly, or not at all, causing pending content to be read into memory, but
 never transmitted.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> snapd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto
 jdstrand> lxd in 18.04 LTS and earlier contains an embedded copy of
 jdstrand> golang-go.crypto
 hlibk> snapd and lxd only use the terminal sub-package, not the ssh part of
  golang-go.crypto, so they are not vulnerable
