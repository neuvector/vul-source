 https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/7487cf7eb14be2f65a1eb108e8629c07ef45e0a1
 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4813-1
Description:
 An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind prior to 2.7.9.4,
 2.8.11.2, and 2.9.6. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for
 a specific property), the service has the Oracle JDBC jar in the classpath,
 and an attacker can provide an LDAP service to access, it is possible to
 make the service execute a malicious payload.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled 
 deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
 arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.
