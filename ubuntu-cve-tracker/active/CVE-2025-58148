Description:
 [This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the
 text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
 
 Some Viridian hypercalls can specify a mask of vCPU IDs as an input, in
 one of three formats.  Xen has boundary checking bugs with all three
 formats, which can cause out-of-bounds reads and writes while processing
 the inputs.
 
  * CVE-2025-58147.  Hypercalls using the HV_VP_SET Sparse format can
    cause vpmask_set() to write out of bounds when converting the bitmap
    to Xen's format.
 
  * CVE-2025-58148.  Hypercalls using any input format can cause
    send_ipi() to read d->vcpu[] out-of-bounds, and operate on a wild
    vCPU pointer.
