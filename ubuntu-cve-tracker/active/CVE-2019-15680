Description:
 TightVNC code version 1.3.10 contains null pointer dereference in
 HandleZlibBPP function, which results Denial of System (DoS). This attack
 appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Pavel Cheremushkin discovered that TightVNC has a null pointer dereference
 vulnerability. An attacker could use it to cause a Denial of Service or
 possible a remote code execution.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> per upstream, this is a non-issue in libvncserver as checks are
 mdeslaur> already done in zlib, see:
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/issues/359#issuecomment-599133529
 mdeslaur> for completeness, the fix was added to focal and earlier
 mdeslaur> releases, but will not be added to groovy+
