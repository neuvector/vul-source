Description:
 Cobbler, a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network
 installation environments, has an improper authentication vulnerability
 starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7.
 `utils.get_shared_secret()` always returns `-1`, which allows anyone to
 connect to cobbler XML-RPC as user `''` password `-1` and make any changes.
 This gives anyone with network access to a cobbler server full control of
 the server. Versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7 fix the issue.
