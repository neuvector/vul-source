Description:
 Previously Firefox for macOS and Linux would download temporary files to a
 user-specific directory in <code>/tmp</code>, but this behavior was changed
 to download them to <code>/tmp</code> where they could be affected by other
 local users. This behavior was reverted to the original, user-specific
 directory. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox for macOS and Linux. Other
 operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR
 < 91.7 and Thunderbird < 91.7.
