Description:
 OpenRefine is a free, open source power tool for working with messy data
 and improving it. A jdbc attack vulnerability exists in
 OpenRefine(version<=3.7.7) where an attacker may construct a JDBC query
 which may read files on the host filesystem. Due to the newer MySQL driver
 library in the latest version of OpenRefine (8.0.30), there is no
 associated deserialization utilization point, so original code execution
 cannot be achieved, but attackers can use this vulnerability to read
 sensitive files on the target server. This issue has been addressed in
 version 3.7.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
 for this vulnerability.
