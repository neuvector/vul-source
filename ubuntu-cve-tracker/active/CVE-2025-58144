Description:
 [This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the
 text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
 
 There are two issues related to the mapping of pages belonging to other
 domains: For one, an assertion is wrong there, where the case actually
 needs handling.  A NULL pointer de-reference could result on a release
 build.  This is CVE-2025-58144.
 
 And then the P2M lock isn't held until a page reference was actually
 obtained (or the attempt to do so has failed).  Otherwise the page can
 not only change type, but even ownership in between, thus allowing
 domain boundaries to be violated.  This is CVE-2025-58145.
