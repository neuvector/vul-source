Description:
 The Salt-SSH pre-flight option copies the script to the target at a
 predictable path, which allows an attacker to force Salt-SSH to run their
 script. If an attacker has access to the target VM and knows the path to
 the pre-flight script before it runs they can ensure Salt-SSH runs their
 script with the privileges of the user running Salt-SSH.Â Do not make the
 copy path on the target predictable and ensure we check return codes of the
 scp command if the copy fails.
