Description:
 Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a
 long time. Impact summary: Applications that use the function
 EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long
 delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an
 untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. When function
 EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is done
 to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is
 a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes
 quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computation
 would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check()
 and supplies an RSA key obtained from an untrusted source could be
 vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
 EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however
 it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For that
 reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the '-pubin' and
 '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is
 not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are
 affected by this issue.
