Description:
 Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to
 be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for
 interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used to locate an
 instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the
 interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the
 set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in
 arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are:
 - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine
 (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url" - load values from
 urls, including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation
 defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code
 execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted
 configuration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache
 Commons Text 1.10.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by
 default.
