Description:
 Finit is a fast init for Linux systems. Versions starting from 3.0-rc1 and
 prior to version 4.11 bundle an implementation of getty for the `tty`
 configuration directive that can bypass `/bin/login`, i.e., a user can log
 in as any user without authentication. This issue has been patched in
 version 4.11.
