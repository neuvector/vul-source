Description:
 By crafting a malformed file name for an attachment in a multipart message,
 an attacker can trick Thunderbird into including a directory listing of
 /tmp when the message is forwarded or edited as a new message. This
 vulnerability could allow attackers to disclose sensitive information from
 the victim's system. This vulnerability is not limited to Linux; similar
 behavior has been observed on Windows as well. This vulnerability affects
 Thunderbird < 137.0.2 and Thunderbird < 128.9.2.
