Description:
 golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Starting in version
 3.2.0 and prior to versions 5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function
 parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument
 (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a
 malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer  followed
 by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to
 the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's
 argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2
 and 4.5.2.
