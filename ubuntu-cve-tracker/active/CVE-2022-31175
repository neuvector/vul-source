Description:
 CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich text editor. A cross-site scripting
 vulnerability has been discovered affecting three optional CKEditor 5's
 packages in versions prior to 35.0.1. The vulnerability allowed to trigger
 a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions. The affected
 packages are `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm`,
 `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support`, and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-embed`.
 The specific conditions are 1) Using one of the affected packages. In case
 of `ckeditor5-html-support` and `ckeditor5-html-embed`, additionally, it
 was required to use a configuration that allows unsafe markup inside the
 editor. 2) Destroying the editor instance and 3) Initializing the editor on
 an element and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base. The root
 cause of the issue was a mechanism responsible for updating the source
 element with the markup coming from the CKEditor 5 data pipeline after
 destroying the editor. This vulnerability might affect a small percent of
 integrators that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy and use
 Markdown, General HTML Support or HTML embed features. The problem has been
 recognized and patched. The fix is available in version 35.0.1. There are
 no known workarounds for this issue.
