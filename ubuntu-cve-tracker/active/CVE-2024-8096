Description:
 When curl is told to use the Certificate Status Request TLS extension,
 often referred to as OCSP stapling, to verify that the server certificate
 is valid, it might fail to detect some OCSP problems and instead wrongly
 consider the response as fine.  If the returned status reports another
 error than 'revoked' (like for example 'unauthorized') it is not treated as
 a bad certficate.
