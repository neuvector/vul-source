Description:
 The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support
 encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool
 for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt
 function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used
 is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from
 running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system.
 In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a
 ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the
 first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was
 tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not
 be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable
 layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure
 would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this
 verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the
 ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had
 previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4.
 Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.
