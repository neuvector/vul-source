Description:
 Galette is a membership management web application for non profit
 organizations. Starting in version 0.9.6 and prior to version 1.2.0,
 attackers with group manager role can bypass intended restrictions allowing
 unauthorized access and changes despite role-based controls. Since it
 requires privileged access initially, exploitation is restricted to
 malicious insiders or compromised group managers accounts. Version 1.2.0
 fixes the issue.
