Description:
 An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 19.x and Certified Asterisk
 through 16.8-cert13. The func_odbc module provides possibly inadequate
 escaping functionality for backslash characters in SQL queries, resulting
 in user-provided data creating a broken SQL query or possibly a SQL
 injection. This is fixed in 16.25.2, 18.11.2, and 19.3.2, and 16.8-cert14.
