Description:
 Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
 reusable PHP components. The Symfony HTTP cache system, acts as a reverse
 proxy: It caches entire responses (including headers) and returns them to
 the clients. In a recent change in the `AbstractSessionListener`, the
 response might contain a `Set-Cookie` header. If the Symfony HTTP cache
 system is enabled, this response might bill stored and return to the next
 clients. An attacker can use this vulnerability to retrieve the victim's
 session. This issue has been patched and is available for branch 4.4.
