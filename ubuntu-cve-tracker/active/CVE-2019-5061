Description:
 An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the hostapd 2.6,
 where an attacker could trigger AP to send IAPP location updates for
 stations, before the required authentication process has completed. This
 could lead to different denial of service scenarios, either by causing CAM
 table attacks, or by leading to traffic flapping if faking already existing
 clients in other nearby Aps of the same wireless infrastructure. An
 attacker can forge Authentication and Association Request packets to
 trigger this vulnerability.
