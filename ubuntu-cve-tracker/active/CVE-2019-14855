Description:
 A flaw was found in the way certificate signatures could be forged using
 collisions found in the SHA-1 algorithm. An attacker could use this
 weakness to create forged certificate signatures. This issue affects GnuPG
 versions before 2.2.18.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> in master, gnupg disables SHA-1 signatures completely. In the
 mdeslaur> 2.2 branch, it disables SHA-1 signatures after a certain date
 mdeslaur> only.
 rodrigo-zaiden> As of 2022-03-22 there is no upstream patch available
 rodrigo-zaiden> for gnupg 1.4 series. Backporting from 2.2 would be
 rodrigo-zaiden> too risky.
