Description:
 The KDE Connect verification-code protocol before 2025-04-18 uses only 8
 characters and therefore allows brute-force attacks. This affects KDE
 Connect before 1.33.0 on Android, KDE Connect before 25.04 on desktop, KDE
 Connect before 0.5 on iOS, Valent before 1.0.0.alpha.47, and GSConnect
 before 59.
