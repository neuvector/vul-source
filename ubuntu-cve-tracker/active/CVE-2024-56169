Description:
 A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before
 2.0.0. RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain a
 backup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as a fallback in
 case a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files. However, the product
 currently uses its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool (because
 fetching is performed through deltas). If a fetch fails midway or yields
 incorrect files, there is no viable fallback. This leads to incomplete
 route origin validation data.
