Description:
 In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check
 that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field,
 allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an
 out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows
 context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory
 disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature)
 public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte
 type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type
 indicator before validating the size of its input.
