Description:
 Git, a revision control system, is vulnerable to path traversal prior to
 versions 2.39.2, 2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6,
 2.31.7, and 2.30.8. By feeding a crafted input to `git apply`, a path
 outside the working tree can be overwritten as the user who is running `git
 apply`. A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2, v2.38.4,
 v2.37.6, v2.36.5, v2.35.7, v2.34.7, v2.33.7, v2.32.6, v2.31.7, and v2.30.8.
 As a workaround, use `git apply --stat` to inspect a patch before applying;
 avoid applying one that creates a symbolic link and then creates a file
 beyond the symbolic link.
