Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.9 and 3.x before 3.6.1, in
 which the user-selected algorithm is not used. Unlike previously
 documented, enabling MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE does not cause the PSA
 subsystem to use HMAC_DRBG: it uses HMAC_DRBG only when
 MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG and MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C are disabled.
