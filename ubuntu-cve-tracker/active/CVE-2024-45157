Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.9 and 3.x before 3.6.1, in
 which the user-selected algorithm is not used. Unlike previously
 documented, enabling MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE does not cause the PSA
 subsystem to use HMAC_DRBG: it uses HMAC_DRBG only when
 MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG and MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C are disabled.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 hlibk> Affects versions since 2.26.0 until 2.28.9 and 3.6.1.
 hlibk> Upstream developers have decided to accept the behavior and instead
  opted for fixing the documentation. As the fix only addresses the
  documentation, the priority has been lowered. The CVE description contains
  the relevant information to consider.
