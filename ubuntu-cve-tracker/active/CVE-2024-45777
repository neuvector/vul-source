Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2. The calculation of the translation buffer when
 reading a language .mo file in grub_gettext_getstr_from_position() may
 overflow, leading to a Out-of-bound write. This issue can be leveraged by
 an attacker to overwrite grub2's sensitive heap data, eventually leading to
 the circumvention of secure boot protections.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
