Description:
 GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in
 lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a '\0' byte is encountered. NOTE:
 there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the
 observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific
 compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may
 occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated
 by Bison.
