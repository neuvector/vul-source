Description:
 Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework.
 The`consolenewsection` parameter is not properly sanitized when saving
 external links in links.php . Morever, the said consolenewsection parameter
 is stored in the database and reflected back to user in `index.php`,
 finally leading to stored XSS. Users with the privilege to create external
 links can manipulate the “consolenewsection” parameter in the http post
 request while creating external links to perform stored XSS attacks. The
 vulnerability known as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) occurs when an
 application allows untrusted user input to be displayed on a web page
 without proper validation or escaping. This issue has been addressed in
 release version 1.2.28. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this vulnerability.
