Description:
 stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis
 files. A crafted file may trigger out of bounds write in `f->vendor[len] =
 (char)'\0';`. The root cause is that if the len read in `start_decoder` is
 `-1` and `len + 1` becomes 0 when passed to `setup_malloc`. The
 `setup_malloc` behaves differently when `f->alloc.alloc_buffer` is
 pre-allocated. Instead of returning `NULL` as in `malloc` case it shifts
 the pre-allocated buffer by zero and returns the currently available memory
 block. This issue may lead to code execution.
