Description:
 A flaw was found in the SPICE file transfer protocol. File data from the
 host system can end up in full or in parts in the client connection of an
 illegitimate local user in the VM system. Active file transfers from other
 users could also be interrupted, resulting in a denial of service. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality as well
 as system availability. This flaw affects spice-vdagent versions 0.20 and
 prior.
