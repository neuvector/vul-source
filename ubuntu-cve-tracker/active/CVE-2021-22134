Description:
 A document disclosure flaw was found in Elasticsearch versions after 7.6.0
 and before 7.11.0 when Document or Field Level Security is used. Get
 requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query
 against a recently updated document. This affects documents that have been
 updated and not yet refreshed in the index. This could result in the search
 disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be
 able to view.
