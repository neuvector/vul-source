Description:
 Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP
 packet can lead to an integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets()
 function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the total_len
 value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which will be
 used in memory allocation. If the attack succeeds in such way, subsequent
 operations can write past the end of the buffer.
