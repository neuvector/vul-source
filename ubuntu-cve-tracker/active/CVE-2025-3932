Description:
 It was possible to craft an email that showed a tracking link as an
 attachment. If the user attempted to open the attachment, Thunderbird
 automatically accessed the link. The configuration to block remote content
 did not prevent that. Thunderbird has been fixed to no longer allow access
 to web pages listed in the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header of an
 email. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 128.10.1 and Thunderbird <
 138.0.1.
