Description:
 Mod_gnutls is a TLS module for Apache HTTPD based on GnuTLS. Versions from
 0.9.0 to 0.12.0 (including) did not properly fail blocking read operations
 on TLS connections when the transport hit timeouts. Instead it entered an
 endless loop retrying the read operation, consuming CPU resources. This
 could be exploited for denial of service attacks. If trace level logging
 was enabled, it would also produce an excessive amount of log output during
 the loop, consuming disk space. The problem has been fixed in commit
 d7eec4e598158ab6a98bf505354e84352f9715ec, please update to version 0.12.1.
 There are no workarounds, users who cannot update should apply the errno
 fix detailed in the security advisory.
