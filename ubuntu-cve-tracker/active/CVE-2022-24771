Description:
 Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport
 Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5
 signature verification code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm
 structure. This can allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and
 uses unchecked portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature
 when a low public exponent is being used. The issue has been addressed in
 `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
