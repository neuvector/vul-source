Description:
 An issue was discovered in allauth-django before 65.13.0. Both Okta and
 NetIQ were using preferred_username as the identifier for third-party
 provider accounts. That value may be mutable and should therefore be
 avoided for authorization decisions. The providers are now using sub
 instead.
