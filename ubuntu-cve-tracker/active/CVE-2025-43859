 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7503-1
Description:
 h11 is a Python implementation of HTTP/1.1. Prior to version 0.16.0, a
 leniency in h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message
 bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain
 conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.16.0. Since
 exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse)
 proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.
