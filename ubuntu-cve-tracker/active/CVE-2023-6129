Description:
 Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code)
 implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of
 applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides
 vector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether
 the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be
 corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC
 (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs
 restores the contents of vector registers in a different order than they
 are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers are
 corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on
 newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. The
 consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be
 various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend
 on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
 consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the
 application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers
 for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an
 incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash
 leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most
 frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated
 encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this
 AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is
 enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD
 cipher is used. This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can
 be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete
 application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider this
 a Low severity security issue.
