Description:
 Tencent RapidJSON is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to an integer
 overflow in the `GenericReader::ParseNumber()` function of
 `include/rapidjson/reader.h` when parsing JSON text from a stream. An
 attacker needs to send the victim a crafted file which needs to be opened;
 this triggers the integer overflow vulnerability (when the file is parsed),
 leading to elevation of privilege.
