Description:
 Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web
 applications using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages. Prior to
 21.0.2, 20.3.15, and 19.2.17, A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability has been identified in the Angular Template Compiler. It
 occurs because the compiler's internal security schema is incomplete,
 allowing attackers to bypass Angular's built-in security sanitization.
 Specifically, the schema fails to classify certain URL-holding attributes
 (e.g., those that could contain javascript: URLs) as requiring strict URL
 security, enabling the injection of malicious scripts. This vulnerability
 is fixed in 21.0.2, 20.3.15, and 19.2.17.
