Description:
 There exists an vulnerability causing an abort() to be called in gRPC. The
 following headers cause gRPC's C++ implementation to abort() when called
 via http2: te: x (x != trailers) :scheme: x (x != http, https)
 grpclb_client_stats: x (x == anything) On top of sending one of those
 headers, a later header must be sent that gets the total header size past
 8KB. We recommend upgrading past git commit
 2485fa94bd8a723e5c977d55a3ce10b301b437f8 or v1.53 and above.
