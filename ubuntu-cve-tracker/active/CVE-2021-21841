Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4
 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library
 v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input when reading an atom using the
 'sbgp' FOURCC code can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked
 arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory
 corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this
 vulnerability.
