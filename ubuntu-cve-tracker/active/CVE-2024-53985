Description:
 rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails
 applications. There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain
 configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer 1.6.0 when used with Rails >=
 7.1.0 and Nokogiri < 1.15.7, or 1.16.x < 1.16.8. The XSS vulnerability with
 certain configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to
 inject content if HTML5 sanitization is enabled and the application
 developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags with both "math" and
 "style" elements or both both "svg" and "style" elements. This
 vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.1.
