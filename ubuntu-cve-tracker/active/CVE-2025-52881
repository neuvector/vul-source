Description:
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI
 specification. In versions 1.2.7, 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-rc.2, an attacker can
 trick runc into misdirecting writes to /proc to other procfs files through
 the use of a racing container with shared mounts (we have also verified
 this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with docker
 buildx build as that also permits triggering parallel execution of
 containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be
 through symbolic links in a tmpfs or theoretically other methods such as
 regular bind-mounts. While similar, the mitigation applied for the related
 CVE, CVE-2019-19921, was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to
 verify that when LSM labels are written they are actually procfs files.
 This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3, and 1.4.0-rc.3.
