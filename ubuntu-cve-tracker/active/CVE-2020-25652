Description:
 A flaw was found in the spice-vdagentd daemon, where it did not properly
 handle client connections that can be established via the UNIX domain
 socket in `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock`. Any unprivileged local
 guest user could use this flaw to prevent legitimate agents from connecting
 to the spice-vdagentd daemon, resulting in a denial of service. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. This flaw affects
 spice-vdagent versions 0.20 and prior.
