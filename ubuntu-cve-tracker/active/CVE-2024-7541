Description:
 oFono AT CMT Command Uninitialized Variable Information Disclosure
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose
 sensitive information on affected installations of oFono. An attacker must
 first obtain the ability to execute code on the target modem in order to
 exploit this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of responses from AT+CMT
 commands. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of
 memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction
 with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of
 root. Was ZDI-CAN-23308.
