Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7,
 missing initialization of the random seed for "thash" leads to byte-range
 tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to an
 attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe
 performance degradation. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.
