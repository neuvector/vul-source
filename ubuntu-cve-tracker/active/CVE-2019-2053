Description:
 In wnm_parse_neighbor_report_elem of wnm_sta.c, there is a possible
 out-of-bounds read due to missing bounds check. This could lead to local
 information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User
 interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions:
 Android-7.0 Android-7.1.1 Android-7.1.2 Android-8.0 Android-8.1 Android-9
 Android ID: A-122074159
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> per upstream: The actual read bytes would be stored locally,
 mdeslaur> but they were not used for anything, so other than reading
 mdeslaur> beyond the end of an allocated heap memory buffer, this did not
 mdeslaur> result in any behavior difference or exposure of the bytes.
