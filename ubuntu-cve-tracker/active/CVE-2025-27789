Description:
 Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. When using
 versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular
 expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the
 `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific
 replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to
 `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions
 are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups,
 using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named
 capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second
 argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and
 `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual
 users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on
 `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to
 `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new
 enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies
 is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known
 workarounds are available.
