Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library. Prior to
 version 2.16, Opus PLC may zero-fill the input frame as long as the decoder
 ptime, while the input frame length, which is based on stream ptime, may be
 less than that. This issue affects PJSIP users who use the Opus audio codec
 in receiving direction. The vulnerability can lead to unexpected
 application termination due to a memory overwrite. This issue has been
 patched in version 2.16.
