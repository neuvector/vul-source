Description:
 When importing a revoked key that specified key compromise as the
 revocation reason, Thunderbird did not update the existing copy of the key
 that was not yet revoked, and the existing key was kept as non-revoked.
 Revocation statements that used another revocation reason, or that didn't
 specify a revocation reason, were unaffected. This vulnerability affects
 Thunderbird < 91.8.
