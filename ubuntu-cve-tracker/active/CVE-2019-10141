Description:
 A vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector all versions
 excluding 5.0.2, 6.0.3, 7.2.4, 8.0.3 and 8.2.1. A SQL-injection
 vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector's
 node_cache.find_node(). This function makes a SQL query using unfiltered
 data from a server reporting inspection results (by a POST to the
 /v1/continue endpoint). Because the API is unauthenticated, the flaw could
 be exploited by an attacker with access to the network on which
 ironic-inspector is listening. Because of how ironic-inspector uses the
 query results, it is unlikely that data could be obtained. However, the
 attacker could pass malicious data and create a denial of service.
