Description:
 When batch jobs are executed by pgAgent, a script is created in a temporary
 directory and then executed. In versions of pgAgent prior to 4.2.3, an
 insufficiently seeded random number generator is used when generating the
 directory name, leading to the possibility for a local attacker to
 pre-create the directory and thus prevent pgAgent from executing jobs,
 disrupting scheduled tasks.
