Description:
 An issue was discovered in TrouSerS through 0.3.14. If the tcsd daemon is
 started with root privileges, the tss user still has read and write access
 to the /etc/tcsd.conf file (which contains various settings related to this
 daemon).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the Debian/Ubuntu package starts tcsd as the tss user, not as
 mdeslaur> root, so this issue doesn't affect default configurations
