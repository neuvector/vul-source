Description:
 Every `named` instance configured to run as a recursive resolver maintains
 a cache database holding the responses to the queries it has recently sent
 to authoritative servers. The size limit for that cache database can be
 configured using the `max-cache-size` statement in the configuration file;
 it defaults to 90% of the total amount of memory available on the host.
 When the size of the cache reaches 7/8 of the configured limit, a
 cache-cleaning algorithm starts to remove expired and/or least-recently
 used RRsets from the cache, to keep memory use below the configured limit.
 It has been discovered that the effectiveness of the cache-cleaning
 algorithm used in `named` can be severely diminished by querying the
 resolver for specific RRsets in a certain order, effectively allowing the
 configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded. This issue
 affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.16.41, 9.18.0 through 9.18.15,
 9.19.0 through 9.19.13, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1
 through 9.18.15-S1.
