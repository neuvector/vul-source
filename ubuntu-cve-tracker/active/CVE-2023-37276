Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. aiohttp v3.8.4 and earlier are bundled with llhttp v6.0.6.
 Vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when
 available which is the default case when installing from a wheel. This
 vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie
 `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if you
 are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`).
 Sending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of
 the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling. This issue has
 been addressed in version 3.8.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
 to upgrade can reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an
 environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser
 implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable.
