Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. Improper validation makes it possible for an attacker to modify the
 HTTP request (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request
 if the attacker controls the HTTP method. The vulnerability occurs only if
 the attacker can control the HTTP method (GET, POST etc.) of the request.
 If the attacker can control the HTTP version of the request it will be able
 to modify the request (request smuggling). This issue has been patched in
 version 3.9.0.
