Description:
 An issue was discovered in TrouSerS through 0.3.14. If the tcsd daemon is
 started with root privileges, the creation of the system.data file is prone
 to symlink attacks. The tss user can be used to create or corrupt existing
 files, which could possibly lead to a DoS attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the Debian/Ubuntu package starts tcsd as the tss user, not as
 mdeslaur> root, so this issue doesn't affect default configurations
