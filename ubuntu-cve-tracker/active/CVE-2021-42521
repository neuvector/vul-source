Description:
 There is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in VTK before 9.2.5, and
 it lies in IO/Infovis/vtkXMLTreeReader.cxx. The vendor didn't check the
 return value of libxml2 API 'xmlDocGetRootElement', and try to dereference
 it. It is unsafe as the return value can be NULL and that NULL pointer
 dereference may crash the application.
