Description:
 1. A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target`
  2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target`
 (same
    hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set
  3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path
 (`path=\"/\",`).
    Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.
 4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer
    boundary
 
 The bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come
 to
 the wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of
 the
 secure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory
 contents
 immediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.
 
 The presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set
 of
 the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so
 overriding
 it on an insecure host should not be okay.
