Description:
 gpsd before commit dc966aa contains a heap-based out-of-bounds write
 vulnerability in the drivers/driver_nmea2000.c file. The hnd_129540
 function, which handles NMEA2000 PGN 129540 (GNSS Satellites in View)
 packets, fails to validate the user-supplied satellite count against the
 size of the skyview array (184 elements). This allows an attacker to write
 beyond the bounds of the array by providing a satellite count up to 255,
 leading to memory corruption, Denial of Service (DoS), and potentially
 arbitrary code execution.
