Description:
 A race condition vulnerability was found in the way the spice-vdagentd
 daemon handled new client connections. This flaw may allow an unprivileged
 local guest user to become the active agent for spice-vdagentd, possibly
 resulting in a denial of service or information leakage from the host. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality as well
 as system availability. This flaw affects spice-vdagent versions 0.20 and
 prior.
