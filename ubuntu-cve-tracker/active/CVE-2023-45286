Description:
 A race condition in go-resty can result in HTTP request body disclosure
 across requests. This condition can be triggered by calling sync.Pool.Put
 with the same *bytes.Buffer more than once, when request retries are
 enabled and a retry occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a
 bytes.Buffer that hasn't had bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty
 buffer will contain the HTTP request body from an unrelated request, and
 go-resty will append the current HTTP request body to it, sending two
 bodies in one request. The sync.Pool in question is defined at package
 level scope, so a completely unrelated server could receive the request
 body.
