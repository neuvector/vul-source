Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Access rights of Xenstore
 nodes are per domid. Unfortunately, existing granted access rights are not
 removed when a domain is being destroyed. This means that a new domain
 created with the same domid will inherit the access rights to Xenstore
 nodes from the previous domain(s) with the same domid. Because all Xenstore
 entries of a guest below /local/domain/<domid> are being deleted by Xen
 tools when a guest is destroyed, only Xenstore entries of other guests
 still running are affected. For example, a newly created guest domain might
 be able to read sensitive information that had belonged to a previously
 existing guest domain. Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml) are
 vulnerable.
