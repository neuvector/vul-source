Description:
 log.c in Squid Analysis Report Generator (sarg) through 2.3.11 allows local
 privilege escalation. By default, it uses a fixed temporary directory
 /tmp/sarg. As the root user, sarg creates this directory or reuses an
 existing one in an insecure manner. An attacker can pre-create the
 directory, and place symlinks in it (after winning a
 /tmp/sarg/denied.int_unsort race condition). The outcome will be corrupted
 or newly created files in privileged file system locations.
