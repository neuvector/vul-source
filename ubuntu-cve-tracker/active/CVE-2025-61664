Description:
 A vulnerability in the GRUB2 bootloader has been identified in the normal
 module. This flaw, a memory Use After Free issue, occurs because the
 normal_exit command is not properly unregistered when its related module is
 unloaded. An attacker can exploit this condition by invoking the command
 after the module has been removed, causing the system to improperly access
 a previously freed memory location. This leads to a system crash or
 possible impacts in data confidentiality and integrity.

Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
