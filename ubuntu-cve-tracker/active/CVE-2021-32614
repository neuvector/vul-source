Description:
 A flaw was found in dmg2img through 20170502. fill_mishblk() does not check
 the length of the read buffer, and copy 0xCC bytes from it. The length of
 the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than
 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to
 memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a
 chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.
