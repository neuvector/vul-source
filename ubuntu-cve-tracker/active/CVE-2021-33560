Description:
 Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption
 because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against
 mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. This, for
 example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This CVE was originally for the issue that is now CVE=2021-40528
 mdeslaur> but somehow got switched to the exponent blinding issue instead.
 mdeslaur> The fix to add exponent blinding appears to only have been added
 mdeslaur> to 1.9.x but never backported to 1.8.x, contrary to the CVE
 mdeslaur> description
 mdeslaur> The commit below was never backported to 1.8.x because the
 mdeslaur> upstream developers consider this hardening and not a security
 mdeslaur> issue.
