Description:
 OpenSSH server (sshd) 9.1 introduced a double-free vulnerability during
 options.kex_algorithms handling. This is fixed in OpenSSH 9.2. The double
 free can be leveraged, by an unauthenticated remote attacker in the default
 configuration, to jump to any location in the sshd address space. One
 third-party report states "remote code execution is theoretically
 possible."
