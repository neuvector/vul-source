Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The cutmem command
 does not honor secure boot locking allowing an privileged attacker to
 remove address ranges from memory creating an opportunity to circumvent
 SecureBoot protections after proper triage about grub's memory layout. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and
 integrity as well as system availability.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the cutmem command in GRUB 2 did not honor
 secure boot locking. A local attacker could use this to execute
 arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes:
 sbeattie| grub2-unsigned will contain fixes and supersede grub2, which
  will contain only BIOS grub bits.
