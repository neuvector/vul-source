Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In
 versions prior to 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6, Grafana is subject to Improper
 Preservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation on some
 folders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability impacts
 Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards, as the
 migrations which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBAC
 permissions do not account for the scenario where the only user permission
 in the folder is Admin, as a result RBAC adds permissions for Editors and
 Viewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issue
 has been patched in versions 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6. A workaround when
 the impacted folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additional
 permissions manually.
