Description:
 A path traversal vulnerability was found in the CPIO utility. This issue
 could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to trick a user into opening
 a specially crafted archive. During the extraction process, the archiver
 could follow symlinks outside of the intended directory, which allows files
 to be written in arbitrary directories through symlinks.
