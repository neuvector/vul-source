Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to
 versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a stack overflow can occur on large HTTP file
 transfers if the user has increased the HTTP response body limit and
 enabled the logging of printable http bodies. This issue has been patched
 in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves using
 default HTTP response body limits and/or disabling http-body-printable
 logging; body logging is disabled by default.
