Description:
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an expired pointer reference
 bug, Squid prior to version 6.6 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack
 against Cache Manager error responses. This problem allows a trusted client
 to perform Denial of Service when generating error pages for Client Manager
 reports. Squid older than 5.0.5 have not been tested and should be assumed
 to be vulnerable. All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.9 are vulnerable. All
 Squid-6.x up to and including 6.5 are vulnerable. This bug is fixed by
 Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the
 stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. As a workaround,
 prevent access to Cache Manager using Squid's main access control:
 `http_access deny manager`.
