Description:
 ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF bypass
 for path-based payloads submitted via specially crafted request URLs.
 ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded characters present in request URLs
 before it separates the URL path component from the optional query string
 component. This results in an impedance mismatch versus RFC compliant
 back-end applications. The vulnerability hides an attack payload in the
 path component of the URL from WAF rules inspecting it. A back-end may be
 vulnerable if it uses the path component of request URLs to construct
 queries. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.0.12. The
 ModSecurity v2 release line is not affected by this vulnerability.
