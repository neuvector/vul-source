Description:
 When an application tells libcurl it wants to allow HTTP/2 server push, and
 the amount of received headers for the push surpasses the maximum allowed
 limit (1000), libcurl aborts the server push. When aborting, libcurl
 inadvertently does not free all the previously allocated headers and
 instead leaks the memory. Further, this error condition fails silently and
 is therefore not easily detected by an application.
