Description:
 A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript. The vulnerability occurs
 because the serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain
 inputs, such as regex or other JavaScript object types, allowing an
 attacker to inject malicious code. This code could be executed when
 deserialized by a web browser, causing Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
 This issue is critical in environments where serialized data is sent to web
 clients, potentially compromising the security of the website or web
 application using this package.
