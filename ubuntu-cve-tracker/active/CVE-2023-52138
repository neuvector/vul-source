Description:
 Engrampa is an archive manager for the MATE environment. Engrampa is found
 to be vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability that can be leveraged to
 achieve full Remote Command Execution (RCE) on the target. While handling
 CPIO archives, the Engrampa Archive manager follows symlink, cpio by
 default will follow stored symlinks while extracting and the Archiver will
 not check the symlink location, which leads to arbitrary file writes to
 unintended locations. When the victim extracts the archive, the attacker
 can craft a malicious cpio or ISO archive to achieve RCE on the target
 system. This vulnerability was fixed in commit 63d5dfa.
