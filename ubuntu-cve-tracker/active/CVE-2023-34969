Description:
 D-Bus before 1.15.6 sometimes allows unprivileged users to crash
 dbus-daemon. If a privileged user with control over the dbus-daemon is
 using the org.freedesktop.DBus.Monitoring interface to monitor message bus
 traffic, then an unprivileged user with the ability to connect to the same
 dbus-daemon can cause a dbus-daemon crash under some circumstances via an
 unreplyable message. When done on the well-known system bus, this is a
 denial-of-service vulnerability. The fixed versions are 1.12.28, 1.14.8,
 and 1.15.6.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This is only an issue if a privileged user is currently using a
 mdeslaur> debugging tool, and only causes a DoS, so setting priority to
 mdeslaur> low.
 mdeslaur> 1.8.x and older are not affected.
