Description:
 It was found that JGroups did not require necessary headers for encrypt and
 auth protocols from new nodes joining the cluster. An attacker could use
 this flaw to bypass security restrictions, and use this vulnerability to
 send and receive messages within the cluster, leading to information
 disclosure, message spoofing, or further possible attacks.
