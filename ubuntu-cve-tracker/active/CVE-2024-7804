Description:
 A deserialization vulnerability exists in the Pytorch RPC framework
 (torch.distributed.rpc) in pytorch/pytorch versions <=2.3.1. The
 vulnerability arises from the lack of security verification during the
 deserialization process of PythonUDF objects in
 pytorch/torch/distributed/rpc/internal.py. This flaw allows an attacker to
 execute arbitrary code remotely by sending a malicious serialized PythonUDF
 object, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the master node.
