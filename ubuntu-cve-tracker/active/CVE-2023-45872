Description:
 An issue was discovered in Qt before 6.2.11 and 6.3.x through 6.6.x before
 6.6.1. When a QML image refers to an image whose content is not known yet,
 there is an assumption that it is an SVG document, leading to a denial of
 service (application crash) if it is not actually an SVG document.
