Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability in the Graphite FunctionDescription
 tooltip. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due the value of the
 Function Description was not properly sanitized. An attacker needs to have
 control over the Graphite data source in order to manipulate a function
 description and a Grafana admin needs to configure the data source, later a
 Grafana user needs to select a tampered function and hover over the
 description. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.22, 9.2.15 and 9.3.11 to
 receive a fix.
