Description:
 When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an
 attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that
 triggers an illegal memory access (double-free) and crash of DNSdist,
 causing a denial of service.
 
 The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version.
 
 A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has
 been upgraded to a fixed version.
 
 We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our
 attention.
