Description:
 An issue was discovered in libgpac.a in GPAC 0.8.0, as demonstrated by
 MP4Box. audio_sample_entry_Read in isomedia/box_code_base.c does not
 properly decide when to make gf_isom_box_del calls. This leads to various
 use-after-free outcomes involving mdia_Read, gf_isom_delete_movie, and
 gf_isom_parse_movie_boxes.
