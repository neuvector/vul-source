Description:
 Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit.
 In Asterisk versions 18.20.0 and prior, 20.5.0 and prior, and 21.0.0; as
 well as ceritifed-asterisk 18.9-cert5 and prior, the 'update' functionality
 of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed the available buffer space
 for storing the new value of a header. By doing so this can overwrite
 memory or cause a crash. This is not externally exploitable, unless
 dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based on data from an
 outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used the vulnerability
 does not occur. A patch is available at commit
 a1ca0268254374b515fa5992f01340f7717113fa.
