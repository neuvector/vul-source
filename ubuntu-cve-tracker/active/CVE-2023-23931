Description:
 cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and
 recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into`
 would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but
 provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as
 `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and
 resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This
 issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in
 cryptography 1.8.

 mdeslaur> Per the upstream advisory: "This is a soundness bug -- it allows
 mdeslaur> programmers to misuse an API, it cannot be exploited by attacker
 mdeslaur> controlled data alone."
