Description:
 RabbitMQ is a messaging and streaming broker. In versions 3.13.7 and prior,
 RabbitMQ is logging authorization headers in plaintext encoded in base64.
 When querying RabbitMQ api with HTTP/s with basic authentication it creates
 logs with all headers in request, including authorization headers which
 show base64 encoded username:password. This is easy to decode and
 afterwards could be used to obtain control to the system depending on
 credentials. This issue has been patched in version 4.0.8.
