Description:
 When the webdriver for the Browser object downloads data from a HTTP
 server, the data pointer is set to NULL and is allocated only in
 curl_write_cb when receiving data. If the server's response is an empty
 document, then wd->data in the code below will remain NULL and an attempt
 to read from it will result in a crash.
