Description:
 An issue was discovered in Tcpreplay 4.3.0 beta1. A heap-based buffer
 over-read was triggered in the function dlt_en10mb_encode() of the file
 plugins/dlt_en10mb/en10mb.c, due to inappropriate values in the function
 memmove(). The length (pktlen + ctx -> l2len) can be larger than source
 value (packet + ctx->l2len) because the function fails to ensure the length
 of a packet is valid. This leads to Denial of Service.
