Description:
 When serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system,
 Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.39, 8.5.0 to
 8.5.59 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.106 were susceptible to JSP source code disclosure
 in some configurations. The root cause was the unexpected behaviour of the
 JRE API File.getCanonicalPath() which in turn was caused by the
 inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API (FindFirstFileW) in some
 circumstances.
