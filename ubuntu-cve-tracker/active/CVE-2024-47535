Description:
 Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for
 rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers &
 clients. An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a
 denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty
 attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a
 large file, the Netty application crashes. This vulnerability is fixed in
 4.1.115.
