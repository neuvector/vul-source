Description:
 AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. Versions 3.13.2 and below allow a request to be crafted in such a
 way that an AIOHTTP server's memory fills up uncontrollably during
 processing. If an application includes a handler that uses the
 Request.post() method, an attacker may be able to freeze the server by
 exhausting the memory. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.
