Description:
 A flaw was found in libnbd. A server can reply with a block size larger
 than 2^63 (the NBD spec states the size is a 64-bit unsigned value). This
 issue could lead to an application crash or other unintended behavior for
 NBD clients that doesn't treat the return value of the nbd_get_size()
 function correctly.
