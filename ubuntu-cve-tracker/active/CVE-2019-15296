Description:
 An issue was discovered in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8.
 The faad_resetbits function in libfaad/bits.c is affected by a buffer
 overflow vulnerability. The number of bits to be read is determined by
 ld->buffer_size - words*4, cast to uint32. If ld->buffer_size - words*4 is
 negative, a buffer overflow is later performed via
 getdword_n(&ld->start[words], ld->bytes_left).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 incorrectly
 handled certain mp4 files. An attacker could possibly use this issue
 to cause a denial of service.
