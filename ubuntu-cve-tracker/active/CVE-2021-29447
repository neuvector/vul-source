Description:
 Wordpress is an open source CMS. A user with the ability to upload files
 (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue in the Media Library
 leading to XXE attacks. This requires WordPress installation to be using
 PHP 8. Access to internal files is possible in a successful XXE attack.
 This has been patched in WordPress version 5.7.1, along with the older
 affected versions via a minor release. We strongly recommend you keep
 auto-updates enabled.
