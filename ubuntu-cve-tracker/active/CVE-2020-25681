Description:
 A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer
 overflow was discovered in the way RRSets are sorted before validating with
 DNSSEC data. An attacker on the network, who can forge DNS replies such as
 that they are accepted as valid, could use this flaw to cause a buffer
 overflow with arbitrary data in a heap memory segment, possibly executing
 code on the machine. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
 confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
