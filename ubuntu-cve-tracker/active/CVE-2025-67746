Description:
 Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. In versions on the 2.x branch
 prior to 2.2.26 and 2.9.3, attackers controlling remote sources that
 Composer downloads from might in some way inject ANSI control characters in
 the terminal output of various Composer commands, causing mangled output
 and potentially leading to confusion or DoS of the terminal application.
 There is no proven exploit and this has thus a low severity but we still
 publish a CVE as it has potential for abuse, and we want to be on the safe
 side informing users that they should upgrade. Versions 2.2.26 and 2.9.3
 contain a patch for the issue.
