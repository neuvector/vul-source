Description:
 WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in
 PHP and paired with a MariaDB database. Due to lack of proper sanitization
 in one of the classes, there's potential for unintended SQL queries to be
 executed. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.8.3. Older affected
 versions are also fixed via security release, that go back till 4.1.34. We
 strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known
 workarounds for this issue.
