Description:
 If the `recursive-clients` quota is reached on a BIND 9 resolver configured
 with both `stale-answer-enable yes;` and `stale-answer-client-timeout 0;`,
 a sequence of serve-stale-related lookups could cause `named` to loop and
 terminate unexpectedly due to a stack overflow. This issue affects BIND 9
 versions 9.16.33 through 9.16.41, 9.18.7 through 9.18.15, 9.16.33-S1
 through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.15-S1.
