Description:
 django-registration is a user registration package for Django. The
 django-registration package provides tools for implementing user-account
 registration flows in the Django web framework. In django-registration
 prior to 3.1.2, the base user-account registration view did not properly
 apply filters to sensitive data, with the result that sensitive data could
 be included in error reports rather than removed automatically by Django.
 Triggering this requires: A site is using django-registration < 3.1.2, The
 site has detailed error reports (such as Django's emailed error reports to
 site staff/developers) enabled and a server-side error (HTTP 5xx) occurs
 during an attempt by a user to register an account. Under these conditions,
 recipients of the detailed error report will see all submitted data from
 the account-registration attempt, which may include the user's proposed
 credentials (such as a password).
