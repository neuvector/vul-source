Description:
 The “ipaddress” module contained incorrect information about whether
 certain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were designated as “globally reachable” or
 “private”. This affected the is_private and is_global properties of the
 ipaddress.IPv4Address, ipaddress.IPv4Network, ipaddress.IPv6Address, and
 ipaddress.IPv6Network classes, where values wouldn’t be returned in
 accordance with the latest information from the IANA Special-Purpose
 Address Registries. CPython 3.12.4 and 3.13.0a6 contain updated information
 from these registries and thus have the intended behavior.
