Description:
 A flaw was found in the cookie parsing logic of the libsoup HTTP library,
 used in GNOME applications and other software. The vulnerability arises
 when processing the expiration date of cookies, where a specially crafted
 value can trigger an integer overflow. This may result in undefined
 behavior, allowing an attacker to bypass cookie expiration logic, causing
 persistent or unintended cookie behavior. The issue stems from improper
 validation of large integer inputs during date arithmetic operations within
 the cookie parsing routines.
