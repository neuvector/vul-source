Description:
 Integer overflow in the LZO algorithm variant in Oberhumer liblzo2 and
 lzo-2 before 2.07 on 32-bit platforms might allow remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted Literal Run.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray| grub2 has a vendored copy of minilzo which is part of lzo2 so
  likely any vulnerabilities that affect lzo2 may also affect minilzo in
  grub2 and hence grub2-signed
 mdeslaur> grub2 since bug 1911440 now pulls in the system lzo2 when
 mdeslaur> building, so focal+ is fixed
 mdeslaur> grub2-signed on bionic now ships the grub binary built on a
 mdeslaur> later release, so it is not vulnerable to this CVE
