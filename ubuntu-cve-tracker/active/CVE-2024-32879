Description:
 Python Social Auth is a social authentication/registration mechanism. Prior
 to version 5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or
 MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not
 case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This issue has been
 addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would
 be to change collation of the affected field.
