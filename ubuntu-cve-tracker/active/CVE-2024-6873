 https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/security/advisories/GHSA-432f-r822-j66f
Description:
 It is possible to crash or redirect the execution flow of the ClickHouse
 server process from an unauthenticated vector by sending a specially
 crafted request to the ClickHouse server native interface. This redirection
 is limited to what is available within a 256-byte range of memory at the
 time of execution, and no known remote code execution (RCE) code has been
 produced or exploited.
 
  Fixes have been merged to all currently supported version of
 ClickHouse. If you are maintaining your own forked version of ClickHouse or
 using an older version and cannot upgrade, the fix for this vulnerability
 can be found in this commit 
 https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64024 .
