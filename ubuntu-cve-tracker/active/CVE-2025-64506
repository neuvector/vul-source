Description:
 LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create,
 and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From
 version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability
 exists in libpng's png_write_image_8bit function when processing 8-bit
 images through the simplified write API with convert_to_8bit enabled. The
 vulnerability affects 8-bit grayscale+alpha, RGB/RGBA, and images with
 incomplete row data. A conditional guard incorrectly allows 8-bit input to
 enter code expecting 16-bit input, causing reads up to 2 bytes beyond
 allocated buffer boundaries. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.
