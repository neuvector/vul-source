Description:
 GLPI through 9.4.3 is prone to account takeover by abusing the
 ajax/autocompletion.php autocompletion feature. The lack of correct
 validation leads to recovery of the token generated via the password reset
 functionality, and thus an authenticated attacker can set an arbitrary
 password for any user. This vulnerability can be exploited to take control
 of admin account. This vulnerability could be also abused to obtain other
 sensitive fields like API keys or password hashes.
