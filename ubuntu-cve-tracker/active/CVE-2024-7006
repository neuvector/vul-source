Description:
 A null pointer dereference flaw was found in Libtiff via `tif_dirinfo.c`.
 This issue may allow an attacker to trigger memory allocation failures
 through certain means, such as restricting the heap space size or injecting
 faults, causing a segmentation fault. This can cause an application crash,
 eventually leading to a denial of service.
