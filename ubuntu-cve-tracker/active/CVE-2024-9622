Description:
 A vulnerability was found in the resteasy-netty4 library arising from
 improper handling of HTTP requests using smuggling techniques. When an HTTP
 smuggling request with an ASCII control character is sent, it causes the
 Netty HttpObjectDecoder to transition into a BAD_MESSAGE state. As a
 result, any subsequent legitimate requests on the same connection are
 ignored, leading to client timeouts, which may impact systems using load
 balancers and expose them to risk.
