Description:
 A flaw was found in openstack-mistral. By manipulating the SSH private key
 filename, the std.ssh action can be used to disclose the presence of
 arbitrary files within the filesystem of the executor running the action.
 Since std.ssh private_key_filename can take an absolute path, it can be
 used to assess whether or not a file exists on the executor's filesystem.
