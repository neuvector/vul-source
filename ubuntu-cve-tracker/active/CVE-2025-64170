Description:
 sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust.
 Starting in version 0.2.7 and prior to version 0.2.10, if a user begins
 entering a password but does not press return for an extended period, a
 password timeout may occur. When this happens, the keystrokes that were
 entered are echoed back to the console. This could reveal partial password
 information, possibly exposing history files when not carefully handled by
 the user and on screen, usable for Social Engineering or Pass-By attacks.
 Version 0.2.10 fixes the issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> passwords timeouts were added in sudo-rs 0.2.7, so versions
  prior to that are not affected.
 rodrigo-zaiden> USN-7867-1 references LP bug 2130623 but not the CVE
  because the CVE was assigned later than the package update publication,
  but it refers to the fix for this issue on questing.
