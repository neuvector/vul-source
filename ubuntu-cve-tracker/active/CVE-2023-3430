Description:
 A vulnerability was found in OpenImageIO, where a heap buffer overflow
 exists in the src/gif.imageio/gifinput.cpp file. This flaw allows a remote
 attacker to pass a specially crafted file to the application, which
 triggers a heap-based buffer overflow and could cause a crash, leading to a
 denial of service.
