Description:
 WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via user
 display names in the Avatar block in various versions up to 6.5.2 due to
 insufficient output escaping on the display name. This makes it possible
 for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
 inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
 accesses an injected page. In addition, it also makes it possible for
 unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
 have the comment block present and display the comment author's avatar.
