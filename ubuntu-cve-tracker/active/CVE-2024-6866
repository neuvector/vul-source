Description:
 corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.01 contains a vulnerability where the
 request path matching is case-insensitive due to the use of the `try_match`
 function, which is originally intended for matching hosts. This results in
 a mismatch because paths in URLs are case-sensitive, but the regex matching
 treats them as case-insensitive. This misconfiguration can lead to
 significant security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized origins to
 access paths meant to be restricted, resulting in data exposure and
 potential data leaks.
