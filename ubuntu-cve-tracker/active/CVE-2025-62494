Description:
 A type confusion vulnerability exists in the handling of the string
 addition (+) operation within the QuickJS engine.
 
   *  The code first checks if the left-hand operand is a string.
 
 
   *  It then attempts to convert the right-hand operand to a primitive
 value using JS_ToPrimitiveFree. This conversion can trigger a callback
 (e.g., toString or valueOf).
 
 
   *  During this callback, an attacker can modify the type of the left-hand
 operand in memory, changing it from a string to a different type (e.g., an
 object or an array).
 
 
   *  The code then proceeds to call JS_ConcatStringInPlace, which still
 treats the modified left-hand value as a string.
 
 
 This mismatch between the assumed type (string) and the actual type allows
 an attacker to control the data structure being processed by the
 concatenation logic, resulting in a type confusion condition. This can lead
 to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially resulting in memory corruption
 and arbitrary code execution in the context of the QuickJS runtime.
