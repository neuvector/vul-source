Description:
 A vulnerability was found in the netavark package, a network stack for
 containers used with Podman. Due to dns.podman search domain being removed,
 netavark may return external servers if a valid A/AAAA record is sent as a
 response. When creating a container with a given name, this name will be
 used as the hostname for the container itself, as the podman's search
 domain is not added anymore the container is using the host's resolv.conf,
 and the DNS resolver will try to look into the search domains contained on
 it. If one of the domains contain a name with the same hostname as the
 running container, the connection will forward to unexpected external
 servers.
