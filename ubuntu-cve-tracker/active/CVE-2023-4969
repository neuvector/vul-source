Notes:
 alexmurray> According to the upstream AMD advisory, they plan to create a
  new mode to prevent this attack and more information will be available in
  March 2024 - unsure if this will come via GPU firmware updates in
  linux-firmware but assigning this CVE there for now until we get more
  information.
