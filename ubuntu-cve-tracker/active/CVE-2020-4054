Description:
 In Sanitize (RubyGem sanitize) greater than or equal to 3.0.0 and less than
 5.2.1, there is a cross-site scripting vulnerability. When HTML is
 sanitized using Sanitize's "relaxed" config, or a custom config that allows
 certain elements, some content in a math or svg element may not be
 sanitized correctly even if math and svg are not in the allowlist. You are
 likely to be vulnerable to this issue if you use Sanitize's relaxed config
 or a custom config that allows one or more of the following HTML elements:
 iframe, math, noembed, noframes, noscript, plaintext, script, style, svg,
 xmp. Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak
 arbitrary HTML through Sanitize, potentially resulting in XSS (cross-site
 scripting) or other undesired behavior when that HTML is rendered in a
 browser. This has been fixed in 5.2.1.
