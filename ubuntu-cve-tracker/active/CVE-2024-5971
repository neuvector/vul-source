Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where the chunked response hangs
 after the body was flushed. The response headers and body were sent but the
 client would continue waiting as Undertow does not send the expected 0\r\n
 termination of the chunked response. This results in uncontrolled resource
 consumption, leaving the server side to a denial of service attack. This
 happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios.
