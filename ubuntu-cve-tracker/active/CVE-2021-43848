Description:
 h2o is an open source http server. In code prior to the `8c0eca3` commit
 h2o may attempt to access uninitialized memory. When receiving QUIC frames
 in certain order, HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o can be misguided
 to treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that have been received.
 When h2o is used as a reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this
 vulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled
 by the attacker or third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint that
 reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use that
 reflector to obtain internal state of h2o. This internal state includes
 traffic of other connections in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets.
 This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between commit
 93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the released versions of h2o are affected by
 this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds. Users of unreleased
 versions of h2o using HTTP/3 are advised to upgrade immediately.
