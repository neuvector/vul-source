Description:
 In Apache Tika, a regular expression in our StandardsText class, used by
 the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial of service
 caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only affects users
 who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a
 non-standard handler. This is fixed in 1.28.2 and 2.4.0
