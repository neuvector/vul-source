Description:
 Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::HTTP versions 1.018 and earlier for
 Perl generate nonces using the Perl Data::UUID library.
   *  Data::UUID does not use a strong cryptographic source for generating
 UUIDs.
   *  Data::UUID returns v3 UUIDs, which are generated from known
 information and are unsuitable for security, as per RFC 9562.
   *  The nonces should be generated from a strong cryptographic source, as
 per RFC 7616.
