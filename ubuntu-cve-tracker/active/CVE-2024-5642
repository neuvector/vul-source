Description:
 CPython 3.9 and earlier doesn't disallow configuring an empty list ("[]")
 for SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() which is an invalid value for the
 underlying OpenSSL API. This results in a buffer over-read when NPN is used
 (see CVE-2024-5535 for OpenSSL). This vulnerability is of low severity due
 to NPN being not widely used and specifying an empty list likely being
 uncommon in-practice (typically a protocol name would be configured).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> NPN support was disabled in Python 3.10+
 mdeslaur> Python 3.8 in focal disables NPN support with OpenSSL 1.1.1
 mdeslaur> Python 3.7 in bionic disables NPN support with OpenSSL 1.1.1
 mdeslaur> Python 3.6 in bionic disables NPN support with OpenSSL 1.1.1
Mitigation:
Bugs:
Priority: low
 Requires unlikely API usage to be vulnerable.
