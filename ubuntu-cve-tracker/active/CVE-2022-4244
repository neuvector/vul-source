Description:
 A flaw was found in codeplex-codehaus. A directory traversal attack (also
 known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories stored
 outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with "dot-dot-slash
 (../)" sequences and their variations or by using absolute file paths, it
 may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the
 file system, including application source code, configuration, and other
 critical system files.
