Description:
 ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software
 application for Linux which supports IP, USB and Analog cameras. Versions
 prior to 1.36.33 and 1.37.33 contain SQL Injection via malicious jason web
 token. The Username field of the JWT token was trusted when performing an
 SQL query to load the user.  If an attacker could determine the HASH key
 used by ZoneMinder, they could generate a malicious JWT token and use it to
 execute arbitrary SQL. This issue is fixed in versions 1.36.33 and 1.37.33.
