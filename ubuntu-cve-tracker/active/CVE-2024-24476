Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A buffer overflow in Wireshark before 4.2.0 allows a remote
 attacker to cause a denial of service via the pan/addr_resolv.c, and
 ws_manuf_lookup_str(), size components. NOTE: this is disputed by the
 vendor because neither release 4.2.0 nor any other release was affected.
