Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C. PJSIP versions 2.12 and prior do not parse incoming RTCP feedback RPSI
 (Reference Picture Selection Indication) packet, but any app that directly
 uses pjmedia_rtcp_fb_parse_rpsi() will be affected. A patch is available in
 the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. There are
 currently no known workarounds.
