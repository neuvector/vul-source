Description:
 OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
 Prior to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5, when a specially crafted SIP message is
 processed by the function `rewrite_ruri`, a crash occurs due to a
 segmentation fault. This issue causes the server to crash. It affects
 configurations containing functions that make use of the affected code,
 such as the function `setport`. This issue has been fixed in version 3.1.8
 and 3.2.5.
