Description:
 Some MongoDB Drivers may erroneously publish events containing
 authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an
 application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when
 specific authentication-related commands are executed.
 
 Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this sensitive
 information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if
 an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by
 default).
 
 This issue affects the MongoDB C Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7, MongoDB PHP
 Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.9.2, MongoDB Swift Driver 1.0.0 prior to 1.1.1,
 MongoDB Node.js Driver 3.6 prior to 3.6.10, MongoDB Node.js Driver 4.0
 prior to 4.17.0 and MongoDB Node.js Driver 5.0 prior to 5.8.0. This issue
 also affects users of the MongoDB C++ Driver dependent on the C driver
 1.0.0 prior to 1.17.7 (C++ driver prior to 3.7.0).
