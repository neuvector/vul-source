Description:
 urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Starting in
 version 1.24 and prior to 2.6.0, the number of links in the decompression
 chain was unbounded allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually
 unlimited number of compression steps leading to high CPU usage and massive
 memory allocation for the decompressed data. This vulnerability is fixed in
 2.6.0.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3 binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-urllib3 is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
