Description:
 A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
 specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
 certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have
 signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue
 certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
 issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to
 overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal
 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a
 denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to
 a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server
 requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.
