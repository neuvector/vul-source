Description:
 A flaw was found in mbsync in isync 1.4.0 through 1.4.3. Due to an
 unchecked condition, a malicious or compromised IMAP server could use a
 crafted mail message that lacks headers (i.e., one that starts with an
 empty line) to provoke a heap overflow, which could conceivably be
 exploited for remote code execution.

Notes:
 seth-arnold> I can't find a fix for this in the source browser; I'm marking
  jammy as 'needed' and others as 'not-affected' based on the version number,
  but I distrust the upper end of the '1.4.0 through 1.4.3' range given in
  the CVE description. I suspect "unfixed" is the more correct upper range.
