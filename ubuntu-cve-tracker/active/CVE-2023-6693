Description:
 A stack based buffer overflow was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU.
 This issue occurs when flushing TX in the virtio_net_flush_tx function if
 guest features VIRTIO_NET_F_HASH_REPORT, VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 and
 VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF are enabled. This could allow a malicious user to
 overwrite local variables allocated on the stack. Specifically, the
 `out_sg` variable could be used to read a part of process memory and send
 it to the wire, causing an information leak.
