Description:
 OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
 Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, a specially crafted Authorization header
 causes OpenSIPS to crash or behave in an unexpected way due to a bug in the
 function `parse_param_name()` . This issue was discovered while performing
 coverage guided fuzzing of the function parse_msg. The AddressSanitizer
 identified that the issue occurred in the function `q_memchr()` which is
 being called by the function `parse_param_name()`. This issue may cause
 erratic program behaviour or a server crash. It affects configurations
 containing functions that make use of the affected code, such as the
 function `www_authorize()` . Versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 contain a fix.
