Description:
 An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository
 that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a
 resource certificate containing an Authority Key Identifier extension that
 lacks the keyIdentifier field. Fort references this pointer without
 sanitizing it first. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a crash can
 lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to
 compromised routing.
