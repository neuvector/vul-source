Description:
 LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and the related
 bits and pieces. Prior to version 0.5.49, unbounded processing of HTTP
 request and response headers can lead to excessive CPU time and memory
 utilization, possibly leading to extreme slowdowns. This issue is addressed
 in 0.5.49.
