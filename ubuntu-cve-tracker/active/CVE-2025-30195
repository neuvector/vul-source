Description:
 An attacker can publish a zone containing specific Resource Record Sets.
 Processing and caching results for these sets can lead to an illegal memory
 accesses and crash of the Recursor, causing a denial of service.
 
 The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 5.2.1 version.
 
 We would like to thank Volodymyr Ilyin for bringing this issue to our
 attention.
