Description:
 aiomysql is a library for accessing a MySQL database from the asyncio.
 Prior to version 0.3.0, the client-side settings are not checked before
 sending local files to MySQL server, which allows obtaining arbitrary files
 from the client using a rogue server. It is possible to create a rogue
 MySQL server that emulates authorization, ignores client flags and requests
 arbitrary files from the client by sending a LOAD_LOCAL instruction packet.
 This issue has been patched in version 0.3.0.
