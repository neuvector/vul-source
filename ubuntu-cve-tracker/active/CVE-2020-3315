Description:
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
 detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
 bypass the configured file policies on an affected system. The
 vulnerability is due to errors in how the Snort detection engine handles
 specific HTTP responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
 sending crafted HTTP packets that would flow through an affected system. A
 successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured file
 policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network.
