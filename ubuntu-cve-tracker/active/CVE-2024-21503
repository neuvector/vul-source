Description:
 Versions of the package black before 24.3.0 are vulnerable to Regular
 Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the
 lines_with_leading_tabs_expanded function in the strings.py file. An
 attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious input
 that causes a denial of service. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible
 when running Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands
 of leading tab characters in your docstrings.
