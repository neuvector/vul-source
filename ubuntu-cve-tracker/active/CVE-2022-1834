Description:
 When displaying the sender of an email, and the sender name contained the
 Braille Pattern Blank space character multiple times, Thunderbird would
 have displayed all the spaces. This could have been used by an attacker to
 send an email message with the attacker's digital signature, that was shown
 with an arbitrary sender email address chosen by the attacker. If the
 sender name started with a false email address, followed by many Braille
 space characters, the attacker's email address was not visible. Because
 Thunderbird compared the invisible sender address with the signature's
 email address, if the signing key or certificate was accepted by
 Thunderbird, the email was shown as having a valid digital signature. This
 vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10.
