Description:
 In ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.6, certain destination constraints can be
 incompletely applied. When destination constraints are specified during
 addition of PKCS#11-hosted private keys, these constraints are only applied
 to the first key, even if a PKCS#11 token returns multiple keys.
