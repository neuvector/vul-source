Description:
 Access control for plugin data sources protected by the ReqActions json
 field of the plugin.json is bypassed if the user or service account is
 granted associated access to any other data source, as the ReqActions check
 was not scoped to each specific datasource. The account must have prior
 query access to the impacted datasource.
