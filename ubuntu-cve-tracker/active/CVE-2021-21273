Description:
 Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
 matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant
 Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, requests to user
 provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses when
 calculating the key validity for third-party invite events and sending push
 notifications. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal
 infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user,
 although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the most
 thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated
 `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to
 Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP
 address restrictions. See the new `ip_range_blacklist` and
 `ip_range_whitelist` settings if more specific control is necessary.
