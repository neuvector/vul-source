 https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/releases/tag/v0.30.0
Description:
 cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS
 library. Prior to version 0.30.0, the ``write_headers`` function does not
 check for CR & LF characters in user supplied headers, allowing untrusted
 header value to escape header lines.
 This vulnerability allows attackers to add extra headers, modify request
 body unexpectedly & trigger an SSRF attack. When combined with a server
 that supports http1.1 pipelining (springboot, python twisted etc), this can
 be used for server side request forgery (SSRF). Version 0.30.0 fixes this
 issue.
