Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users
 to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by leveraging the erroneous
 enabling of interrupts. Interrupts are unconditionally unmasked in
 exception handlers. When an exception occurs on an ARM system which is
 handled without changing processor level, some interrupts are
 unconditionally enabled during exception entry. So exceptions which occur
 when interrupts are masked will effectively unmask the interrupts. A
 malicious guest might contrive to arrange for critical Xen code to run with
 interrupts erroneously enabled. This could lead to data corruption, denial
 of service, or possibly even privilege escalation. However a precise attack
 technique has not been identified.
