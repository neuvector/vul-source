Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The option parser
 allows an attacker to write past the end of a heap-allocated buffer by
 calling certain commands with a large number of specific short forms of
 options. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
 confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that the option parser in GRUB 2 contained a heap
 overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute
 arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes: 
 sbeattie| grub2-unsigned will contain fixes and supersede grub2, which
  will contain only BIOS grub bits.
