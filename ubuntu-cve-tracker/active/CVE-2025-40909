Description:
 Perl threads have a working directory race condition where file operations
 may target unintended paths.
 
 If a directory handle is open at thread creation, the process-wide current
 working directory is temporarily changed in order to clone that handle for
 the new thread, which is visible from any third (or more) thread already
 running.
 
 This may lead to unintended operations such as loading code or accessing
 files from unexpected locations, which a local attacker may be able to
 exploit.
 
 The bug was introduced in commit 11a11ecf4bea72b17d250cfb43c897be1341861e
 and released in Perl version 5.13.6
