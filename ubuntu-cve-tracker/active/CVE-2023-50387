Description:
 Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840,
 and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
 consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the "KeyTrap" issue. One
 of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG
 records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate
 all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
