Description:
 pycares is a Python module which provides an interface to c-ares. c-ares is
 a C library that performs DNS requests and name resolutions asynchronously.
 Prior to version 4.9.0, pycares is vulnerable to a use-after-free condition
 that occurs when a Channel object is garbage collected while DNS queries
 are still pending. This results in a fatal Python error and interpreter
 crash. The vulnerability has been fixed in pycares 4.9.0 by implementing a
 safe channel destruction mechanism.
