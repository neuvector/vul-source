Description:
 FluidSynth is a software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2
 specifications. From versions 2.5.0 to before 2.5.2, a race condition
 during unloading of a DLS file can trigger a heap-based use-after-free. A
 concurrently running thread may be pending to unload a DLS file, leading to
 use of freed memory, if the synthesizer is being concurrently destroyed, or
 samples of the (unloaded) DLS file are concurrently used to synthesize
 audio. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.2. The problem will not
 occur, when explicitly unloading a DLS file (before synth destruction),
 provided that at the time of unloading, no samples of the respective file
 are used by active voices. The problem will not occur in versions of
 FluidSynth that have been compiled without native DLS support.
