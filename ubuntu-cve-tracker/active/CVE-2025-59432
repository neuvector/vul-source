Description:
 SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) is part of the
 family of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422)
 authentication mechanisms. Prior to version 3.2, a timing attack
 vulnerability exists in the SCRAM Java implementation. The issue arises
 because Arrays.equals was used to compare secret values such as client
 proofs and server signatures. Since Arrays.equals performs a short-circuit
 comparison, the execution time varies depending on how many leading bytes
 match. This behavior could allow an attacker to perform a timing
 side-channel attack and potentially infer sensitive authentication
 material. All users relying on SCRAM authentication are impacted. This
 vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1 by replacing Arrays.equals
 with MessageDigest.isEqual, which ensures constant-time comparison.
