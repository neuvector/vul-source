Description:
 When parsing the header for a DHAV file, there's an integer underflow in
 offset calculation that leads to reading the duration from before the start
 of the allocated buffer.
 
 If we load a DHAV file that is larger than MAX_DURATION_BUFFER_SIZE bytes
 (0x100000) for example 0x101000 bytes, then at [0] we have size = 0x101000.
 At [1] we have end_buffer_size = 0x100000, and at [2] we have
 end_buffer_pos = 0x1000.
 
 The loop then scans backwards through the buffer looking for the dhav tag;
 when it is found, we'll calculate end_pos based on a 32-bit offset read
 from the buffer.
 
 There is subsequently a check [3] that end_pos is within the section of the
 file that has been copied into end_buffer, but it only correctly handles
 the cases where end_pos is before the start of the file or after the
 section copied into end_buffer, and not the case where end_pos is within
 the the file, but before the section copied into end_buffer. If we provide
 such an offset, (end_pos - end_buffer_pos) can underflow, resulting in the
 subsequent access at [4] occurring before the beginning of the allocation.
 
 We recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.
