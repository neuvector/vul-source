Description:
 It's been found that multiple functions in ipmitool before 1.8.19 neglect
 proper checking of the data received from a remote LAN party, which may
 lead to buffer overflows and potentially to remote code execution on the
 ipmitool side. This is especially dangerous if ipmitool is run as a
 privileged user. This problem is fixed in version 1.8.19.
