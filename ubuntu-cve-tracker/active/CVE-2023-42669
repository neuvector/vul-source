Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Samba's "rpcecho" development server, a
 non-Windows RPC server used to test Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements. This
 vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked indefinitely.
 The issue arises because the "rpcecho" service operates with only one
 worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the "rpcecho" server to be
 blocked for a specified time, causing service disruptions. This disruption
 is triggered by a "sleep()" call in the "dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()" function
 under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit
 this vulnerability to make calls to the "rpcecho" server, requesting it to
 block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and
 leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all
 other services as "rpcecho" runs in the main RPC task.
