Description:
 tracing is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
 structured, event-based diagnostic information. Prior to version 0.3.20,
 tracing-subscriber was vulnerable to ANSI escape sequence injection
 attacks. Untrusted user input containing ANSI escape sequences could be
 injected into terminal output when logged, potentially allowing attackers
 to manipulate terminal title bars, clear screens or modify terminal
 display, and potentially mislead users through terminal manipulation.
 tracing-subscriber version 0.3.20 fixes this vulnerability by escaping ANSI
 control characters when writing events to destinations that may be printed
 to the terminal. A workaround involves avoiding printing logs to terminal
 emulators without escaping ANSI control sequences.
