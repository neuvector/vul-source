Description:
 A regression in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.60 ignores some use of
 the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers.   "AddType" and
 similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested
 indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example,
 PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.61, which fixes this issue.
