Description:
 Applications that use UriComponentsBuilder in Spring Framework to parse an
 externally provided URL (e.g. through a query parameter) AND perform
 validation checks on the host of the parsed URL may be vulnerable to a open
 redirect https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html attack or to a
 SSRF attack if the URL is used after passing validation checks. This is the
 same as CVE-2024-22243 https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-22243 , but with
 different input.
