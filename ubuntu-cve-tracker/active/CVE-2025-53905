Description:
 Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.1552,
 a path traversal issue in Vimâ€™s tar.vim plugin can allow overwriting of
 arbitrary files when opening specially crafted tar archives. Impact is low
 because this exploit requires direct user interaction. However,
 successfully exploitation can lead to overwriting sensitive files or
 placing executable code in privileged locations, depending on the
 permissions of the process editing the archive. The victim must edit such a
 file using Vim which will reveal the filename and the file content, a
 careful user may suspect some strange things going on. Successful
 exploitation could results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands on
 the underlying operating system. Version 9.1.1552 contains a patch for the
 vulnerability.
