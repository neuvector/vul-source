Description:
 Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting
 Python 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0rc1, the Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server,
 located in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed several HTTP request
 constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230. This non-conformant
 parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers,
 potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling. Users who may be affected
 use Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy and also pass requests
 through a different HTTP server and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client is not
 affected. The HTTP 2.0 server uses a different parser, so it is not
 affected. The issue has been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1. Two
 workarounds are available: Ensure any vulnerabilities in upstream proxies
 have been addressed, such as by upgrading them; or filter malformed
 requests by other means, such as configuration of an upstream proxy.

Notes:
 rayveldkamp> For focal and earlier, patch requires backporting major
 rayveldkamp> changes to how HTTP packets are buffered and processed
 rayveldkamp> which is intrusive and could have high risk of regression.
