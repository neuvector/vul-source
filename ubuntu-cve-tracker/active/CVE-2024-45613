Description:
 CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich-text editor. Starting in version 40.0.0 and
 prior to version 43.1.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is
 present in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be
 triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript
 code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into
 the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration.
 This vulnerability only affects installations where the Block Toolbar
 plugin is enabled and either the General HTML Support (with a configuration
 that permits unsafe markup) or the HTML Embed plugin is also enabled. A fix
 for the problem is available in version 43.1.1. As a workaround, one may
 disable the block toolbar plugin.
