Description:
 Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking
 excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact
 summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generate
 an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use
 DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to
 check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
 Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
 an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH_check()
 performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key()
 doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable for
 excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH_generate_key()
 performs a check for an excessively large P, it doesn't check for an
 excessively large Q. An application that calls DH_generate_key() or
 DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an
 untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.
 DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of
 other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other
 functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this
 are DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and
 EVP_PKEY_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line
 application when using the "-pubcheck" option, as well as the OpenSSL
 genpkey command line application. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not
 affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not
 affected by this issue.
