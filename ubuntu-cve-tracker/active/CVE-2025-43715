Description:
 Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) before 3.11 on Windows allows
 local users to escalate privileges to SYSTEM during an installation,
 because the temporary plugins directory is created under %WINDIR%\temp and
 unprivileged users can place a crafted executable file by winning a race
 condition. This occurs because EW_CREATEDIR does not always set the
 CreateRestrictedDirectory error flag.
