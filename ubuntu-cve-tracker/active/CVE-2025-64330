Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to
 versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a single byte read heap overflow when logging
 the verdict in eve.alert and eve.drop records can lead to crashes. This
 requires the per packet alert queue to be filled with alerts and then
 followed by a pass rule. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and
 8.0.2. To reduce the likelihood of this issue occurring, the alert queue
 size a should be increased (packet-alert-max in suricata.yaml) if verdict
 is enabled.
