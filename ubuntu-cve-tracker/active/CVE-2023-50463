Description:
 The caddy-geo-ip (aka GeoIP) middleware through 0.6.0 for Caddy 2, when
 trust_header X-Forwarded-For is used, allows attackers to spoof their
 source IP address via an X-Forwarded-For header, which may bypass a
 protection mechanism (trusted_proxy directive in reverse_proxy or IP
 address range restrictions).
