Description:
 The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
 decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload
 data. If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data"
 arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant
 decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is
 possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data.
 In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate
 the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.
 If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This
 will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker
 who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a
 denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are
 simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are
 also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a
 number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and
 SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL
 internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does
 not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code.
 These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the
 decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line
 application is also impacted by this issue.
