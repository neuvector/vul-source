Description:
 The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
 decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload
 data.
 If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data" arguments
 are
 populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data.
 The
 caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to
 construct a
 PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case
 PEM_read_bio_ex()
 will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a
 pointer
 to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this
 buffer
 then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This
 could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious
 PEM
 files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.
 
 The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around
 PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.
 
 These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
 functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and
 SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL
 internal
 uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free
 the
 header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These
 locations
 include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders
 introduced in
 OpenSSL 3.0.
 
 The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this
 issue.
