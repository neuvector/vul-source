Description:
 Academy Software Foundation OpenEXR EXR File Parsing Heap-based Buffer
 Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of
 Academy Software Foundation OpenEXR. User interaction is required to
 exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page
 or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EXR files. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data
 prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
 vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was
 ZDI-CAN-27948.
