Description:
 The fb_unserialize function did not impose a depth limit for nested
 deserialization. That meant a maliciously constructed string could cause
 deserialization to recurse, leading to stack exhaustion. This issue
 affected HHVM prior to v4.32.3, between versions 4.33.0 and 4.56.0, 4.57.0,
 4.58.0, 4.58.1, 4.59.0, 4.60.0, 4.61.0, 4.62.0.
