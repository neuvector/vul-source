Description:
 A flaw was found in GNU Coreutils. The sort utility's begfield() function
 is vulnerable to a heap buffer under-read. The program may access memory
 outside the allocated buffer if a user runs a crafted command using the
 traditional key format. A malicious input could lead to a crash or leak
 sensitive data.
