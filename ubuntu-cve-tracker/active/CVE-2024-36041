Description:
 KSmserver in KDE Plasma Workspace (aka plasma-workspace) before 5.27.11.1
 and 6.x before 6.0.5.1 allows connections via ICE based purely on the host,
 i.e., all local connections are accepted. This allows another user on the
 same machine to gain access to the session manager, e.g., use the
 session-restore feature to execute arbitrary code as the victim (on the
 next boot) via earlier use of the /tmp directory.
