Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting
 (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data
 stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by
 administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's
 browser at view-time. The script under `data_sources.php` displays the data
 source management information (e.g. data source path, polling
 configuration, device name related to the datasource etc.) for different
 data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary
 that is able to configure a malicious device name, can deploy a stored XSS
 attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that
 possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can
 configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through
 `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is
 exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This vulnerability has
 been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
 unable to update should manually filter HTML output.
