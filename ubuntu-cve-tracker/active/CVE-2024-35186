Description:
 gitoxide is a pure Rust implementation of Git. During checkout,
 `gix-worktree-state` does not verify that paths point to locations in the
 working tree. A specially crafted repository can, when cloned, place new
 files anywhere writable by the application. This vulnerability leads to a
 major loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but creating
 files outside a working tree without attempting to execute code can
 directly impact integrity as well. This vulnerability has been patched in
 version(s) 0.36.0.
