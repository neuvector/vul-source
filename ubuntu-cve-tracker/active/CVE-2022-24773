Description:
 Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport
 Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5
 signature verification code does not properly check `DigestInfo` for a
 proper ASN.1 structure. This can lead to successful verification with
 signatures that contain invalid structures but a valid digest. The issue
 has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no
 known workarounds.
