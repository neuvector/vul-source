Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 5.1 before 5.1.5, 5.0 before 5.0.11, and
 4.2 before 4.2.18. Lack of upper-bound limit enforcement in strings passed
 when performing IPv6 validation could lead to a potential denial-of-service
 attack. The undocumented and private functions clean_ipv6_address and
 is_valid_ipv6_address are vulnerable, as is the
 django.forms.GenericIPAddressField form field. (The
 django.db.models.GenericIPAddressField model field is not affected.)
