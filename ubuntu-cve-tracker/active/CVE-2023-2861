Description:
 A flaw was found in the 9p passthrough filesystem (9pfs) implementation in
 QEMU. The 9pfs server did not prohibit opening special files on the host
 side, potentially allowing a malicious client to escape from the exported
 9p tree by creating and opening a device file in the shared folder.
