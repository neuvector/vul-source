Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. In affected versions an attacker can send a specially crafted POST
 (multipart/form-data) request. When the aiohttp server processes it, the
 server will enter an infinite loop and be unable to process any further
 requests. An attacker can stop the application from serving requests after
 sending a single request. This issue has been addressed in version 3.9.4.
 Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually apply a
 patch to their systems. Please see the linked GHSA for instructions.
