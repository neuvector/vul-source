Description:
 There is a stack consumption issue in md5Round1() located in Decrypt.cc in
 Xpdf 4.01. It can be triggered by sending a crafted pdf file to (for
 example) the pdfimages binary. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of
 Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
 This is related to Catalog::countPageTree.
