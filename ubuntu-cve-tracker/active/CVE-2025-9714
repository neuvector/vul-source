Description:
 Uncontrolled recursion in XPath evaluation in libxml2 up to and including
 version 2.9.14 allows a local attacker to cause a stack overflow via
 crafted expressions. XPath processing functions `xmlXPathRunEval`,
 `xmlXPathCtxtCompile`, and `xmlXPathEvalExpr` were resetting recursion
 depth to zero before making potentially recursive calls. When such
 functions were called recursively this could allow for uncontrolled
 recursion and lead to a stack overflow. These functions now preserve
 recursion depth across recursive calls, allowing recursion depth to be
 controlled.
