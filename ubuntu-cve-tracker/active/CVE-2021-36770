Description:
 Encode.pm, as distributed in Perl through 5.34.0, allows local users to
 gain privileges via a Trojan horse Encode::ConfigLocal library (in the
 current working directory) that preempts dynamic module loading.
 Exploitation requires an unusual configuration, and certain 2021 versions
 of Encode.pm (3.05 through 3.11). This issue occurs because the || operator
 evaluates @INC in a scalar context, and thus @INC has only an integer
 value.
