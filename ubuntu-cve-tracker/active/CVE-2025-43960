Description:
 Adminer 4.8.1, when using Monolog for logging, allows a Denial of Service
 (memory consumption) via a crafted serialized payload (e.g., using
 s:1000000000), leading to a PHP Object Injection issue. Remote,
 unauthenticated attackers can trigger this by sending a malicious
 serialized object, which forces excessive memory usage, rendering Adminerâ€™s
 interface unresponsive and causing a server-level DoS. While the server may
 recover after several minutes, multiple simultaneous requests can cause a
 complete crash requiring manual intervention.
