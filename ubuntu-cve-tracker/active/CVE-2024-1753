Description:
 A flaw was found in Buildah (and subsequently Podman Build) which allows
 containers to mount arbitrary locations on the host filesystem into build
 containers. A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image with a symbolic
 link to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operation
 to mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands inside
 the RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem,
 allowing for full container escape at build time.
