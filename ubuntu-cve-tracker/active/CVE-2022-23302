Description:
 JMSSink in all versions of Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of
 untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j
 configuration or if the configuration references an LDAP service the
 attacker has access to. The attacker can provide a
 TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configuration causing JMSSink to perform
 JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to
 CVE-2021-4104. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically
 configured to use JMSSink, which is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2
 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it
 addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.
