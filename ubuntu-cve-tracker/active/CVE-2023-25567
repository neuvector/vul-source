Description:
 GSS-NTLMSSP, a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM
 authentication, has an out-of-bounds read when decoding target information
 prior to version 1.2.0. The length of the `av_pair` is not checked properly
 for two of the elements which can trigger an out-of-bound read. The
 out-of-bounds read can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context`
 entry point and could cause a denial-of-service if the memory is unmapped.
 The issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.
