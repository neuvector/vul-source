Description:
 Squid is vulnerable to Denial of Service attack against HTTP and HTTPS
 clients due to an Improper Handling of Structural Elements bug.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> as of 2024-01-26, this is not fixed in the upstream 5.x
 mdeslaur> repository. The patches to fix this issue are large and
 mdeslaur> intrusive.
 mdeslaur> Per the researcher's advisory, "Of course, such 'attacks' are
 mdeslaur> completely theoretical and are only considered for entertainment
 mdeslaur> purposes."
 mdeslaur> Ubuntu 20.04 LTS was patched in USN-6728-1, but the fix
 mdeslaur> introduced crashes and was backed out in USN-6728-2. It was
 mdeslaur> ultimately fixed in USN-6728-3.
