Description:
 main/streams/xp_socket.c in PHP 7.x before 2017-03-07 misparses fsockopen
 calls, such as by interpreting fsockopen('127.0.0.1:80', 443) as if the
 address/port were 127.0.0.1:80:443, which is later truncated to
 127.0.0.1:80. This behavior has a security risk if the explicitly provided
 port number (i.e., 443 in this example) is hardcoded into an application as
 a security policy, but the hostname argument (i.e., 127.0.0.1:80 in this
 example) is obtained from untrusted input.
