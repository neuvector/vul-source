Description:
 Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. When using an ACL
 on a device connected to a bridge, Incus version 6.12 and 6.13 generates
 nftables rules for local services (DHCP, DNS...) that partially bypass
 security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and
 `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to DHCP pool exhaustion and opens
 the door for other attacks. A patch is available at commit
 2516fb19ad8428454cb4edfe70c0a5f0dc1da214.
