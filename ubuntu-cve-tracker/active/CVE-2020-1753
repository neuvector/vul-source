Description:
 A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions
 prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible
 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s
 module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to
 kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an
 input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from
 process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any
 effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.
