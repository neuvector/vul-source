Description:
 User credentials can be manipulated and stolen by Native CephFS consumers
 of OpenStack Manila, resulting in potential privilege escalation. An Open
 Stack Manila user can request access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user,
 including existing users. The access key is retrieved via the interface
 drivers. Then, all users of the requesting OpenStack project can view the
 access key. This enables the attacker to target any resource that the user
 has access to. This can be done to even "admin" users, compromising the
 ceph administrator. This flaw affects Ceph versions prior to 14.2.16, 15.x
 prior to 15.2.8, and 16.x prior to 16.2.0.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Goutham Pacha Ravi, Jahson Babel, and John Garbutt discovered that user
 credentials in Ceph could be manipulated in certain environments. An
 attacker could use this to gain unintended access to resources.
