Description:
 Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
 unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and
 full access to internals. When Git asks for credentials via a terminal
 prompt (i.e. without using any credential helper), it prints out the host
 name for which the user is expected to provide a username and/or a
 password. At this stage, any URL-encoded parts have been decoded already,
 and are printed verbatim. This allows attackers to craft URLs that contain
 ANSI escape sequences that the terminal interpret to confuse users e.g.
 into providing passwords for trusted Git hosting sites when in fact they
 are then sent to untrusted sites that are under the attacker's control.
 This issue has been patch via commits `7725b81` and `c903985` which are
 included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.2, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3,
 v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
 unable to upgrade should avoid cloning from untrusted URLs, especially
 recursive clones.
