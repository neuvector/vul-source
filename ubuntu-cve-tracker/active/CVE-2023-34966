Description:
 An infinite loop vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for
 Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets sent by the client,
 the core unmarshalling function sl_unpack_loop() did not validate a field
 in the network packet that contains the count of elements in an array-like
 structure. By passing 0 as the count value, the attacked function will run
 in an endless loop consuming 100% CPU. This flaw allows an attacker to
 issue a malformed RPC request, triggering an infinite loop, resulting in a
 denial of service condition.
