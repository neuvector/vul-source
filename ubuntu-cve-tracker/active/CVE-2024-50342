Description:
 symfony/http-client is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which
 provides powerful methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or
 asynchronously. When using the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, some internal
 information is still leaking during host resolution, which leads to
 possible IP/port enumeration. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the
 `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` now filters blocked IPs earlier to prevent
 such leaks. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
