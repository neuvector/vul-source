Description:
 django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based on
 user selections. In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automatically
 generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an
 integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input using
 exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. Version 2.4.0+
 applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the
 form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter`
 implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured
 validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the
 additional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if
 they are not able to upgrade.
