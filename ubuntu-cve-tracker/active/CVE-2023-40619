Description:
 phpPgAdmin 7.14.4 and earlier is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted
 data which may lead to remote code execution because user-controlled data
 is directly passed to the PHP 'unserialize()' function in multiple places.
 An example is the functionality to manage tables in 'tables.php' where the
 'ma[]' POST parameter is deserialized.
