Description:
 In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions through to
 2.4.63, an HTTP desynchronisation attack allows a man-in-the-middle
 attacker to hijack an HTTP session via a TLS upgrade.
 
 Only configurations using "SSLEngine optional" to enable TLS upgrades are
 affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which removes
 support for TLS upgrade.
