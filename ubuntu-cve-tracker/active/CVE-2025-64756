Description:
 Glob matches files using patterns the shell uses. From versions 10.3.7 to
 11.0.3, the glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its
 -c/--cmd option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing
 files with malicious names. When glob -c <command> <patterns> are used,
 matched filenames are passed to a shell with shell: true, enabling shell
 metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve
 arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges. This
 issue has been patched in version 11.1.0.
