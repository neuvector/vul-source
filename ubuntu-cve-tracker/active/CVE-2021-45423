Description:
 A Buffer Overflow vulnerabilityexists in Pev 0.81 via the pe_exports
 function from exports.c.. The array offsets_to_Names is dynamically
 allocated on the stack using exp->NumberOfFunctions as its size. However,
 the loop uses exp->NumberOfNames to iterate over it and set its components
 value. Therefore, the loop code assumes that exp->NumberOfFunctions is
 greater than ordinal at each iteration. This can lead to arbitrary code
 execution.
