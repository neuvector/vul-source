Description:
 The Debian python-rdflib-tools 4.2.2-1 package for RDFLib 4.2.2 has CLI
 tools that can load Python modules from the current working directory,
 allowing code injection, because "python -m" looks in this directory, as
 demonstrated by rdf2dot. This issue is specific to use of the
 debian/scripts directory.
