Description:
 A carefully crafted invocation on the Image plugin could trigger an CSRF
 vulnerability on Apache JSPWiki before 2.11.3, which could allow a group
 privilege escalation of the attacker's account. Further examination of this
 issue established that it could also be used to modify the email associated
 with the attacked account, and then a reset password request from the login
 page.
