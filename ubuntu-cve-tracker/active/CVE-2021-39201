Description:
 WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in
 PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue
 allows an authenticated but low-privileged user (like contributor/author)
 to execute XSS in the editor. This bypasses the restrictions imposed on
 users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches
 This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older
 versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommended
 that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References
