Description:
 As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the permissions
 of temporary files it created so that only the current user was allowed to
 access them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file and
 created a new one without said protection, effectively nullifying the
 effort. This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source files
 into the build process.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
Mitigation:
 Set the java.io.tmpdir property of the JVM to point to a directory that is not
 world read/writable.
