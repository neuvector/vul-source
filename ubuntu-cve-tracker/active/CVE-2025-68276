Description:
 Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network
 via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In 0.9-rc2 and earlier, an unprivileged
 local users can crash avahi-daemon (with wide-area disabled) by creating
 record browsers with the AVAHI_LOOKUP_USE_WIDE_AREA flag set via D-Bus.
 This can be done by either calling
 the RecordBrowserNew method directly or creating hostname/address/service
 resolvers/browsers that create those browsers internally themselves.
