Description:
 This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a running
 program using libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are met.
 libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates "easy
 handles" that are the individual handles for single transfers. libcurl
 provides a function call that duplicates en easy handle called
 [curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).
 If a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the
 cookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actual
 cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file
 on disk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file name
 as `none` (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes). Subsequent use of the
 cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies from
 would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named `none` - if such a
 file exists and is readable in the current directory of the program using
 libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.
