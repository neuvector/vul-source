Description:
 Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 NetBeans Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC)
 interpretation is vulnerable for remote command execution (RCE). Using the
 nashorn script engine the environment of the javascript execution for the
 Proxy Auto-Configuration leaks privileged objects, that can be used to
 circumvent the execution limits. If a different script engine was used, no
 execution limits were in place. Both vectors allow remote code execution.
