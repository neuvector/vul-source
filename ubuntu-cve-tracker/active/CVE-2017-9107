Description:
 An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It overruns reading a buffer
 if a domain ends with backslash. If the query domain ended with \, and
 adns_qf_quoteok_query was specified, qdparselabel would read additional
 bytes from the buffer and try to treat them as the escape sequence. It
 would depart the input buffer and start processing many bytes of arbitrary
 heap data as if it were the query domain. Eventually it would run out of
 input or find some other kind of error, and declare the query domain
 invalid. But before then it might outrun available memory and crash. In
 principle this could be a denial of service attack.
