Description:
 Due to the Asset Explorer agent not validating HTTPS certificates, an
 attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match
 the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send
 a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive
 the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent
 responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST
 payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to
 Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big.
 If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.
