Description:
 cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation of
 CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer
 overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may
 lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows
 contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption
 ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how
 and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote
 user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code
 Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the
 `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following
 cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is
 available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of
 cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability
 from being triggered.
