Description:
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
 detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
 bypass a configured file policy for HTTP.
  The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of specific HTTP header
 parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
 HTTP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
 the attacker to bypass a configured file policy for HTTP packets and
 deliver a malicious payload.
