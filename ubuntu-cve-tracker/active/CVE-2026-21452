Description:
 MessagePack for Java is a serializer implementation for Java. A
 denial-of-service vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.11 when
 deserializing .msgpack files containing EXT32 objects with
 attacker-controlled payload lengths. While MessagePack-Java parses
 extension headers lazily, it later trusts the declared EXT payload length
 when materializing the extension data. When ExtensionValue.getData() is
 invoked, the library attempts to allocate a byte array of the declared
 length without enforcing any upper bound. A malicious .msgpack file of only
 a few bytes can therefore trigger unbounded heap allocation, resulting in
 JVM heap exhaustion, process termination, or service unavailability. This
 vulnerability is triggered during model loading / deserialization, making
 it a model format vulnerability suitable for remote exploitation. The
 vulnerability enables a remote denial-of-service attack against
 applications that deserialize untrusted .msgpack model files using
 MessagePack for Java. A specially crafted but syntactically valid .msgpack
 file containing an EXT32 object with an attacker-controlled, excessively
 large payload length can trigger unbounded memory allocation during
 deserialization. When the model file is loaded, the library trusts the
 declared length metadata and attempts to allocate a byte array of that
 size, leading to rapid heap exhaustion, excessive garbage collection, or
 immediate JVM termination with an OutOfMemoryError. The attack requires no
 malformed bytes, user interaction, or elevated privileges and can be
 exploited remotely in real-world environments such as model registries,
 inference services, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-based model hosting
 platforms that accept or fetch .msgpack artifacts. Because the malicious
 file is extremely small yet valid, it can bypass basic validation and
 scanning mechanisms, resulting in complete service unavailability and
 potential cascading failures in production systems. Version 0.9.11 fixes
 the vulnerability.
