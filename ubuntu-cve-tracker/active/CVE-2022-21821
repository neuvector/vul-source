Description:
 NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit SDK contains an integer overflow vulnerability in
 cuobjdump.To exploit this vulnerability, a remote attacker would require a
 local user to download a specially crafted, corrupted file and locally
 execute cuobjdump against the file. Such an attack may lead to remote code
 execution that causes complete denial of service and an impact on data
 confidentiality and integrity.
