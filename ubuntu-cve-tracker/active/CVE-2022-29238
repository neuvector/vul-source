Description:
 Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
 computing. Prior to version 6.4.12, authenticated requests to the notebook
 server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing
 the contents of hidden directories, not accessing individual hidden files
 or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not
 'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowing
 authenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to be
 disallowed. Because fully authenticated requests are required, this is of
 relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitive
 files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh`
 while serving $HOME), then any authenticated requests could access files if
 their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access
 to the server and therefore execution permissions, which also generally
 grants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result in
 any privilege escalation or increase in information access, only an
 additional, unintended means by which the files could be accessed. Version
 6.4.12 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known
 workarounds.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> the allow-hidden feature was added in jupyter-notebook
   upstream commit 605eaa72b ("Added a flag to allow access of hidden
   files (#2819)") (version 5.3.0rc1), and as such, bionic's 5.2.x based
   version is not affected. Thanks to Luís Infante da Câmara for
   researching this.
