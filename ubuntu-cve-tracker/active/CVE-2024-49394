Description:
 In mutt and neomutt the In-Reply-To email header field is not protected by
 cryptographic signing which allows an attacker to reuse an unencrypted but
 signed email message to impersonate the original sender.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 john-breton| Mutt project does not plan to address CVE-2024-49393, 
  CVE-2024-49394, and CVE-2024-49395.
 john-breton| Given the large structural changes to NeoMutt, a fix
  for bionic is likely infeasible and not worth the effort.
Mitigation:
Bugs:
Priority: low
 This is a longstanding limitation of PGP-encrypted mail and is an
 enhancement rather than an actual vulnerability.
