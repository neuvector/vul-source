Description:
 The libcpu component which is used by libasm of elfutils version 0.177 (git
 47780c9e), suffers from denial-of-service vulnerability caused by
 application crashes due to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), off-by-one error
 (CWE-193) and reachable assertion (CWE-617); to exploit the vulnerability,
 the attackers need to craft certain ELF files which bypass the missing
 bound checks.
