 https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/commit/87119f44b9a88312dbc1f752d720bcd2371b94a8 (v2.4.12.2)
 https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/blob/v2.4.12.1/auth_openidc.conf#L975-L984
Description:
 mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified™ authentication and authorization
 module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server. Versions prior to 2.4.12.2 are
 vulnerable to Open Redirect. When providing a logout parameter to the
 redirect URI, the existing code in oidc_validate_redirect_url() does not
 properly check for URLs that start with /\t, leading to an open redirect.
 This issue has been patched in version 2.4.12.2. Users unable to upgrade
 can mitigate the issue by configuring mod_auth_openidc to only allow
 redirection when the destination matches a given regular expression with
 OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed.
