Description:
 PyMOL 2.5.0 contains a vulnerability in its "Run Script" function, which
 allows the execution of arbitrary Python code embedded within .PYM files.
 Attackers can craft a malicious .PYM file containing a Python reverse shell
 payload and exploit the function to achieve Remote Command Execution (RCE).
 This vulnerability arises because PyMOL treats .PYM files as Python scripts
 without properly validating or restricting the commands within the script,
 enabling attackers to run unauthorized commands in the context of the user
 running the application.
