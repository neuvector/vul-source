Description:
 A flaw was found in all resteasy 3.x.x versions prior to 3.12.0.Final and
 all resteasy 4.x.x versions prior to 4.6.0.Final, where an improper input
 validation results in returning an illegal header that integrates into the
 server's response. This flaw may result in an injection, which leads to
 unexpected behavior when the HTTP response is constructed.
