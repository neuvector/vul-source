Description:
 A vulnerability has been found in tcpreplay 4.5.1. This vulnerability
 affects the function mask_cidr6 of the file cidr.c of the component
 tcpprep. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack
 can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The
 exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the
 public and may be used. The researcher is able to reproduce this with the
 latest official release 4.5.1 and the current master branch. The code
 maintainer cannot reproduce this for 4.5.2-beta1. In his reply the
 maintainer explains that "[i]n that case, this is a duplicate that was
 fixed in 4.5.2."
