Description:
 Action Text brings rich text content and editing to Rails. Starting in
 version 6.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1,
 there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the
 `plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper` in Action Text. Carefully crafted
 text can cause the `plain_text_for_blockquote_node` helper to take an
 unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All
 users running an affected release should either upgrade to versions
 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch
 immediately. As a workaround, users can avoid calling
 `plain_text_for_blockquote_node` or upgrade to Ruby 3.2. Ruby 3.2 has
 mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer
 are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is
 unaffected.
