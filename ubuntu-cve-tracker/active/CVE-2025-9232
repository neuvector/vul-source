Description:
 Issue summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions
 may
 trigger an out-of-bounds read if the 'no_proxy' environment variable is set
 and
 the host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6
 address.
 
 Impact summary: An out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads to
 Denial of Service for an application.
 
 The OpenSSL HTTP client API functions can be used directly by applications
 but they are also used by the OCSP client functions and CMP (Certificate
 Management Protocol) client implementation in OpenSSL. However the URLs
 used
 by these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.
 
 In this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash.
 Furthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be
 passed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have
 a 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the
 issue was assessed as Low severity.
 
 The vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases:
 3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.
 
 The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by
 this
 issue, as the HTTP client implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module
 boundary.
