Description:
 MooTools is a collection of JavaScript utilities for JavaScript developers.
 All known versions include a CSS selector parser that is vulnerable to
 Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). An attack requires that an
 attacker can inject a string into a CSS selector at runtime, which is quite
 common with e.g. jQuery CSS selectors. No patches are available for this
 issue.
