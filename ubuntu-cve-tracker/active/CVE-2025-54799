Description:
 Let's Encrypt client and ACME library written in Go (Lego). In versions
 4.25.1 and below, the github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/acme/api package (thus the
 lego library and the lego cli as well) don't enforce HTTPS when talking to
 CAs as an ACME client. Unlike the http-01 challenge which solves an ACME
 challenge over unencrypted HTTP, the ACME protocol requires HTTPS when a
 client communicates with the CA to performs ACME functions. However, the
 library fails to enforce HTTPS both in the original discover URL
 (configured by the library user) and in the subsequent addresses returned
 by the CAs in the directory and order objects. If users input HTTP URLs or
 CAs misconfigure endpoints, protocol operations occur over HTTP instead of
 HTTPS. This compromises privacy by exposing request/response details like
 account and request identifiers to network attackers. This was fixed in
 version 4.25.2.
