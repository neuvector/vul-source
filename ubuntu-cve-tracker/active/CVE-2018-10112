Description:
 An issue was discovered in GEGL through 0.3.32. The
 gegl_tile_backend_swap_constructed function in
 buffer/gegl-tile-backend-swap.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (write access violation) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a malformed PNG file that is mishandled during a call to the
 babl_format_get_bytes_per_pixel function in babl-format.c in babl 0.1.46.
