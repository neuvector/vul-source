Description:
 A path traversal vulnerability exists in rsync. It stems from behavior
 enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many
 client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly
 enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a lack of
 proper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks occurring on
 a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the
 client's intended destination directory. A malicious server could write
 malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths
 on the client.
