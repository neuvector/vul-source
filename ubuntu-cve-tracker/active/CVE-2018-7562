Description:
 A remote code execution issue was discovered in GLPI through 9.2.1. There
 is a race condition that allows temporary access to an uploaded executable
 file that will be disallowed. The application allows an authenticated user
 to upload a file when he/she creates a new ticket via front/fileupload.php.
 This feature is protected using different types of security features like
 the check on the file's extension. However, the application uploads and
 creates a file, though this file is not allowed, and then deletes the file
 in the uploadFiles method in inc/glpiuploaderhandler.class.php.
