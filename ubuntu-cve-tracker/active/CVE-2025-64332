Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to
 versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a stack overflow that causes Suricata to crash
 can occur if SWF decompression is enabled. This issue has been patched in
 versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves disabling
 SWF decompression (swf-decompression in suricata.yaml), it is disabled by
 default; set decompress-depth to lower than half your stack size if
 swf-decompression must be enabled.
