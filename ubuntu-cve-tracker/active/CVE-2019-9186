Description:
 In several JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA versions, a Spring Boot run
 configuration with the default setting allowed remote attackers to execute
 code when the configuration is running, because a JMX server listens on all
 interfaces (instead of listening on only the localhost interface). This
 issue has been fixed in the following versions: 2019.1, 2018.3.4, 2018.2.8,
 2018.1.8, and 2017.3.7.
