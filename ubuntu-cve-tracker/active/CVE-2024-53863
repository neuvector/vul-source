Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. In Synapse versions before
 1.120.1, enabling the dynamic_thumbnails option or processing a specially
 crafted request could trigger the decoding and thumbnail generation of
 uncommon image formats, potentially invoking external tools like
 Ghostscript for processing. This significantly expands the attack surface
 in a historically vulnerable area, presenting a risk that far outweighs the
 benefit, particularly since these formats are rarely used on the open web
 or within the Matrix ecosystem. Synapse 1.120.1 addresses the issue by
 restricting thumbnail generation to images in the following widely used
 formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.120.1.
