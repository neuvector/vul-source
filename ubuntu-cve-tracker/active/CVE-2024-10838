Description:
 An integer underflow during deserialization may allow any unauthenticated
 user to read out of bounds heap memory. This may result into secret data or
 pointers revealing the layout of the address space to be included into a
 deserialized data structure, which may potentially lead to thread crashes
 or cause denial of service conditions.
