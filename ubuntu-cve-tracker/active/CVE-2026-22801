Description:
 LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create,
 and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From
 1.6.26 to 1.6.53, there is an integer truncation in the libpng simplified
 write API functions png_write_image_16bit and png_write_image_8bit causes
 heap buffer over-read when the caller provides a negative row stride (for
 bottom-up image layouts) or a stride exceeding 65535 bytes. The bug was
 introduced in libpng 1.6.26 (October 2016) by casts added to silence
 compiler warnings on 16-bit systems. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.54.
