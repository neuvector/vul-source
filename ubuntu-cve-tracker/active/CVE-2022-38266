Description:
 An issue in the Leptonica linked library (v1.79.0) allows attackers to
 cause an arithmetic exception leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) via a
 crafted JPEG file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 bruce-cable> Tesseract needs a rebuild once leptonica is patched
 john-breton> Only fix needed for tesseract is a rebuild once 
 john-breton> leptonlib is patched.
 john-breton> 
 john-breton> Only bionic and lower were built against the 
 john-breton> vulnerable version leptonlib (libtonica).
