Description:
 qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products,
 allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express application
 because an __ proto__ key can be used. In many typical Express use cases,
 an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the attack payload in the
 query string of the URL that is used to visit the application, such as
 a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000. The fix was backported to
 qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and 6.2.4 (and
 therefore Express 4.17.3, which has "deps: qs@6.9.7" in its release
 description, is not vulnerable).
