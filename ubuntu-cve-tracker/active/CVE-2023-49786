Description:
 Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit.
 In Asterisk prior to versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1; as well as
 certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6; Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS
 due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol
 when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup. This attack can be done
 continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack.
 Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on
 vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. Commit
 d7d7764cb07c8a1872804321302ef93bf62cba05 contains a fix, which is part of
 versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, 21.0.1, amd 18.9-cert6.
