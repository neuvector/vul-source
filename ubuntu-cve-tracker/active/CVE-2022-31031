Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
 STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions prior to and including 2.12.1 a stack
 buffer overflow vulnerability affects PJSIP users that use STUN in their
 applications, either by: setting a STUN server in their account/media
 config in PJSUA/PJSUA2 level, or directly using `pjlib-util/stun_simple`
 API. A patch is available in commit 450baca which should be included in the
 next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
