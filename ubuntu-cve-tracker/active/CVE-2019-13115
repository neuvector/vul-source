Description:
 In libssh2 before 1.9.0,
 kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange in kex.c has
 an integer overflow that could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way
 packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH
 server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of
 service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.
 This is related to an _libssh2_check_length mistake, and is different from
 the various issues fixed in 1.8.1, such as CVE-2019-3855.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled Diffie Hellman key
 exchange. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a
 denial of service or obtain sensitive information.
