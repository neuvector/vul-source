Description:
 Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 converts SANs
 (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format. It uses this string to
 check peer certificates against hostnames when validating connections. The
 string format was subject to an injection vulnerability when name
 constraints were used within a certificate chain, allowing the bypass of
 these name constraints.Versions of Node.js with the fix for this escape
 SANs containing the problematic characters in order to prevent the
 injection. This behavior can be reverted through the --security-revert
 command-line option.
