Description:
 Express.js minimalist web framework for node. Versions of Express.js prior
 to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected
 by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of
 Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an
 encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the
 contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause
 malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow
 list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect
 via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted
 is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.
 The vulnerability is fixed in 4.19.2 and 5.0.0-beta.3.
