Description:
 libcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE sheets.
 Versions 2.2.1 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A
 user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by downloading a cue
 sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is saved to `~/Downloads`,
 it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it has a
 .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use libcue to parse the file. The
 file exploits the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This
 issue is patched in version 2.3.0.
