Description:
 A regression in the fix for bug 66512 in Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M5, 10.1.8,
 9.0.74 and 8.5.88 meant that, if a response did not include any HTTP
 headers no AJP SEND_HEADERS messare woudl be sent for the response which in
 turn meant that at least one AJP proxy (mod_proxy_ajp) would use the
 response headers from the previous request leading to an information leak.
