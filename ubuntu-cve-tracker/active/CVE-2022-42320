Description:
 Xenstore: Guests can get access to Xenstore nodes of deleted domains Access
 rights of Xenstore nodes are per domid. When a domain is gone, there might
 be Xenstore nodes left with access rights containing the domid of the
 removed domain. This is normally no problem, as those access right entries
 will be corrected when such a node is written later. There is a small time
 window when a new domain is created, where the access rights of a past
 domain with the same domid as the new one will be regarded to be still
 valid, leading to the new domain being able to get access to a node which
 was meant to be accessible by the removed domain. For this to happen
 another domain needs to write the node before the newly created domain is
 being introduced to Xenstore by dom0.
