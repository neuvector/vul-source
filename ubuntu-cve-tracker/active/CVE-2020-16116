Description:
 In kerfuffle/jobs.cpp in KDE Ark before 20.08.0, a crafted archive can
 install files outside the extraction directory via ../ directory traversal.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Dominik Penner discovered that Ark did not properly sanitize zip
 archive files before performing extraction. An attacker could use
 this to construct a malicious zip archive that, when opened, would
 create files outside the extraction directory.
