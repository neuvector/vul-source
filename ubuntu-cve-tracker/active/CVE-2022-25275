Description:
 In some situations, the Image module does not correctly check access to
 image files not stored in the standard public files directory when
 generating derivative images using the image styles system. Access to a
 non-public file is checked only if it is stored in the "private" file
 system. However, some contributed modules provide additional file systems,
 or schemes, which may lead to this vulnerability. This vulnerability is
 mitigated by the fact that it only applies when the site sets (Drupal 9)
 $config['image.settings']['allow_insecure_derivatives'] or (Drupal 7)
 $conf['image_allow_insecure_derivatives'] to TRUE. The recommended and
 default setting is FALSE, and Drupal core does not provide a way to change
 that in the admin UI. Some sites may require configuration changes
 following this security release. Review the release notes for your Drupal
 version if you have issues accessing files or image styles after updating.
