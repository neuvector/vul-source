Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting
 (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in
 the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_
 accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time.
 The`reports_admin.php` script displays reporting information about graphs,
 devices, data sources etc. CENSUS found that an adversary that is able to
 configure a malicious Device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against
 any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the
 _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the
 device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through
 `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is
 exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a graph with
 the maliciously altered device name is linked to the report. This
 vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to
 upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.
