Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. The
 option to send a test alert is not available from the user panel UI for
 users having the Viewer role. It is still possible for a user with the
 Viewer role to send a test alert using the API as the API does not check
 access to this function. This might enable malicious users to abuse the
 functionality by sending multiple alert messages to e-mail and Slack,
 spamming users, prepare Phishing attack or block SMTP server. Users may
 upgrade to version 9.5.3, 9.4.12, 9.3.15, 9.2.19 and 8.5.26 to receive a
 fix.
