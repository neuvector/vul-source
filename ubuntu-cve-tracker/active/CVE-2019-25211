Description:
 parseWildcardRules in Gin-Gonic CORS middleware before 1.6.0 mishandles a
 wildcard at the end of an origin string, e.g., https://example.community/*
 is allowed when the intention is that only https://example.com/* should be
 allowed, and http://localhost.example.com/* is allowed when the intention
 is that only http://localhost/* should be allowed.
