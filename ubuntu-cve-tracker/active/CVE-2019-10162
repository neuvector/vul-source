Description:
 A vulnerability has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server before
 versions 4.1.10, 4.0.8 allowing an authorized user to cause the server to
 exit by inserting a crafted record in a MASTER type zone under their
 control. The issue is due to the fact that the Authoritative Server will
 exit when it runs into a parsing error while looking up the NS/A/AAAA
 records it is about to use for an outgoing notify.
