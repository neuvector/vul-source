 https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools/commit/98599df9392a346216c5a059b8d35271286100bb (5.7)
Description:
 tpm2 is the source repository for the Trusted Platform Module (TPM2.0)
 tools. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate tpm2_checkquote
 outputs by altering the TPML_PCR_SELECTION in the PCR input file.  As a
 result, digest values are incorrectly mapped to PCR slots and banks,
 providing a misleading picture of the TPM state. This issue has been
 patched in version 5.7.
