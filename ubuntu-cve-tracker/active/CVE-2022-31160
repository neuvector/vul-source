Description:
 jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects,
 widgets, and themes built on top of jQuery. Versions prior to 1.13.2 are
 potentially vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Initializing a
 checkboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes that parent
 label contents considered as the input label. Calling `.checkboxradio(
 "refresh" )` on such a widget and the initial HTML contained encoded HTML
 entities will make them erroneously get decoded. This can lead to
 potentially executing JavaScript code. The bug has been patched in jQuery
 UI 1.13.2. To remediate the issue, someone who can change the initial HTML
 can wrap all the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`.
