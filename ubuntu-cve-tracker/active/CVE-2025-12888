Description:
 Vulnerability in X25519 constant-time cryptographic implementations due to
 timing side channels introduced by compiler optimizations and CPU
 architecture limitations, specifically with the Xtensa-based ESP32 chips.
 If targeting Xtensa it is recommended to use the low memory implementations
 of X25519, which is now turned on as the default for Xtensa.
