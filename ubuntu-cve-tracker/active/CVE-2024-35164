Description:
 The terminal emulator of Apache Guacamole 1.5.5 and older does not properly
 validate console codes received from servers via text-based protocols like
 SSH. If a malicious user has access to a text-based connection, a
 specially-crafted sequence of console codes could allow arbitrary code to
 be executed
 with the privileges of the running guacd process.
 
 
 
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.0, which fixes this issue.
