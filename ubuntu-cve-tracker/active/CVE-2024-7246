Description:
 It's possible for a gRPC client communicating with a HTTP/2 proxy to poison
 the HPACK table between the proxy and the backend such that other clients
 see failed requests. It's also possible to use this vulnerability to leak
 other clients HTTP header keys, but not values.
 
 This occurs because the error status for a misencoded header is not cleared
 between header reads, resulting in subsequent (incrementally indexed) added
 headers in the first request being poisoned until cleared from the HPACK
 table.
 
 Please update to a fixed version of gRPC as soon as possible. This bug has
 been fixed in 1.58.3, 1.59.5, 1.60.2, 1.61.3, 1.62.3, 1.63.2, 1.64.3,
 1.65.4.
