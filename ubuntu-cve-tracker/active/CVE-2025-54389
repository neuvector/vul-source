Description:
 Rajesh Pangare discovered an improper output neutralization vulnerability in
 AIDE, an advanced intrusion detection system. An attacker can craft a malicious
 filename by including terminal escape sequences to hide the addition or removal
 of the file from the report and/or tamper with the log output. A local user
 might exploit this to bypass the AIDE detection of malicious files.
 Additionally the output of extended attribute key names and symbolic links
 targets are also not properly neutralized.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Rajesh Pangare discovered that AIDE incorrectly handled filenames. A local
 attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass detection of mailicious files.
