 https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html
Description:
 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows
 to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via 
 mod_rewrite or apache expressions that pass unvalidated request input.
 
 This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.0 through 2.4.63.
 
 Note:  The Apache HTTP Server Project will be setting a higher bar for
 accepting vulnerability reports regarding SSRF via UNC paths.
 
 The server offers limited protection against administrators directing the
 server to open UNC paths.
 Windows servers should limit the hosts they will connect over via SMB based
 on the nature of NTLM authentication.
