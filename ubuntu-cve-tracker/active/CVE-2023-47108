Description:
 OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for
 OpenTelemetry-Go. Prior to version 0.46.0, the grpc Unary Server
 Interceptor out of the box adds labels `net.peer.sock.addr` and
 `net.peer.sock.port` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the
 server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent.
 An attacker can easily flood the peer address and port for requests.
 Version 0.46.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround to stop being
 affected, a view removing the attributes can be used. The other possibility
 is to disable grpc metrics instrumentation by passing
 `otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider` option with `noop.NewMeterProvider`.
