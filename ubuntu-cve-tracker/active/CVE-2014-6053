Description:
 The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in libvncserver/rfbserver.c in
 LibVNCServer 0.9.9 and earlier does not properly handle attempts to send a
 large amount of ClientCutText data, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (memory consumption or daemon crash) via a crafted
 message that is processed by using a single unchecked malloc.
