Description:
 With the aid of the diagnostics_channel utility, an event can be hooked
 into whenever a worker thread is created. This is not limited only to
 workers
  but also exposes internal workers, where an instance of them can be
 fetched, and its constructor can be grabbed and reinstated for malicious
 usage.
 
 This vulnerability affects Permission Model users (--permission) on Node.js
 v20, v22, and v23.
