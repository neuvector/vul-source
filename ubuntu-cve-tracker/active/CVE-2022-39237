Description:
 syslabs/sif is the Singularity Image Format (SIF) reference implementation.
 In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity`
 package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are
 cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is
 available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to
 upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash
 algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are
 cryptographically secure.
