 https://github.com/encode/starlette/commit/fd038f3070c302bff17ef7d173dbb0b007617733 (0.40.0)
Description:
 Starlette is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI)
 framework/toolkit. Prior to version 0.40.0, Starlette treats
 `multipart/form-data` parts without a `filename` as text form fields and
 buffers those in byte strings with no size limit. This allows an attacker
 to upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow down
 significantly due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, and
 also consume more and more memory until the server starts swapping and
 grinds to a halt, or the OS terminates the server process with an OOM
 error. Uploading multiple such requests in parallel may be enough to render
 a service practically unusable, even if reasonable request size limits are
 enforced by a reverse proxy in front of Starlette. This Denial of service
 (DoS) vulnerability affects all applications built with Starlette (or
 FastAPI) accepting form requests. Verison 0.40.0 fixes this issue.
