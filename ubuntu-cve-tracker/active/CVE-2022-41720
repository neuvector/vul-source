Description:
 On Windows, restricted files can be accessed via os.DirFS and http.Dir. The
 os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of files
 rooted at a given directory. These functions permit access to Windows
 device files under that root. For example, os.DirFS("C:/tmp").Open("COM1")
 opens the COM1 device. Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only
 filesystem access. In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory
 (the root of the current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to
 escape from the drive and access any path on the system. With fix applied,
 the behavior of os.DirFS("") has changed. Previously, an empty root was
 treated equivalently to "/", so os.DirFS("").Open("tmp") would open the
 path "/tmp". This now returns an error.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
