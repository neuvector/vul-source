Description:
 ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager.
 A CSRF attack can be performed in order to delete objects (Playlist,
 smartlist etc.). Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces
 authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which
 they are currently authenticated. This vulnerability can be exploited by
 creating a malicious script with an arbitrary playlist ID belonging to
 another user. When the user submits the request, their playlist will be
 deleted. Any User with active sessions who are tricked into submitting a
 malicious request are impacted, as their playlists or other objects could
 be deleted without their consent.
