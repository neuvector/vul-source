Description:
 A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn's
 TfidfVectorizer, specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1,
 which was fixed in version 1.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the
 unexpected storage of all tokens present in the training data within the
 `stop_words_` attribute, rather than only storing the subset of tokens
 required for the TF-IDF technique to function. This behavior leads to the
 potential leakage of sensitive information, as the `stop_words_` attribute
 could contain tokens that were meant to be discarded and not stored, such
 as passwords or keys. The impact of this vulnerability varies based on the
 nature of the data being processed by the vectorizer.
