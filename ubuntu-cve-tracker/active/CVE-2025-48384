Description:
 Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
 unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and
 full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any
 trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry,
 values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when
 the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule
 path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the
 submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists
 that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the
 submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be
 unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in
 v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.
