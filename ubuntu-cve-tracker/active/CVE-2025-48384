Description:
 When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage
 return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values
 with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when
 the config is later read.  When initializing a submodule, if the
 submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read
 resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect
 location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the
 submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable
 post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed
 after checkout.
