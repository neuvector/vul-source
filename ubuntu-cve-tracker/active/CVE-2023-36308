Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** disintegration Imaging 1.6.2 allows attackers to cause a
 panic (because of an integer index out of range during a Grayscale call)
 via a crafted TIFF file to the scan function of scanner.go. NOTE: it is
 unclear whether there are common use cases in which this panic could have
 any security consequence
