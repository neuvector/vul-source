Description:
 The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains
 a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally
 this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve
 public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a
 base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the
 infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve
 parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
 certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied
 certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite
 loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can
 contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations
 include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers
 consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or
 private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification
 requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve
 parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the
 attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue.
 In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial
 parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the
 infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the
 certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can
 use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of
 the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1
 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th
 March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL
 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected
 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).
