Description:
 This affects versions of the package angular from 1.3.0. A regular
 expression used to split the value of the ng-srcset directive is vulnerable
 to super-linear runtime due to backtracking. With large carefully-crafted
 input, this can result in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of
 service. **Note:** This package is EOL and will not receive any updates to
 address this issue. Users should migrate to
 [@angular/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core).
