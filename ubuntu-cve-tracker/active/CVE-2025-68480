Description:
 Marshmallow is a lightweight library for converting complex objects to and
 from simple Python datatypes. In versions from 3.0.0rc1 to before 3.26.2
 and from 4.0.0 to before 4.1.2, Schema.load(data, many=True) is vulnerable
 to denial of service attacks. A moderately sized request can consume a
 disproportionate amount of CPU time. This issue has been patched in version
 3.26.2 and 4.1.2.
