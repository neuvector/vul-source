Description:
 The signature verification routine in Enigmail before 2.0.7 interprets user
 ids as status/control messages and does not correctly keep track of the
 status of multiple signatures, which allows remote attackers to spoof
 arbitrary email signatures via public keys containing crafted primary user
 ids.
