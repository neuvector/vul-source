Description:
 GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc
 Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In
 GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability within the document
 upload function (Home > Management > Documents > Add, or
 /front/document.form.php endpoint), indeed one of the form field: "Web
 Link" is not properly sanitized and a malicious user (who has document
 upload rights) can use it to deliver JavaScript payload. For example if you
 use the following payload: " accesskey="x" onclick="alert(1)" x=", the
 content will be saved within the database without any control. And then
 once you return to the summary documents page, by clicking on the "Web
 Link" of the newly created file it will create a new empty tab, but on the
 initial tab the pop-up "1" will appear.
