Description:
 A vulnerability was detected in Kamailio 5.5. The affected element is the
 function sr_push_yy_state of the file src/core/cfg.lex of the component
 Configuration File Handler. The manipulation results in use after free. The
 attack must be initiated from a local position. The exploit is now public
 and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted
 at the moment. This attack requires manipulating config files which might
 not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was contacted early
 about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.
