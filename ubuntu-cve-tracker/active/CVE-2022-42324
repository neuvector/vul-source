Description:
 Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or
 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t
 out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml
 builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most
 significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the
 remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting
 a negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The
 unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying
 (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.
