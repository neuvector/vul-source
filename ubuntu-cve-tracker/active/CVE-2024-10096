Description:
 Dask versions <=2024.8.2 contain a vulnerability in the Dask Distributed
 Server where the use of pickle serialization allows attackers to craft
 malicious objects. These objects can be serialized on the client side and
 sent to the server for deserialization, leading to remote command execution
 and potentially granting full control over the Dask server.
