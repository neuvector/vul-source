Description:
 A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle
 signature verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the
 Elliptic Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply function being called with
 out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting in incorrect results. This flaw
 allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing an assertion
 failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is
 to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
