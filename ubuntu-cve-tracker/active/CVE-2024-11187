Description:
 It is possible to construct a zone such that some queries to it will
 generate responses containing numerous records in the Additional section.
 An attacker sending many such queries can cause either the authoritative
 server itself or an independent resolver to use disproportionate resources
 processing the queries. Zones will usually need to have been deliberately
 crafted to attack this exposure.
 This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.11.37, 9.16.0 through
 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.32, 9.20.0 through 9.20.4, 9.21.0 through
 9.21.3, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, and
 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.32-S1.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> in focal and jammy, isc-dhcp uses the bind9-libs package
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
