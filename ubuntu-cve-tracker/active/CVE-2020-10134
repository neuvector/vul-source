Description:
 Pairing in BluetoothÂ® Core v5.2 and earlier may permit an unauthenticated
 attacker to acquire credentials with two pairing devices via adjacent
 access when the unauthenticated user initiates different pairing methods in
 each peer device and an end-user erroneously completes both pairing
 procedures with the MITM using the confirmation number of one peer as the
 passkey of the other. An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker could be able
 to initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device exposed by
 the enabled Bluetooth profiles. This exposure may be limited when the user
 must authorize certain access explicitly, but so long as a user assumes
 that it is the intended remote device requesting permissions, device-local
 protections may be weakened.
