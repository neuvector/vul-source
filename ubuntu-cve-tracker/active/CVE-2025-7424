Description:
 A flaw was found in the libxslt library. The same memory field, psvi, is
 used for both stylesheet and input data, which can lead to type confusion
 during XML transformations. This vulnerability allows an attacker to crash
 the application or corrupt memory. In some cases, it may lead to denial of
 service or unexpected behavior.
