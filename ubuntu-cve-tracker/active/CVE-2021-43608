Description:
 Doctrine DBAL 3.x before 3.1.4 allows SQL Injection. The escaping of offset
 and length inputs to the generation of a LIMIT clause was not probably cast
 to an integer, allowing SQL injection to take place if application
 developers passed unescaped user input to the DBAL QueryBuilder or any
 other API that ultimately uses the AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery API.
