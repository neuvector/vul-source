Description:
 Versions of the package follow-redirects before 1.15.4 are vulnerable to
 Improper Input Validation due to the improper handling of URLs by the
 url.parse() function. When new URL() throws an error, it can be manipulated
 to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit this weakness to
 redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information
 disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.
