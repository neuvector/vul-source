Description:
 editorconfig-core-c  is  theEditorConfig core library written in C (for use
 by plugins supporting EditorConfig parsing). In affected versions several
 overflows may occur in switch case '[' when the input pattern contains many
 escaped characters. The added backslashes leave too little space in the
 output pattern when processing nested brackets such that the remaining
 input length exceeds the output capacity. This issue has been addressed in
 release version 0.12.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
