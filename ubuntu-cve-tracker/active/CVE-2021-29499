Description:
 SIF is an open source implementation of the Singularity Container Image
 Format. The `siftool new` command and func siftool.New() produce
 predictable UUID identifiers due to insecure randomness in the version of
 the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` module used as a dependency. A patch is
 available in version >= v1.2.3 of the module. Users are encouraged to
 upgrade. As a workaround, users passing CreateInfo struct should ensure the
 `ID` field is generated using a version of `github.com/satori/go.uuid` that
 is not vulnerable to this issue.
