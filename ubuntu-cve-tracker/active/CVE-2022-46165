Description:
 Syncthing is an open source, continuous file synchronization program. In
 versions prior to 1.23.5 a compromised instance with shared folders could
 sync malicious files which contain arbitrary HTML and JavaScript in the
 name. If the owner of another device looks over the shared folder settings
 and moves the mouse over the latest sync, a script could be executed to
 change settings for shared folders or add devices automatically.
 Additionally adding a new device with a malicious name could embed HTML or
 JavaScript inside parts of the page. As a result the webUI may be subject
 to a stored cross site scripting attack. This issue has been addressed in
 version 1.23.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
 should avoid sharing folders with untrusted users.
