Description:
 go-gh is a collection of Go modules to make authoring GitHub CLI extensions
 easier. A security vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to
 2.12.1 where an attacker-controlled GitHub Enterprise Server could result
 in executing arbitrary commands on a user's machine by replacing HTTP URLs
 provided by GitHub with local file paths for browsing. In `2.12.1`,
 `Browser.Browse()` has been enhanced to allow and disallow a variety of
 scenarios to avoid opening or executing files on the filesystem without
 unduly impacting HTTP URLs. No known workarounds are available other than
 upgrading.
