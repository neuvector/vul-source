 https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/4629
Description:
 wolfSSL through 5.0.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and
 infinite loop in the client component by sending crafted traffic from a
 Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) position. The root cause is that the client
 module accepts TLS messages that normally are only sent to TLS servers.
