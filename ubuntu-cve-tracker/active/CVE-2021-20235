Description:
 There's a flaw in the zeromq server in versions before 4.3.3 in
 src/decoder_allocators.hpp. The decoder static allocator could have its
 sized changed, but the buffer would remain the same as it is a static
 buffer. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who sends a crafted request to
 the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data
 if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact of this
 flaw is to application availability, data integrity, and confidentiality.
