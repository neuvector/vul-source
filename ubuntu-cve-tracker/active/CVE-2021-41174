Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In
 affected versions if an attacker is able to convince a victim to visit a
 URL referencing a vulnerable page, arbitrary JavaScript content may be
 executed within the context of the victim's browser. The user visiting the
 malicious link must be unauthenticated and the link must be for a page that
 contains the login button in the menu bar. The url has to be crafted to
 exploit AngularJS rendering and contain the interpolation binding for
 AngularJS expressions. AngularJS uses double curly braces for interpolation
 binding: {{ }} ex: {{constructor.constructor(‘alert(1)’)()}}. When the user
 follows the link and the page renders, the login button will contain the
 original link with a query parameter to force a redirect to the login page.
 The URL is not validated and the AngularJS rendering engine will execute
 the JavaScript expression contained in the URL. Users are advised to
 upgrade as soon as possible. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can
 use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to block the literal string
 {{ in the path.
