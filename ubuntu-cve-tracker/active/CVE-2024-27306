Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. A XSS vulnerability exists on index pages for static file handling.
 This vulnerability is fixed in 3.9.4. We have always recommended using a
 reverse proxy server (e.g. nginx) for serving static files. Users following
 the recommendation are unaffected. Other users can disable `show_index` if
 unable to upgrade.
