Description:
 Kea configuration and API directives can be used to overwrite arbitrary
 files, subject to permissions granted to Kea.  Many common configurations
 run Kea as root, leave the API entry points unsecured by default, and/or
 place the control sockets in insecure paths.
 This issue affects Kea versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.1, 2.6.0 through 2.6.2,
 and 2.7.0 through 2.7.8.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> The changes in the new version are massive and restrict
 mdeslaur> configuration and data files to a specific directory set at
 mdeslaur> build time. This may introduce a regression in stable releases
 mdeslaur> depending on how existing installations are configured.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> On Debian and Ubuntu on noble+, the daemons are run as non-root,
 mdeslaur> and are protected by AppArmor. These hardening measures
 mdeslaur> mitigate this vulnerability.
 mdeslaur> In addition, access to the RESTful API is restricted to
 mdeslaur> authenticated users.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> AppArmor profile was introduced in (2.2.0-3) (noble+)
 mdeslaur> RESTful API restriction was introduced in (2.2.0-8) (noble+)
