Description:
 A vulnerability exists in CakePHP versions 4.0.x through 4.1.3. The
 CsrfProtectionMiddleware component allows method override parameters to
 bypass CSRF checks by changing the HTTP request method to an arbitrary
 string that is not in the list of request methods that CakePHP checks.
 Additionally, the route middleware does not verify that this overriden
 method (which can be an arbitrary string) is actually an HTTP method.
