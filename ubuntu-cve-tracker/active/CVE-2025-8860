Description:
 When the guest writes to register UEFI_VARS_REG_BUFFER_SIZE, the .write
 callback `uefi_vars_write` is invoked. The function allocates a
 heap buffer without zeroing the memory, leaving the buffer filled with
 residual data from prior allocations. When the guest later reads from
 register UEFI_VARS_REG_PIO_BUFFER_TRANSFER, the .read callback
 `uefi_vars_read` returns leftover metadata or other sensitive process
 memory from the previously allocated buffer, leading to an information
 disclosure vulnerability.
