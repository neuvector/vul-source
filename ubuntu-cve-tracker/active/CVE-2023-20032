Description:
 On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library
 was disclosed: A vulnerability in the HFS+ partition file parser of ClamAV
 versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier
 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
 This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may result in
 a heap buffer overflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
 by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an
 affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
 arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV scanning process, or else
 crash the process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. For a
 description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog
 ["https://blog.clamav.net/"].
