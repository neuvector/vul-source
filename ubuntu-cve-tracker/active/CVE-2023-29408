Description:
 The TIFF decoder does not place a limit on the size of compressed tile
 data. A maliciously-crafted image can exploit this to cause a small image
 (both in terms of pixel width/height, and encoded size) to make the decoder
 decode large amounts of compressed data, consuming excessive memory and
 CPU.
