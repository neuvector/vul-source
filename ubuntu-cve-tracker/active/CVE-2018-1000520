Description:
 ARM mbedTLS version 2.7.0 and earlier contains a Ciphersuite Allows
 Incorrectly Signed Certificates vulnerability in
 mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() that can result in ECDSA-signed
 certificates are accepted, when only RSA-signed ones should be.. This
 attack appear to be exploitable via Peers negotiate a TLS-ECDH-RSA-*
 ciphersuite. Any of the peers can then provide an ECDSA-signed certificate,
 when only an RSA-signed one should be accepted..
