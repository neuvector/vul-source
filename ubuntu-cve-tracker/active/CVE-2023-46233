Description:
 crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version
 4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in
 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard.
 This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm
 considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single
 iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when
 specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to
 preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is
 high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0
 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to
 use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.
