Description:
 jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Improper
 cross-site credential checks on `/files/` URLs could allow exposure of
 certain file contents, or accessing files when opening untrusted files via
 "Open image in new tab". This issue has been addressed in commit
 `87a49272728` which has been included in release `2.7.2`. Users are advised
 to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use the lower performance
 `--ContentsManager.files_handler_class=jupyter_server.files.handlers.FilesHandler`,
 which implements the correct checks.
