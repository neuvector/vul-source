Description:
 An attacker spoofing answers to ECS enabled requests sent out by the
 Recursor has a chance of success higher than non-ECS enabled queries.
 
 The updated version include various mitigations against spoofing attempts
 of ECS enabled queries by chaining ECS enabled requests and enforcing
 stricter validation of the received answers.
 
 The most strict mitigation done when the new setting
 outgoing.edns_subnet_harden (old style name edns-subnet-harden) is enabled.
