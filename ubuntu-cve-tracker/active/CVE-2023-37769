Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Whilst the CVE description mentions the stress-test binary
  (which is only part of the test suite in pixman and itself is not
  distributed in Ubuntu) it is not clear if this is a bug in the underlying
  library code itself or just in stress-test
 mdeslaur> New comment in upstream bug does suggest this issue is in the
  test binary
 leosilva> as of 2024-06-11, there is no upstream fix available for this
  issue
