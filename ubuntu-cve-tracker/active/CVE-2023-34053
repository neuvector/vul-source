Description:
 In Spring Framework versions 6.0.0 - 6.0.13, it is possible for a user to
 provide specially crafted HTTP requests that may cause a denial-of-service
 (DoS) condition. Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the
 following are true: * the application uses Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux *
 io.micrometer:micrometer-core is on the classpath * an ObservationRegistry
 is configured in the application to record observations Typically, Spring
 Boot applications need the org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-actuator
 dependency to meet all conditions.
