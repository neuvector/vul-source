Description:
 When starting Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2, configured with the
 SaslZkACLProvider or VMParamsAllAndReadonlyDigestZkACLProvider and no
 existing security.json znode, if the optional read-only user is configured
 then Solr would not treat that node as a sensitive path and would allow it
 to be readable. Additionally, with any ZkACLProvider, if the security.json
 is already present, Solr will not automatically update the ACLs.
