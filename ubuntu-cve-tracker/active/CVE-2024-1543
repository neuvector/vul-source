Description:
 The side-channel protected T-Table implementation in wolfSSL up to version
 5.6.5 protects against a side-channel attacker with cache-line resolution.
 In a controlled environment such as Intel SGX, an attacker can gain a per
 instruction sub-cache-line resolution allowing them to break the
 cache-line-level protection. For details on the attack refer to:
