Description:
 An issue was discovered in KDE KMail before 19.12.3. By using the
 proprietary (non-RFC6068) "mailto?attach=..." parameter, a website (or
 other source of mailto links) can make KMail attach local files to a
 composed email message without showing a warning to the user, as
 demonstrated by an attach=.bash_history value.
