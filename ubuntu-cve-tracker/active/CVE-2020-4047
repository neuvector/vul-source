Description:
 In affected versions of WordPress, authenticated users with upload
 permissions (like authors) are able to inject JavaScript into some media
 file attachment pages in a certain way. This can lead to script execution
 in the context of a higher privileged user when the file is viewed by them.
 This has been patched in version 5.4.2, along with all the previously
 affected versions via a minor release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10, 4.9.15,
 4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19, 4.5.22, 4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28, 4.1.31, 4.0.31,
 3.9.32, 3.8.34, 3.7.34).
