Description:
 A flaw was discovered in libvirt in the XML file processing. More
 specifically, the parsing of user provided XML files was performed before
 the ACL checks. A malicious user with limited permissions could exploit
 this flaw by submitting a specially crafted XML file, causing libvirt to
 allocate too much memory on the host. The excessive memory consumption
 could lead to a libvirt process crash on the host, resulting in a
 denial-of-service condition.
