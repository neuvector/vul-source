Description:
 LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and its related
 bits and pieces. In versions 0.5.50 and below, there is a traffic-induced
 memory leak that can starve the process of memory, leading to loss of
 visibility. To workaround this issue, set `suricata.yaml
 app-layer.protocols.http.libhtp.default-config.lzma-enabled` to false. This
 issue is fixed in version 0.5.51.
