Description:
 Temporary data passed between application components by Budgie Extras
 Takeabreak applet could potentially be viewed or manipulated. The data is
 stored in a location that is accessible to any user who has local access to
 the system. Attackers may pre-create and control this file to present false
 information to users or deny access to the application and panel.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Matthias Gerstner discovered that the Takeabreak application of Budgie
 Extras used predictable temporary file paths which are world editable. An
 attacker could use this to inject false information, read information, or
 deny access to the application.
