Description:
 A flaw was found in the 389-ds-base LDAP Server. This issue occurs when
 issuing a Modify DN LDAP operation through the ldap protocol, when the
 function return value is not tested and a NULL pointer is dereferenced. If
 a privileged user performs a ldap MODDN operation after a failed operation,
 it could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or system crash.
