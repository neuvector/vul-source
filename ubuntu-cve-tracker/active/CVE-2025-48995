Description:
 SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python.
 When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and
 HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False,
 hmac_key=...`), versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a
 potential timing attack. The verifier may leak information about the
 correct HMAC when comparing it with the user supplied hash, allowing users
 to reconstruct the correct HMAC for any data.
