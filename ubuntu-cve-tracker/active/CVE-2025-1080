Description:
 LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser integration of
 LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme
 'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to LibreOffice was added. In the
 affected versions of LibreOffice a link in a browser using that scheme
 could be constructed with an embedded inner URL that when passed to
 LibreOffice could call internal macros with arbitrary arguments.
 This issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.8 before < 24.8.5, from 25.2 before
 < 25.2.1.
