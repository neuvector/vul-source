Description:
 Kaminari is a paginator for web app frameworks and object relational
 mappings. A security vulnerability involving insecure file permissions has
 been identified in the Kaminari pagination library for Ruby on Rails,
 concerning insecure file permissions. This vulnerability is of moderate
 severity due to the potential for unauthorized write access to particular
 Ruby files managed by the library. Such access could lead to the alteration
 of application behavior or data integrity issues. Users of affected
 versions are advised to update to Kaminari version 0.16.2 or later, where
 file permissions have been adjusted to enhance security. If upgrading is
 not feasible immediately, review and adjust the file permissions for
 particular Ruby files in Kaminari to ensure they are only accessible by
 authorized user.
