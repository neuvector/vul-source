Description:
 sqclass.cpp in Squirrel through 2.2.5 and 3.x through 3.1 allows an
 out-of-bounds read (in the core interpreter) that can lead to Code
 Execution. If a victim executes an attacker-controlled squirrel script, it
 is possible for the attacker to break out of the squirrel script sandbox
 even if all dangerous functionality such as File System functions has been
 disabled. An attacker might abuse this bug to target (for example) Cloud
 services that allow customization via SquirrelScripts, or distribute
 malware through video games that embed a Squirrel Engine.
