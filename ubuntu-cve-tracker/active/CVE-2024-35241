Description:
 Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. On the 2.x branch prior to
 versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7, the `status`, `reinstall` and `remove` commands
 with packages installed from source via git containing specially crafted
 branch names in the repository can be used to execute code. Patches for
 this issue are available in version 2.2.24 for 2.2 LTS or 2.7.7 for
 mainline. As a workaround, avoid installing dependencies via git by using
 `--prefer-dist` or the `preferred-install: dist` config setting.
