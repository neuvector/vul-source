Description:
 GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in
 version 0.84 and prior to versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7, usage of RSS feeds is
 subject to server-side request forgery (SSRF). In case the remote address
 is not a valid RSS feed, an RSS autodiscovery feature is triggered. This
 feature does not check safety or URLs. Versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7 contain a
 patch for this issue.
