Description:
 hyper is an HTTP library for Rust. In versions prior to 0.14.10, hyper's
 HTTP server and client code had a flaw that could trigger an integer
 overflow when decoding chunk sizes that are too big. This allows possible
 data loss, or if combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that allows chunk
 sizes larger than hyper does, can result in "request smuggling" or "desync
 attacks." The vulnerability is patched in version 0.14.10. Two possible
 workarounds exist. One may reject requests manually that contain a
 `Transfer-Encoding` header or ensure any upstream proxy rejects
 `Transfer-Encoding` chunk sizes greater than what fits in 64-bit unsigned
 integers.
