Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when a file is moved using atomic_move
 primitive as the file mode cannot be specified. This sets the destination
 files world-readable if the destination file does not exist and if the file
 exists, the file could be changed to have less restrictive permissions
 before the move. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data. All
 versions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.
