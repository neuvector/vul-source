Description:
 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in
 Apache Tomcat.Â  When using PreResources or PostResources mounted other than
 at the root of the web application, it was possible to access those
 resources via an unexpected path. That path was likely not to be protected
 by the same security constraints as the expected path, allowing those
 security constraints to be bypassed.
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106,
 which fix the issue.
