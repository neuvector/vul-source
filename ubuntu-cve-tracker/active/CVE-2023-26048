Description:
 Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versions
 servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`)
 that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or
 `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the
 client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no
 filename and very large content. This happens even with the default
 settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part
 content to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request and
 cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server may be
 able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service --
 although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions
 9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
 upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set
 to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited
 (although still read into memory).
