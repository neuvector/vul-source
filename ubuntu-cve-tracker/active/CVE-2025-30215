Description:
 NATS-Server is a High-Performance server for NATS.io, the cloud and edge
 native messaging system. In versions starting from 2.2.0 but prior to
 2.10.27 and 2.11.1, the management of JetStream assets happens with
 messages in the $JS. subject namespace in the system account; this is
 partially exposed into regular accounts to allow account holders to manage
 their assets. Some of the JS API requests were missing access controls,
 allowing any user with JS management permissions in any account to perform
 certain administrative actions on any JS asset in any other account. At
 least one of the unprotected APIs allows for data destruction. None of the
 affected APIs allow disclosing stream contents. This vulnerability is fixed
 in v2.11.1 or v2.10.27.
