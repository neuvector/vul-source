Description:
 x86: unintended memory sharing between guests On Intel systems that support
 the "virtualize APIC accesses" feature, a guest can read and write the
 global shared xAPIC page by moving the local APIC out of xAPIC mode. Access
 to this shared page bypasses the expected isolation that should exist
 between two guests.
