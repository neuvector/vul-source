Description:
 Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1
 allows remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against
 servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided data,
 because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java
 serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT
 serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what
 a client has sent and whether the data size is reasonable.
