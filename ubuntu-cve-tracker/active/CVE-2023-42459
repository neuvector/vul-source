Description:
 Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service)
 standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). In affected versions
 specific DATA submessages can be sent to a discovery locator which may
 trigger a free error. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. The
 call to free() could potentially leave the pointer in the attackers control
 which could lead to a double free. This issue has been addressed in
 versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade.
 There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
