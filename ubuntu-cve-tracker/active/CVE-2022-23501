Description:
 TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In
 versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is
 vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to
 specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be
 bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get
 access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the
 adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS,
 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.
