 https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-106749
Description:
 MongoDB Server may be susceptible to stack overflow due to JSON parsing
 mechanism, where specifically crafted JSON inputs may induce unwarranted
 levels of recursion, resulting in excessive stack space consumption. Such
 inputs can lead to a stack overflow that causes the server to crash which
 could occur pre-authorisation. This issue affects MongoDB Server v7.0
 versions prior to 7.0.17 and MongoDB Server v8.0 versions prior to 8.0.5.
 
 The same issue affects MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior to 6.0.21, but an
 attacker can only induce denial of service after authenticating.
