Description:
 Starlette is a lightweight ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)
 framework/toolkit, designed for building async web services in Python. In
 versions 0.47.1 and below, when parsing a multi-part form with large files
 (greater than the default max spool size) starlette will block the main
 thread to roll the file over to disk. This blocks the event thread which
 means the application can't accept new connections. The UploadFile code has
 a minor bug where instead of just checking for self._in_memory, the logic
 should also check if the additional bytes will cause a rollover. The
 vulnerability is fixed in version 0.47.2.
