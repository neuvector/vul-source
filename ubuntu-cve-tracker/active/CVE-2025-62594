Description:
 ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap
 images. ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-8 are vulnerable to
 denial-of-service due to unsigned integer underflow and division-by-zero in
 the CLAHEImage function. When tile width or height is zero, unsigned
 underflow occurs in pointer arithmetic, leading to out-of-bounds memory
 access, and division-by-zero causes immediate crashes. This issue has been
 patched in version 7.1.2-8.
