Description:
 The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body
 bypass to sequentially exfiltrate small and undetectable sections of data
 by repeatedly submitting an HTTP Range header field with a small byte
 range. A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected,
 may be exfiltrated from the backend, despite being protected by a web
 application firewall that uses CRS. Short subsections of a restricted
 resource may bypass pattern matching techniques and allow undetected
 access. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as
 the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are
 advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRS
 paranoia level of 3 or higher.
