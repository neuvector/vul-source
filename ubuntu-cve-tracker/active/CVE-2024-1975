 DNSSEC-validates a "KEY" Resource Record from a DNSSEC-signed domain in
 cache, a client can exhaust resolver CPU resources by sending a stream of
 SIG(0) signed requests.

Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> in focal and jammy, isc-dhcp uses the bind9-libs package
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
