Description:
 Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Vim
 allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to
 register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of
 registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting
 the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content
 before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the
 `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the
 content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a
 use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that
 it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at
 the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not
 check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard
 registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back
 to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip
 outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard
 registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
