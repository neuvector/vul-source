Description:
 GIMP FLI File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of FLI files. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result
 in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage
 this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
 Was ZDI-CAN-25100.
