Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In
 versions 8.2.0 and above, a user can run the XACKDEL command with multiple
 ID's and trigger a stack buffer overflow, which may potentially lead to
 remote code execution. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.3. To workaround
 this issue without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users
 from executing XACKDEL operation. This can be done using ACL to restrict
 XACKDEL command.
