Description:
 Line directives ("//line") can be used to bypass the restrictions on
 "//go:cgo_" directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to be
 passed during compilation. This can result in unexpected execution of
 arbitrary code when running "go build". The line directive requires the
 absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which makes
 exploiting this issue significantly more complex.
