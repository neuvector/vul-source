Description:
 radsecproxy is a generic RADIUS proxy that supports both UDP and TLS
 (RadSec) RADIUS transports. Missing input validation in radsecproxy's
 `naptr-eduroam.sh` and `radsec-dynsrv.sh` scripts can lead to configuration
 injection via crafted radsec peer discovery DNS records. Users are subject
 to Information disclosure, Denial of Service, Redirection of Radius
 connection to a non-authenticated server leading to non-authenticated
 network access. Updated example scripts are available in the master branch
 and 1.9 release. Note that the scripts are not part of the installation
 package and are not updated automatically. If you are using the examples,
 you have to update them manually. The dyndisc scripts work independently of
 the radsecproxy code. The updated scripts can be used with any version of
 radsecproxy.
