Description:
 On Linux the sccache client can execute arbitrary code with the privileges
 of a local sccache server, by preloading the code in a shared library
 passed to LD_PRELOAD.
 
 
 If the server is run as root (which is the default when installing the
 snap package https://snapcraft.io/sccache ), this means a user running the
 sccache client can get root privileges.
