Description:
 GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell
 metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c
 uses the system C library function in its implementation of the ctags
 program. For example, a victim may use the "ctags *" command (suggested in
 the ctags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory
 has contents that depend on untrusted input.
