Description:
 html-sanitizer is an allowlist-based HTML cleaner. If using
 `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer
 normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters
 normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape
 sanitization. The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.
