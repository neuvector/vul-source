Description:
 An out-of-bounds heap buffer access issue was found in the ARM Generic
 Interrupt Controller emulator of QEMU up to and including qemu 4.2.0on
 aarch64 platform. The issue occurs because while writing an interrupt ID to
 the controller memory area, it is not masked to be 4 bits wide. It may lead
 to the said issue while updating controller state fields and their
 subsequent processing. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to crash
 the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.
