Description:
 A race condition flaw was found in Ansible Engine 2.7.17 and prior, 2.8.9
 and prior, 2.9.6 and prior when running a playbook with an unprivileged
 become user. When Ansible needs to run a module with become user, the
 temporary directory is created in /var/tmp. This directory is created with
 "umask 77 && mkdir -p <dir>"; this operation does not fail if the directory
 already exists and is owned by another user. An attacker could take
 advantage to gain control of the become user as the target directory can be
 retrieved by iterating '/proc/<pid>/cmdline'.
