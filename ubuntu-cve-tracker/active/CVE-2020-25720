Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Samba where a delegated administrator with
 permission to create objects in Active Directory can write to all
 attributes of the newly created object, including security-sensitive
 attributes, even after the object's creation. This issue occurs because the
 administrator owns the object due to the lack of an Access Control List
 (ACL) at the time of creation and later being recognized as the 'creator
 owner.' The retained significant rights of the delegated administrator may
 not be well understood, potentially leading to unintended privilege
 escalation or security risks.
