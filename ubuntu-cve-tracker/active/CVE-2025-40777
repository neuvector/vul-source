Description:
 If a `named` caching resolver is configured with `serve-stale-enable`
 `yes`, and with `stale-answer-client-timeout` set to `0` (the only
 allowable value other than `disabled`), and if the resolver, in the process
 of resolving a query, encounters a CNAME chain involving a specific
 combination of cached or authoritative records, the daemon will abort with
 an assertion failure.
 This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.20.0 through 9.20.10, 9.21.0 through
 9.21.9, and 9.20.9-S1 through 9.20.10-S1.
