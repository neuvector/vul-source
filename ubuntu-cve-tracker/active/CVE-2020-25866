Description:
 In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.6 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.13, the BLIP protocol
 dissector has a NULL pointer dereference because a buffer was sized for
 compressed (not uncompressed) messages. This was addressed in
 epan/dissectors/packet-blip.c by allowing reasonable compression ratios and
 rejecting ZIP bombs.
