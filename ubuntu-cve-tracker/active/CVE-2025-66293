Description:
 LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create,
 and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. Prior to
 1.6.52, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in libpng's simplified API
 allows reading up to 1012 bytes beyond the png_sRGB_base[512] array when
 processing valid palette PNG images with partial transparency and gamma
 correction. The PNG files that trigger this vulnerability are valid per the
 PNG specification; the bug is in libpng's internal state management.
 Upgrade to libpng 1.6.52 or later.
