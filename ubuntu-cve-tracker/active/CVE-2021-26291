Description:
 Apache Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependencyâ€™s
 Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting
 in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that repository or is
 able to insert themselves into a position to pretend to be that repository.
 Maven is changing the default behavior in 3.8.1+ to no longer follow http
 (non-SSL) repository references by default. More details available in the
 referenced urls. If you are currently using a repository manager to govern
 the repositories used by your builds, you are unaffected by the risks
 present in the legacy behavior, and are unaffected by this vulnerability
 and change to default behavior. See this link for more information about
 repository management: https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html
