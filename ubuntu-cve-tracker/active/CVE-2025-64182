Description:
 OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR
 file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In
 versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.4, 3.3.0 through 3.3.5, and 3.4.0 through 3.4.2,
 a memory safety bug in the legacy OpenEXR Python adapter (the deprecated
 OpenEXR.InputFile wrapper) allow crashes and likely code execution when
 opening attacker-controlled EXR files or when passing crafted Python
 objects. Integer overflow and unchecked allocation in InputFile.channel()
 and InputFile.channels() can lead to heap overflow (32 bit) or a NULL deref
 (64 bit). Versions 3.2.5, 3.3.6, and 3.4.3 contain a patch for the issue.
