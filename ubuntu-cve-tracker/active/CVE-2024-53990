Description:
 The AsyncHttpClient (AHC) library allows Java applications to easily
 execute HTTP requests and asynchronously process HTTP responses. When
 making any HTTP request, the automatically enabled and self-managed
 CookieStore (aka cookie jar) will silently replace explicitly defined
 Cookies with any that have the same name from the cookie jar. For services
 that operate with multiple users, this can result in one user's Cookie
 being used for another user's requests.
