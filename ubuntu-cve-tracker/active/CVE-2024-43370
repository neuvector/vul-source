Description:
 gettext.js is a GNU gettext port for node and the browser. There is a
 cross-site scripting (XSS) injection if `.po` dictionary definition files
 are corrupted. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.0.3. As a
 workaround, control the origin of the definition catalog to prevent the use
 of this flaw in the definition of plural forms.
