Description:
 The NSS code used for checking PKCS#1 v1.5 was leaking information useful
 in mounting Bleichenbacher-like attacks. Both the overall correctness of
 the padding as well as the length of the encrypted message was leaking
 through timing side-channel. By sending large number of attacker-selected
 ciphertexts, the attacker would be able to decrypt a previously intercepted
 PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext (for example, to decrypt a TLS session that used RSA
 key exchange), or forge a signature using the victim's key. The issue was
 fixed by implementing the implicit rejection algorithm, in which the NSS
 returns a deterministic random message in case invalid padding is detected,
 as proposed in the Marvin Attack paper. This vulnerability affects NSS <
 3.61.
