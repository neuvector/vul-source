Description:
 In all versions of AppArmor mount rules are accidentally widened when
 compiled.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that the AppArmor policy compiler incorrectly
 generated looser restrictions than expected for rules allowing mount
 operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass AppArmor
 restrictions in applications where some mount operations were
 permitted.
Notes: 
 sbeattie> apparmor policies that do not grant the ability to perform
  any mount permissions are not affected.
 alexmurray> Original fix introduced a regression, requiring the fix from
  https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/merge_requests/1048 as well
 sbeattie> additional regression fix in
  https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/merge_requests/1054
