Description:
 Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Prior to versions
 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1, Jetty accepts the `+` character
 proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field.  This is more
 permissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such
 requests with 400 responses.  There is no known exploit scenario, but it is
 conceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in
 combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending
 such a 400 response. Versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1 contain
 a patch for this issue. There is no workaround as there is no known exploit
 scenario.
