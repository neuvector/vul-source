Description:
 The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not
 properly sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause the
 Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or
 otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of
 "setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt" will be sent as a file named "setup.bat". If the
 FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted
 source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a
 name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can
 modify the Content-Disposition header.
