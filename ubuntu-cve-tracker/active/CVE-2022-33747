Description:
 Arm: unbounded memory consumption for 2nd-level page tables Certain actions
 require e.g. removing pages from a guest's P2M (Physical-to-Machine)
 mapping. When large pages are in use to map guest pages in the 2nd-stage
 page tables, such a removal operation may incur a memory allocation (to
 replace a large mapping with individual smaller ones). These memory
 allocations are taken from the global memory pool. A malicious guest might
 be able to cause the global memory pool to be exhausted by manipulating its
 own P2M mappings.
