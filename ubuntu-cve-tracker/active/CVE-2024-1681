Description:
 corydolphin/flask-cors is vulnerable to log injection when the log level is
 set to debug. An attacker can inject fake log entries into the log file by
 sending a specially crafted GET request containing a CRLF sequence in the
 request path. This vulnerability allows attackers to corrupt log files,
 potentially covering tracks of other attacks, confusing log post-processing
 tools, and forging log entries. The issue is due to improper output
 neutralization for logs.
