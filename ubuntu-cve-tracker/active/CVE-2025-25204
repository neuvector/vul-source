Description:
 `gh` is GitHubâ€™s official command line tool. Starting in version 2.49.0 and
 prior to version 2.67.0, under certain conditions, a bug in GitHub's
 Artifact Attestation cli tool `gh attestation verify` causes it to return a
 zero exit status when no attestations are present. This behavior is
 incorrect: When no attestations are present, `gh attestation verify` should
 return a non-zero exit status code, thereby signaling verification failure.
 An attacker can abuse this flaw to, for example, deploy malicious artifacts
 in any system that uses `gh attestation verify`'s exit codes to gatekeep
 deployments. Users are advised to update `gh` to patched version `v2.67.0`
 as soon as possible.
