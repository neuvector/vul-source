Description:
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI
 specification. In versions 1.2.7 and below, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.1,
 1.4.0-rc.1 and 1.4.0-rc.2 files, runc would not perform sufficient
 verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container's
 /dev/null) was actually a real /dev/null inode when using the container's
 /dev/null to mask. This exposes two methods of attack:  an arbitrary mount
 gadget, leading to host information disclosure, host denial of service,
 container escape, or a bypassing of maskedPaths. This issue is fixed in
 versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.
