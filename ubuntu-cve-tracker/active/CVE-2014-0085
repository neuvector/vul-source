Description:
 JBoss Fuse did not enable encrypted passwords by default in its usage of
 Apache Zookeeper. This permitted sensitive information disclosure via
 logging to local users. Note: this description has been updated; previous
 text mistakenly identified the source of the flaw as Zookeeper. Previous
 text: Apache Zookeeper logs cleartext admin passwords, which allows local
 users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log.
