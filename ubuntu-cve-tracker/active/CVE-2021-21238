Description:
 PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2
 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature
 vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML
 documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature
 wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML
 schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a
 document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in
 PySAML2 6.5.0.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Fixing this requires the python-xmlschema package, which is
 mdeslaur> only available on hirsute. Backporting this fix to stable
 mdeslaur> releases is intrusive and may introduce regressions.
