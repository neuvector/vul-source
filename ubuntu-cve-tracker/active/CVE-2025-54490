Description:
 A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing
 functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch
 (35a819fa). A specially crafted MFER file can lead to arbitrary code
 execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this
 vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 9090 of biosig.c on the
 current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 64:
 
                 else if (tag==64)     //0x40
                 {
                     // preamble
                     char tmp[256];  // [1]
                     curPos += ifread(tmp,1,len,hdr);
 
 In this case, the overflowed buffer is the newly-declared `tmp` \[1\]
 instead of `buf`. While `tmp` is larger than `buf`, having a size of 256
 bytes, a stack overflow can still occur in cases where `len` is encoded
 using multiple octets and is greater than 256.
