Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Buildah. Cache mounts do not properly validate
 that user-specified paths for the cache are within our cache directory,
 allowing a `RUN` instruction in a Container file to mount an arbitrary
 directory from the host (read/write) into the container as long as those
 files can be accessed by the user running Buildah.
