Description:
 An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the Grassroots DICOM library
 (GDCM). The issue is triggered during parsing of a malformed DICOM file
 containing encapsulated PixelData fragments (compressed image data stored
 as multiple fragments). This vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault
 caused by an out-of-bounds memory access due to unsigned integer underflow
 in buffer indexing. It is exploitable via file input, simply opening a
 crafted malicious DICOM file is sufficient to trigger the crash, resulting
 in a denial-of-service condition.
