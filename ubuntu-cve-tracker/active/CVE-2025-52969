Description:
 ClickHouse 25.7.1.557 allows low-privileged users to execute shell commands
 by querying existing Executable() tables created by higher-privileged
 users. Although the CREATE TABLE privilege is restricted, there is no
 access control preventing low-privileged users from invoking Executable
 tables already present in the system. If an attacker can influence the
 contents of the script referenced by the Executable() engine through
 writable paths, they may execute controlled commands in the context of the
 ClickHouse server, leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized code
 execution. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that these types of executions
 by low-privileged users are the expected behavior.
