Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This CVE is for the use of a DSA key to sign the upstream

 mdeslaur> https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/hplipDigitalCertificate.html
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> In the hplip-data binary package, the DSA key is located in
 mdeslaur> /usr/share/hplip/signing-key.asc and is loaded by
 mdeslaur> /usr/share/hplip/base/validation.py. We need to investigate
