Description:
 An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the QuickJS regular expression
 engine (libregexp) due to an inconsistent representation of the bytecode
 buffer size.
 
   *  The regular expression bytecode is stored in a DynBuf structure, which
 correctly uses a $\text{size}\_\text{t}$ (an unsigned type, typically
 64-bit) for its size member.
 
 
   *  However, several functions, such as re_emit_op_u32 and other internal
 parsing routines, incorrectly cast or store this DynBuf
 $\text{size}\_\text{t}$ value into a signed int (typically 32-bit).
 
 
   *  When a large or complex regular expression (such as those generated by
 a recursive pattern in a Proof-of-Concept) causes the bytecode size to
 exceed $2^{31}$ bytes (the maximum positive value for a signed 32-bit
 integer), the size value wraps around, resulting in a negative integer when
 stored in the int variable (Integer Overflow).
 
 
   *  This negative value is subsequently used in offset calculations. For
 example, within functions like re_parse_disjunction, the negative size is
 used to compute an offset (pos) for patching a jump instruction.
 
 
   *  This negative offset is then incorrectly added to the buffer pointer
 (s->byte\_code.buf + pos), leading to an out-of-bounds write on the first
 line of the snippet below:
 
 put_u32(s->byte_code.buf + pos, len);
