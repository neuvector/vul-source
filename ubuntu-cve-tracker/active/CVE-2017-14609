Description:
 The server daemons in Kannel 1.5.0 and earlier create a PID file after
 dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to
 kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for
 PID file modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat
 /pathname`" command, as demonstrated by bearerbox.
