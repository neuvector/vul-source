Description:
 spimsimulator spim v9.1.24 and before is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in
 the READ_SYSCALL and WRITE_SYSCALL system calls. The application verifies
 the legitimacy of the starting and ending addresses for memory read/write
 operations. By configuring the starting and ending addresses for memory
 read/write to point to distinct memory segments within the virtual machine,
 it is possible to circumvent these checks.
