Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in the GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)
 component. This flaw occurs because the bootloader mishandles string
 conversion when reading information from a USB device, allowing an attacker
 to exploit inconsistent length values. A local attacker can connect a
 maliciously configured USB device during the boot sequence to trigger this
 issue. A successful exploitation may lead GRUB to crash, leading to a
 Denial of Service. Data corruption may be also possible, although given the
 complexity of the exploit the impact is most likely limited.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
