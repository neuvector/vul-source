Description:
 A stack overflow via an infinite recursion vulnerability was found in the
 eepro100 i8255x device emulator of QEMU. This issue occurs while processing
 controller commands due to a DMA reentry issue. This flaw allows a guest
 user or process to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the
 host, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to system availability.
