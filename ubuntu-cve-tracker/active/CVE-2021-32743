Description:
 Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network
 resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for
 reporting. In versions prior to 2.11.10 and from version 2.12.0 through
 version 2.12.4, some of the Icinga 2 features that require credentials for
 external services expose those credentials through the API to authenticated
 API users with read permissions for the corresponding object types.
 IdoMysqlConnection and IdoPgsqlConnection (every released version) exposes
 the password of the user used to connect to the database. IcingaDB (added
 in 2.12.0) exposes the password used to connect to the Redis server.
 ElasticsearchWriter (added in 2.8.0)exposes the password used to connect to
 the Elasticsearch server. An attacker who obtains these credentials can
 impersonate Icinga to these services and add, modify and delete information
 there. If credentials with more permissions are in use, this increases the
 impact accordingly. Starting with the 2.11.10 and 2.12.5 releases, these
 passwords are no longer exposed via the API. As a workaround, API user
 permissions can be restricted to not allow querying of any affected
 objects, either by explicitly listing only the required object types for
 object query permissions, or by applying a filter rule.
