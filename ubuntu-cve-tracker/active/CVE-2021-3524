Description:
 A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway)
 in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection
 of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the
 ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header
 injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the
 prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \r as a
 header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Sergey Bobrov discovered that Ceph's RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway)
 allowed the injection of HTTP headers in responses to CORS
 requests. An attacker could use this to violate system integrity.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> this is fixed in 16.2.4 in hirsute-updates but has not been
 mdeslaur> pushed to the security pocket
