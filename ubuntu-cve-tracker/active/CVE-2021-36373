Description:
 When reading a specially crafted TAR archive an Apache Ant build can be
 made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out of
 memory error, even for small inputs. This can be used to disrupt builds
 using Apache Ant. Apache Ant prior to 1.9.16 and 1.10.11 were affected.
