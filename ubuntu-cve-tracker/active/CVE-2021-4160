Description:
 There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring
 procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3
 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the
 pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing
 private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a
 result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
 believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although
 very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information
 about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources
 required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on
 TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key
 among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.
 This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was
 addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021.
 For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is
 available to premium support customers only. It will be made available in
 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS
 platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m
 (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected
 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).
