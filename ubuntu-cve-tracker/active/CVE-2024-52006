Description:
 Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
 unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and
 full access to internals. Git defines a line-based protocol that is used to
 exchange information between Git and Git credential helpers. Some
 ecosystems (most notably, .NET and node.js) interpret single Carriage
 Return characters as newlines, which renders the protections against
 CVE-2020-5260 incomplete for credential helpers that treat Carriage Returns
 in this way. This issue has been addressed in commit `b01b9b8` which is
 included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.2, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3,
 v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
 unable to upgrade should avoid cloning from untrusted URLs, especially
 recursive clones.
