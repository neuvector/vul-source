Description:
 The keras.utils.get_file API in Keras, when used with the extract=True
 option for tar archives, is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The
 utility uses Python's tarfile.extractall function without the filter="data"
 feature. A remote attacker can craft a malicious tar archive containing
 special symlinks, which, when extracted, allows them to write arbitrary
 files to any location on the filesystem outside of the intended destination
 folder. This vulnerability is linked to the underlying Python tarfile
 weakness, identified as CVE-2025-4517. Note that upgrading Python to one of
 the versions that fix CVE-2025-4517 (e.g. Python 3.13.4) is not enough. One
 additionally needs to upgrade Keras to a version with the fix (Keras 3.12).
