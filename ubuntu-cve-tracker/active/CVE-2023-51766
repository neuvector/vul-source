Description:
 Exim before 4.97.1 allows SMTP smuggling in certain PIPELINING/CHUNKING
 configurations. Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique
 to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass
 of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because Exim supports
 <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular e-mail servers do not.
