Description:
 Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner, a
 tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Prior to version
 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle
 file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()`
 function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files.
 These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution
 stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an
 alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in
 `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which
 will automatically execute when the PDF is processed. Version 20251107
 fixes the issue.
