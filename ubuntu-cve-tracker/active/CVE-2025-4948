Description:
 A flaw was found in the soup_multipart_new_from_message() function of the
 libsoup HTTP library, which is commonly used by GNOME and other
 applications to handle web communications. The issue occurs when the
 library processes specially crafted multipart messages. Due to improper
 validation, an internal calculation can go wrong, leading to an integer
 underflow. This can cause the program to access invalid memory and crash.
 As a result, any application or server using libsoup could be forced to
 exit unexpectedly, creating a denial-of-service (DoS) risk.
