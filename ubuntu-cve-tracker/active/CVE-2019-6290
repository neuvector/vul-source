Description:
 An infinite recursion issue was discovered in eval.c in Netwide Assembler
 (NASM) through 2.14.02. There is a stack exhaustion problem resulting from
 infinite recursion in the functions expr, rexp, bexpr and cexpr in certain
 scenarios involving lots of '{' characters. Remote attackers could leverage
 this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted asm file.
