Description:
 CISOfy Lynis before 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control because of a TOCTOU
 race condition. The routine to check the log and report file permissions
 was not working as intended and could be bypassed locally. Because of the
 race, an unprivileged attacker can set up a log and report file, and
 control that up to the point where the specific routine is doing its check.
 After that, the file can be removed, recreated, and used for additional
 attacks.
