Description:
 When using a TarFile.errorlevel = 0 and extracting with a filter the
 documented behavior is that any filtered members would be skipped and not
 extracted. However the actual behavior of TarFile.errorlevel = 0 in
 affected versions is that the member would still be extracted and not
 skipped.
