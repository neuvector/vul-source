Description:
 When using a TarFile.errorlevel = 0 and extracting with a filter the
 documented behavior is that any filtered members would be skipped and not
 extracted. However the actual behavior of TarFile.errorlevel = 0 in
 affected versions is that the member would still be extracted and not
 skipped.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 hlibk> The tarfile filter feature was introduced in Python version 3.12
  and subsequently backported to older versions. Older releases are not
  affected as the feature was never backported for the Ubuntu releases. For
  example, in Python 3.9, the tarfile filter feature was introduced in
  version 3.9.17. This can be checked in the Lib/shutil.py file whether the
  _unpack_tarfile function has a filter parameter. Relevant commit is
  98016f7c92aa4c1232c68bac1ed6646db31782ec for 3.9.17.
