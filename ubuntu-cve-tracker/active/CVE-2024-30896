Description:
 InfluxDB OSS 2.x through 2.7.11 stores the administrative operator token
 under the default organization which allows authorized users with read
 access to the authorization resource of the default organization to
 retrieve the operator token. InfluxDB OSS 1.x, Enterprise, Cloud, Cloud
 Dedicated and Clustered are not affected. NOTE: The researcher states that
 InfluxDB allows allAccess administrators to retrieve all raw tokens via an
 "influx auth ls" command. The supplier indicates that the organizations
 feature is operating as intended and that users may choose to add users to
 non-default organizations. A future release of InfluxDB 2.x will remove the
 ability to retrieve tokens from the API.
