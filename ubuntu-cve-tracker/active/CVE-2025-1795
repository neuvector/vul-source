 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7570-1
Description:
 During an address list folding when a separating comma ends up on a folded
 line and that line is to be unicode-encoded then the separator itself is
 also unicode-encoded. Expected behavior is that the separating comma
 remains a plan comma. This can result in the address header being
 misinterpreted by some mail servers.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> The initial commit for this issue caused a regression and was
 mdeslaur> subsequently fixed.
 hlibk> The folding code in python3.5 and below has changed significantly which
  makes backporting the regression fix risky.
