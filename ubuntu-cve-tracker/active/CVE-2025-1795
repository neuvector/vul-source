Description:
 During an address list folding when a separating comma ends up on a folded
 line and that line is to be unicode-encoded then the separator itself is
 also unicode-encoded. Expected behavior is that the separating comma
 remains a plan comma. This can result in the address header being
 misinterpreted by some mail servers.
