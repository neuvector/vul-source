Description:
 rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails
 applications. Certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer < 1.4.4 use an
 inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive
 backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may
 lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue
 has been patched in version 1.4.4.
