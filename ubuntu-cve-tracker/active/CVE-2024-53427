Description:
 decNumberCopy in decNumber.c in jq through 1.7.1 does not properly consider
 that NaN is interpreted as numeric, which has a resultant stack-based
 buffer overflow and out-of-bounds write, as demonstrated by use of --slurp
 with subtraction, such as a filter of .-. when the input has a certain form
 of digit string with NaN (e.g., "1 NaN123" immediately followed by many
 more digits).
