Description:
 Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for
 performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security
 Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard
 library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following
 (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged
 program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise
 access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this
 vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build
 targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are
 thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version
 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1
 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run
 in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as
 those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding
 checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the
 vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like
 remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended
 outside of race conditions.

Notes:
 alexmurray| Will require any package in the Ubuntu archive which calls
  remove_dir_all() to be recompiled with the patched rustc
