Description:
 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is an open source web frontend for managing
 entries stored in an LDAP directory. The profile editor tool has an edit
 profile functionality, the parameters on this page are not properly
 sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An authenticated user can
 store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets triggered when any other
 user try to access the edit profile page. The pdf editor tool has an edit
 pdf profile functionality, the logoFile parameter in it is not properly
 sanitized and an user can enter relative paths like
 ../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png
 via tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited
 profile the pdf icon has the image on that path(if image is present). Both
 issues require an attacker to be able to login to LAM admin interface. The
 issue is fixed in version 7.9.1.
