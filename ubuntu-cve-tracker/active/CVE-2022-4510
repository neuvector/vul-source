Description:
 A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from
 version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS
 filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract
 files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e
 option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem
 that, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the
 folder .config/binwalk/plugins. This vulnerability is associated with
 program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py. This issue affects binwalk from
 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.
