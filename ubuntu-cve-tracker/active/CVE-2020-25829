Description:
 An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.1.18, 4.2.x before
 4.2.5, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5. A remote attacker can cause the cached
 records for a given name to be updated to the Bogus DNSSEC validation
 state, instead of their actual DNSSEC Secure state, via a DNS ANY query.
 This results in a denial of service for installation that always validate
 (dnssec=validate), and for clients requesting validation when on-demand
 validation is enabled (dnssec=process).
