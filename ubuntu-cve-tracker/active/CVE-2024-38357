Description:
 TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s content parsing code. This
 allowed specially crafted noscript elements containing malicious code to be
 executed when that content was loaded into the editor. This vulnerability
 has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by
 ensuring that content within noscript elements are properly parsed. Users
 are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
