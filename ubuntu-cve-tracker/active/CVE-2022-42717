Description:
 An issue was discovered in Hashicorp Packer before 2.3.1. The recommended
 sudoers configuration for Vagrant on Linux is insecure. If the host has
 been configured according to this documentation, non-privileged users on
 the host can leverage a wildcard in the sudoers configuration to execute
 arbitrary commands as root.
