Description:
 aes-gcm is a pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM. In
 decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted ciphertext (which is the correct
 ciphertext) is exposed even if the tag is incorrect. This is because in
 decrypt_inplace in asconcore.rs, tag verification causes an error to be
 returned with the plaintext contents still in buffer. The vulnerability is
 fixed in 0.4.3.
