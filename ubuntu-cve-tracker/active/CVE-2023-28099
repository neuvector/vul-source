Description:
 OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
 Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, if `ds_is_in_list()` is used with an
 invalid IP address string (`NULL` is illegal input), OpenSIPS will attempt
 to print a string from a random address (stack garbage), which could lead
 to a crash. All users of `ds_is_in_list()` without the `$si` variable as
 1st parameter could be affected by this vulnerability to a larger, lesser
 or no extent at all, depending if the data passed to the function is a
 valid IPv4 or IPv6 address string or not. Fixes will are available starting
 with the 3.1.9 and 3.2.6 minor releases. There are no known workarounds.
