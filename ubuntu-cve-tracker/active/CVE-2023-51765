Description:
 sendmail through 8.17.2 allows SMTP smuggling in certain configurations.
 Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject
 e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF
 protection mechanism. This occurs because sendmail supports <LF>.<CR><LF>
 but some other popular e-mail servers do not. This is resolved in 8.18 and
 later versions with 'o' in srv_features.
