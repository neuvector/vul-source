Description:
 h2 is a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocol stack. Prior to
 version 4.3.0, an HTTP/2 request splitting vulnerability allows attackers
 to perform request smuggling attacks by injecting CRLF characters into
 headers. This occurs when servers downgrade HTTP/2 requests to HTTP/1.1
 without properly validating header names/values, enabling attackers to
 manipulate request boundaries and bypass security controls. This issue has
 been patched in version 4.3.0.
