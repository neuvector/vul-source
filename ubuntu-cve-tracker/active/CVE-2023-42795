Description:
 Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.When recycling various
 internal objects in Apache Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.80 and from 8.5.0
 through 8.5.93, an error could
 cause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process leading to
 information leaking from the current request/response to the next.
 Older, EOL versions mayÂ also be affected.
 
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14
 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue.
