Description:
 A vulnerability was found in OpenSC, OpenSC tools, PKCS#11 module,
 minidriver, and CTK. An attacker could use a crafted USB Device or Smart
 Card, which would present the system with a specially crafted response to
 APDUs.

 APDU buffer and its length when communicating with the card.
