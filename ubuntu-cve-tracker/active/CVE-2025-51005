Description:
 A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the tcpliveplay utility of
 the tcpreplay-4.5.1. When a crafted pcap file is processed, the program
 incorrectly handles memory in the checksum calculation logic at
 do_checksum_math_liveplay in tcpliveplay.c, leading to a possible denial of
 service.
