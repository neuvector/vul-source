Description:
 Protobuf-c v1.4.0 was discovered to contain an invalid arithmetic shift via
 the function parse_tag_and_wiretype in protobuf-c/protobuf-c.c. This
 vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via
 unspecified vectors.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> pidgin in precise+ uses embedded libgadu
 alexmurray| The various Ubuntu source packages listed against this CVE all
  contain an embedded copy of protobuf-c but they still needed to be triaged
  to determine if they actually use their own embedded copy or whether they
  link against the system libprotobuf-c
 mdeslaur> in sudo, only used by sudo_logsrvd, setting priority to low
 eslerm> sudo is patched and they sent PR to protobuf-c upstream
