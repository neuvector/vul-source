Description:
 In PowerDNS Authoritative Server before 4.4.3, 4.5.x before 4.5.4, and
 4.6.x before 4.6.1 and PowerDNS Recursor before 4.4.8, 4.5.x before 4.5.8,
 and 4.6.x before 4.6.1, insufficient validation of an IXFR end condition
 causes incomplete zone transfers to be handled as successful transfers.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 hlibk> On xenial, the ixfrInProgress variable is not present, which seems
 hlibk> to be related to the patch, among other features. It is unclear
 hlibk> whether the code is vulnerable or not, and whether introducing
 hlibk> these features would introduce the vulnerability as well. Upstream
 hlibk> no longer supports the xenial version.
