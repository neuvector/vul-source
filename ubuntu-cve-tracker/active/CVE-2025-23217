Description:
 mitmproxy is a interactive TLS-capable intercepting HTTP proxy for
 penetration testers and software developers and mitmweb is a web-based
 interface for mitmproxy. In mitmweb 11.1.1 and below, a malicious client
 can use mitmweb's proxy server (bound to `*:8080` by default) to access
 mitmweb's internal API (bound to `127.0.0.1:8081` by default). In other
 words, while the cannot access the API directly, they can access the API
 through the proxy. An attacker may be able to escalate this SSRF-style
 access to remote code execution. The mitmproxy and mitmdump tools are
 unaffected. Only mitmweb is affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in
 mitmproxy 11.1.2 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this vulnerability.
