Description:
 When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, the read method of Apache
 Commons Compress 1.7 to 1.17's ZipArchiveInputStream can fail to return the
 correct EOF indication after the end of the stream has been reached. When
 combined with a java.io.InputStreamReader this can lead to an infinite
 stream, which can be used to mount a denial of service attack against
 services that use Compress' zip package.
