Description:
 OpenSearch is an open source distributed and RESTful search engine. In
 affected versions there is an issue in the implementation of field-level
 security (FLS) and field masking where rules written to explicitly exclude
 fields are not correctly applied for certain queries that rely on their
 auto-generated .keyword fields. This issue is only present for
 authenticated users with read access to the indexes containing the
 restricted fields. This may expose data which may otherwise not be
 accessible to the user. OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1 are
 affected. Users are advised to upgrade to OpenSearch 1.3.8 or 2.5.0. Users
 unable to upgrade may write explicit exclusion rules as a workaround.
 Policies authored in this way are not subject to this issue.
