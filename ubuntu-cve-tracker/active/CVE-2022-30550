Description:
 An issue was discovered in the auth component in Dovecot 2.2 and 2.3 before
 2.3.20. When two passdb configuration entries exist with the same driver
 and args settings, incorrect username_filter and mechanism settings can be
 applied to passdb definitions. These incorrectly applied settings can lead
 to an unintended security configuration and can permit privilege escalation
 in certain configurations. The documentation does not advise against the
 use of passdb definitions that have the same driver and args settings. One
 such configuration would be where an administrator wishes to use the same
 PAM configuration or passwd file for both normal and master users but use
 the username_filter setting to restrict which of the users is able to be a
 master user.
