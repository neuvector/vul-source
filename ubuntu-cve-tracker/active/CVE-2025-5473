Description:
 GIMP ICO File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
 affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is required to exploit
 this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
 malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of ICO files. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result
 in an integer overflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage
 this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
 Was ZDI-CAN-26752.
