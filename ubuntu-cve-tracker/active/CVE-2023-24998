Description:
 Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.5 does not limit the number of request
 parts to be processed resulting in the possibility of an attacker
 triggering a DoS with a malicious upload or series of uploads. Note that,
 like all of the file upload limits, the new configuration option
 (FileUploadBase#setFileCountMax) is not enabled by default and must be
 explicitly configured.
