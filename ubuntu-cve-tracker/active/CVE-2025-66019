Description:
 pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version
 6.4.0, an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads
 to a memory usage of up to 1 GB per stream. This requires parsing the
 content stream of a page using the LZWDecode filter. This issue has been
 patched in version 6.4.0.
