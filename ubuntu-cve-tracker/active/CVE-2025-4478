Description:
 A flaw was found in the gnome-remote-desktop used by Anaconda's remote
 install feature, where a crafted RDP packet could trigger a segmentation
 fault. This issue causes the service to crash and remain defunct, resulting
 in a denial of service. It occurs pre-boot and is likely due to a NULL
 pointer dereference. Rebooting is required to recover the system.
