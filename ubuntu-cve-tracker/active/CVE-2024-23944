Description:
 Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeper
 due to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by
 attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the
 attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when
 the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of
 znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of
 the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this
 vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain
 sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially
 critical.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the
 issue.
