Description:
 Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager.
 The current implementation of token parsing does not adequately validate
 CSRF tokens when users delete messages. This vulnerability could be
 exploited to forge CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to delete messages to
 any user, including administrators, if they interact with a malicious
 request. This issue has been addressed in version 7.0.1 and all users are
 advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
