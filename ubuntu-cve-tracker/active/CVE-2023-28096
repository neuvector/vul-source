Description:
 OpenSIPS, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation, has a
 memory leak starting in the 2.3 branch and priot to versions 3.1.8 and
 3.2.5. The memory leak was detected in the function `parse_mi_request`
 while performing coverage-guided fuzzing. This issue can be reproduced by
 sending multiple requests of the form `{"jsonrpc": "2.0","method":
 "log_le`. This malformed message was tested against an instance of OpenSIPS
 via FIFO transport layer and was found to increase the memory consumption
 over time. To abuse this memory leak, attackers need to reach the
 management interface (MI) which typically should only be exposed on trusted
 interfaces. In cases where the MI is exposed to the internet without
 authentication, abuse of this issue will lead to memory exhaustion which
 may affect the underlying system’s availability. No authentication is
 typically required to reproduce this issue. On the other hand, memory leaks
 may occur in other areas of OpenSIPS where the cJSON library is used for
 parsing JSON objects. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.
