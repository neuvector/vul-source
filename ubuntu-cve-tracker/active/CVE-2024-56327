Description:
 pyrage is a set of Python bindings for the rage file encryption library
 (age in Rust). `pyrage` uses the Rust `age` crate for its underlying
 operations, and `age` is vulnerable to GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w. All details of
 GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w are relevant to `pyrage` for the versions specified in
 this advisory. See GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w for full details. Versions of
 `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are therefore **not
 affected**. An equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go
 implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory
 GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3 and all
 users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
