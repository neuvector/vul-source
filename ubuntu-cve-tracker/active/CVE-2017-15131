Description:
 It was found that system umask policy is not being honored when creating
 XDG user directories, since Xsession sources xdg-user-dirs.sh before
 setting umask policy. This only affects xdg-user-dirs before 0.15.5 as
 shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> This feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of Unix model to
  assume that every task run on behalf of a user will be started as a child
  process of bash or sh run as an interactive or login shell.
 seth-arnold> Environments that want a specific umask set for users should use
  the pam_umask(8) module as part of the login process.
 seth-arnold> Environments that need a specific umask set for compliance reasons
  should investigate the feasibility of preparing a single-purpose LSM or
  seccomp jail interface of some sort.
 rodrigo-zaiden> pam_umask is being used to set umask when an interactive
  session is started, so Ubuntu is not affected by this CVE.
