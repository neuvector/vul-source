Description:
 An issue was discovered in Teluu pjproject (pjlib and pjlib-util) in PJSIP
 before 2.7.1. The ioqueue component may issue a double key unregistration
 after an attacker initiates a socket connection with specific settings and
 sequences. Such double key unregistration will trigger an integer overflow,
 which may cause ioqueue backends to reject future key registrations.
