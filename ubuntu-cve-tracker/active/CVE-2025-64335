Description:
 Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open
 Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In versions
 from 8.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a NULL dereference can occur when the entropy
 keyword is used in conjunction with base64_data. This issue has been
 patched in version 8.0.2. A workaround involves disabling rules that use
 entropy in conjunction with base64_data.
