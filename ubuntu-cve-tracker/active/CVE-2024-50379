Description:
 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability during JSP
 compilation in Apache Tomcat permits an RCE on case insensitive file
 systems when the default servlet is enabled for write (non-default
 configuration).
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.
 
 The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are
 known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may
 also be affected.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.2, 10.1.34 or 9.0.98,
 which fixes the issue.
