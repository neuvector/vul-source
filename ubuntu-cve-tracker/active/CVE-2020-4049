Description:
 In affected versions of WordPress, when uploading themes, the name of the
 theme folder can be crafted in a way that could lead to JavaScript
 execution in /wp-admin on the themes page. This does require an admin to
 upload the theme, and is low severity self-XSS. This has been patched in
 version 5.4.2, along with all the previously affected versions via a minor
 release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10, 4.9.15, 4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19,
 4.5.22, 4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28, 4.1.31, 4.0.31, 3.9.32, 3.8.34, 3.7.34).
