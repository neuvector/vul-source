Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Affected versions are subject to a cross site request forgery vulnerability
 which allows attackers to elevate their privileges by mounting cross-origin
 attacks against authenticated high-privilege Grafana users (for example,
 Editors or Admins). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability for
 privilege escalation by tricking an authenticated user into inviting the
 attacker as a new user with high privileges. Users are advised to upgrade
 as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
