Description:
 In Django 3.2 before 3.2.19, 4.x before 4.1.9, and 4.2 before 4.2.1, it was
 possible to bypass validation when using one form field to upload multiple
 files. This multiple upload has never been supported by forms.FileField or
 forms.ImageField (only the last uploaded file was validated). However,
 Django's "Uploading multiple files" documentation suggested otherwise.
