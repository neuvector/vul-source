Description:
 CKEditor 5 is a modern JavaScript rich-text editor with an MVC
 architecture. During a recent internal audit, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
 vulnerability was discovered in the CKEditor 5 real-time collaboration
 package. This vulnerability affects user markers, which represent users'
 positions within the document. It can lead to unauthorized JavaScript code
 execution, which might happen with a very specific editor and token
 endpoint configuration. This vulnerability affects only installations with
 Real-time collaborative editing enabled. The problem has been recognized
 and patched. The fix is available in version 44.2.1 (and above). Users are
 advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
