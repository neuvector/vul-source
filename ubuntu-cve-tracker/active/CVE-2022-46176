Description:
 Cargo is a Rust package manager. The Rust Security Response WG was notified
 that Cargo did not perform SSH host key verification when cloning indexes
 and dependencies via SSH. An attacker could exploit this to perform
 man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This vulnerability has been assigned
 CVE-2022-46176. All Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 are
 vulnerable. Note that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternate
 registry indexes or crate dependencies, you might be affected by this
 vulnerability if you have configured git to replace HTTPS connections to
 GitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), as
 that'd cause you to clone the crates.io index through SSH. Rust 1.66.1 will
 ensure Cargo checks the SSH host key and abort the connection if the
 server's public key is not already trusted. We recommend everyone to
 upgrade as soon as possible.
