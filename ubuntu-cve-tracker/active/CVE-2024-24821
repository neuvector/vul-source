Description:
 Composer is a dependency Manager for the PHP language. In affected versions
 several files within the local working directory are included during the
 invocation of Composer and in the context of the executing user. As such,
 under certain conditions arbitrary code execution may lead to local
 privilege escalation, provide lateral user movement or malicious code
 execution when Composer is invoked within a directory with tampered files.
 All Composer CLI commands are affected, including composer.phar's
 self-update. The following scenarios are of high risk: Composer being run
 with sudo, Pipelines which may execute Composer on untrusted projects,
 Shared environments with developers who run Composer individually on the
 same project. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 2.7.0 and
 2.2.23. It is advised that the patched versions are applied at the earliest
 convenience. Where not possible, the following should be addressed: Remove
 all sudo composer privileges for all users to mitigate root privilege
 escalation, and avoid running Composer within an untrusted directory, or if
 needed, verify that the contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php`
 and `vendor/composer/installed.php` do not include untrusted code. A reset
 can also be done on these files by the following:```sh rm
 vendor/composer/installed.php vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php
 composer install --no-scripts --no-plugins ```
