Description:
 Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a
 vulnerability starting in version 4.1.91.Final and prior to version
 4.1.118.Final. When a special crafted packet is received via SslHandler it
 doesn't correctly handle validation of such a packet in all cases which can
 lead to a native crash. Version 4.1.118.Final contains a patch. As
 workaround its possible to either disable the usage of the native SSLEngine
 or change the code manually.
