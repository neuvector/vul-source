Description:
 An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was discovered in
 SOGo Webmail thru 5.6.0, allowing an authenticated user to send emails on
 behalf of other users by manipulating a user-controlled identifier in the
 email-sending request. The server fails to verify whether the authenticated
 user is authorized to use the specified sender identity, resulting in
 unauthorized message delivery as another user. This can lead to
 impersonation, phishing, or unauthorized communication within the system.
 NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the only effective way to
 prevent this sender spoofing is on the SMTP server, not within a client
 such as SOGo.
