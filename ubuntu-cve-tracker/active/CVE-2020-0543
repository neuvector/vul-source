Description:
 Incomplete cleanup from specific special register read operations in some
 Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
 information disclosure via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that memory contents previously stored in
 microarchitectural special registers after RDRAND, RDSEED, and SGX EGETKEY
 read operations on Intel client and Xeon E3 processors may be briefly
 exposed to processes on the same or different processor cores. A local
 attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.
Notes:
