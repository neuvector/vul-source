Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse versions before 1.106
 are vulnerable to a disk fill attack, where an unauthenticated adversary
 can induce Synapse to download and cache large amounts of remote media. The
 default rate limit strategy is insufficient to mitigate this. This can lead
 to a denial of service, ranging from further media uploads/downloads
 failing to completely unavailability of the Synapse process, depending on
 how Synapse was deployed. Synapse 1.106 introduces a new "leaky bucket"
 rate limit on remote media downloads to reduce the amount of data a user
 can request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but does
 limit an unauthenticated user's ability to request large amounts of data to
 be cached.
