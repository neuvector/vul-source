Description:
 GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in
 version 10.0.0 and prior to version 10.0.7, GLPI inventory endpoint can be
 used to drive a SQL injection attack. It can also be used to store

 inventory endpoint requires no authentication. Version 10.0.7 contains a
 patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable native inventory.
