Description:
 uap-core in an open-source npm package which contains the core of
 BrowserScope's original user agent string parser. In uap-core before
 version 0.11.0, some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of
 service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote
 attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an
 HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings. This is fixed in
 version 0.11.0. Downstream packages such as uap-python, uap-ruby etc which
 depend upon uap-core follow different version schemes.
