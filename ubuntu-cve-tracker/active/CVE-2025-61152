 https://pypi.org/project/python-jose
Description:
 python-jose thru 3.3.0 allows JWT tokens with 'alg=none' to be decoded and
 accepted without any cryptographic signature verification. A malicious
 actor can craft a forged token with arbitrary claims (e.g., is_admin=true)
 and bypass authentication checks, leading to privilege escalation or
 unauthorized access in applications that rely on python-jose for token
 validation. This issue is exploitable unless developers explicitly reject
 'alg=none' tokens, which is not enforced by the library.
