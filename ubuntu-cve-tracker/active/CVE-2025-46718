 https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/commit/848719f28067d3b5e6672d07f34da5b24f85765b (v0.2.6)
Description:
 sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust.
 Prior to version 0.2.6, users with limited sudo privileges (e.g. execution
 of a single command) can list sudo privileges of other users using the `-U`
 flag. This vulnerability allows users with limited sudo privileges to
 enumerate the sudoers file, revealing sensitive information about other
 users' permissions. Attackers can collect information that can be used to
 more targeted attacks. Systems where users either do not have sudo
 privileges or have the ability to run all commands as root through sudo
 (the default configuration on most systems) are not affected by this
 advisory. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.
