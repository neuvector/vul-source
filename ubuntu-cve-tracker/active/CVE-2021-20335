Description:
 For MongoDB Ops Manager versions prior to and including 4.2.24 with
 multiple OM application servers, that have SSL turned on for their MongoDB
 processes, the upgrade to MongoDB Ops Manager versions prior to and
 including 4.4.12 triggers a bug where Automation thinks SSL is being turned
 off, and can disable SSL temporarily for members of the cluster. This issue
 is temporary and eventually corrects itself after MongoDB Ops Manager
 instances have finished upgrading to MongoDB Ops Manager 4.4. In addition,
 customers must be running with clientCertificateMode=OPTIONAL /
 allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates=true to be impacted*.* Customers
 upgrading from Ops Manager 4.2.X to 4.2.24 and finally to Ops Manager
 4.4.13+ are unaffected by this issue.
