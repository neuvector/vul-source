Description:
 Twig is a template language for PHP. In a sandbox, an attacker can call
 `__toString()` on an object even if the `__toString()` method is not
 allowed by the security policy when the object is part of an array or an
 argument list (arguments to a function or a filter for instance). This
 issue has been patched in versions 3.11.2 and 3.14.1. All users are advised
 to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
