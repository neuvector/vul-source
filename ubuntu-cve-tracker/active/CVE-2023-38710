Description:
 An issue was discovered in Libreswan before 4.12. When an IKEv2 Child SA
 REKEY packet contains an invalid IPsec protocol ID number of 0 or 1, an
 error notify INVALID_SPI is sent back. The notify payload's protocol ID is
 copied from the incoming packet, but the code that verifies outgoing
 packets fails an assertion that the protocol ID must be ESP (2) or AH(3)
 and causes the pluto daemon to crash and restart. NOTE: the earliest
 affected version is 3.20.
