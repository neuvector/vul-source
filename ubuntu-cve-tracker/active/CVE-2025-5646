Description:
 A vulnerability has been found in Radare2 5.9.9 and classified as
 problematic. This vulnerability affects the function r_cons_rainbow_free in
 the library /libr/cons/pal.c of the component radiff2. The manipulation of
 the argument -T leads to memory corruption. It is possible to launch the
 attack on the local host. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The
 exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the
 public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still
 doubted at the moment. The patch is identified as
 5705d99cc1f23f36f9a84aab26d1724010b97798. It is recommended to apply a
 patch to fix this issue. The documentation explains that the parameter -T
 is experimental and "crashy". Further analysis has shown "the race is not a
 real problem unless you use asan". A new warning has been added.
