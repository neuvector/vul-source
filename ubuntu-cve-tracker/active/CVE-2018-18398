Description:
 Xfce Thunar 1.6.15, when Xfce 4.12 is used, mishandles the IBus-Unikey
 input method for file searches within File Manager, leading to an
 out-of-bounds read and SEGV. This could potentially be exploited by an
 arbitrary local user who creates files in /tmp before the victim uses this
 input method.
