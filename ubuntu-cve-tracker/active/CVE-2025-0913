Candidate: CVE-2025-0913

Description:
 os.OpenFile(path, os.O_CREATE|O_EXCL) behaved differently on Unix and
 Windows systems when the target path was a dangling symlink. On Unix
 systems, OpenFile with O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags never follows symlinks. On
 Windows, when the target path was a symlink to a nonexistent location,
 OpenFile would create a file in that location. OpenFile now always returns
 an error when the O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags are both set and the target
 path is a symlink.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> this issue only affects Go on Windows
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
 mdeslaur> 
 mdeslaur> Warning: do not include nullboot in the list of no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuilds after fixing an issue in golang.
