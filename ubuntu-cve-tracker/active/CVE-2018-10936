Description:
 A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was
 possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host
 name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a
 condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted
 server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was
 signed by a trusted CA.
