Description:
 Allows the extraction filter to be ignored, allowing symlink targets to
 point outside the destination directory, and the modification of some file
 metadata.
 
 
 You are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to
 extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall() or
 TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of "data" or
 "tar". See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation
 https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter
  for more information.
 
 Note that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed
 from "no filtering" to `"data", so if you are relying on this new default
 behavior then your usage is also affected.
 
 Note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the
 installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source
 distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build
 process. However when evaluating source distributions it's important to
 avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 hlibk> The tarfile filter feature was introduced in Python version 3.12
  and subsequently backported to older versions. Older releases are not
  affected as the feature was never backported for the Ubuntu releases. For
  example, in Python 3.9, the tarfile filter feature was introduced in
  version 3.9.17. This can be checked in the Lib/shutil.py file whether the
  _unpack_tarfile function has a filter parameter. Relevant commit is
  98016f7c92aa4c1232c68bac1ed6646db31782ec for 3.9.17.
