Description:
 The package bottle from 0 and before 0.12.19 are vulnerable to Web Cache
 Poisoning by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker
 can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a
 difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running
 with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious
 requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually
 not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in
 a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.
