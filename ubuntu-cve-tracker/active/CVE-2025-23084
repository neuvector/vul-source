Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, specifically affecting the
 handling of drive names in the Windows environment. Certain Node.js
 functions do not treat drive names as special on Windows. As a result,
 although Node.js assumes a relative path, it actually refers to the root
 directory.
 
 On Windows, a path that does not start with the file separator is treated
 as relative to the current directory. 
 
 This vulnerability affects Windows users of `path.join` API.
