Description:
 Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A segmentation fault was
 found in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically
 doesn't show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it
 is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a
 gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function
 that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will
 access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated
 (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043.
