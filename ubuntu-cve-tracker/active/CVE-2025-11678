Description:
 Stack-based Buffer Overflow in lws_adns_parse_label in warmcat
 libwebsockets allows, when the LWS_WITH_SYS_ASYNC_DNS flag is enabled
 during compilation, to overflow the label_stack, when the attacker is able
 to sniff a DNS request in order to craft a response with a matching id
 containing a label longer than the maximum.
