Description:
 Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests.
 Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1,
 and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in Action Controller's
 HTTP Token authentication. For applications using HTTP Token authentication
 via `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or similar, a carefully
 crafted header may cause header parsing to take an unexpected amount of
 time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an
 affected release should either upgrade to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5,
 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. One may choose
 to use Ruby 3.2 as a workaround.Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem,
 so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails
 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.
