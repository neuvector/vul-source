Description:
 AWS SDK for PHP is the Amazon Web Services software development kit for
 PHP. Within the scope of requests to S3 object keys and/or prefixes
 containing a Unix double-dot, a URI path traversal is possible. The issue
 exists in the `buildEndpoint` method in the RestSerializer component of the
 AWS SDK for PHP v3 prior to 3.288.1. The `buildEndpoint` method relies on
 the Guzzle Psr7 UriResolver utility, which strips dot segments from the
 request path in accordance with RFC 3986. Under certain conditions, this
 could lead to an arbitrary object being accessed. This issue has been
 patched in version 3.288.1.
