Description:
 A malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver
 reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the
 network than are in the body. A malicious HTTP client can further exploit
 this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to
 about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request.
 Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including
 additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked
 encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A
 sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each
 byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of
 real body to encoded bytes grows too small.
