Description:
 Twig is a template language for PHP. Versions 1.x prior to 1.44.7, 2.x
 prior to 2.15.3, and 3.x prior to 3.4.3 encounter an issue when the
 filesystem loader loads templates for which the name is a user input. It is
 possible to use the `source` or `include` statement to read arbitrary files
 from outside the templates' directory when using a namespace like
 `@somewhere/../some.file`. In such a case, validation is bypassed. Versions
 1.44.7, 2.15.3, and 3.4.3 contain a fix for validation of such template
 names. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
