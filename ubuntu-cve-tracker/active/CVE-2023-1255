Description:
 Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM
 platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,
 leading to a crash. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS
 algorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash in rare circumstances. The
 AES-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk encryption. The AES-XTS cipher
 decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read past the end of
 the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16 byte blocks,
 e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is
 unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service.
 If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer
 being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the
 application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a Low
 severity one.
