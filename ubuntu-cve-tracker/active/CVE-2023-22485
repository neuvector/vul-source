Description:
 cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering
 library and program in C. In versions prior 0.29.0.gfm.7, a crafted
 markdown document can trigger an out-of-bounds read in the
 `validate_protocol` function. We believe this bug is harmless in practice,
 because the out-of-bounds read accesses `malloc` metadata without causing
 any visible damage.This vulnerability has been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.7.
