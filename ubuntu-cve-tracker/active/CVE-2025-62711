Description:
 Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. In versions from 38.0.0 to before
 38.0.3, the implementation of component-model related host-to-wasm
 trampolines in Wasmtime contained a bug where it's possible to carefully
 craft a component, which when called in a specific way, would crash the
 host with a segfault or assert failure. Wasmtime 38.0.3 has been released
 and is patched to fix this issue. There are no workarounds.
