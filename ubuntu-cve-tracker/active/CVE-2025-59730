Description:
 When decoding a frame for a SANM file (ANIM v0 variant), the decoded data
 can be larger than the buffer allocated for it.
 
 Frames encoded with codec 48 can specify their resolution (width x height).
 A buffer of appropriate size is allocated depending on the resolution.
 
 This codec can encode the frame contents using a run-length encoding
 algorithm. There are no checks that the decoded frame fits in the allocated
 buffer, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.
 
 process_frame_obj initializes the buffers based on the frame resolution:
 
 
 
 We recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.
