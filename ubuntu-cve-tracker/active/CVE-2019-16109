Description:
 An issue was discovered in Plataformatec Devise before 4.7.1. It confirms
 accounts upon receiving a request with a blank confirmation_token, if a
 database record has a blank value in the confirmation_token column.
 (However, there is no scenario within Devise itself in which such database
 records would exist.)
