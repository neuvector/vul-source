Description:
 An excessively large PDF page size (found in fuzz testing, unlikely in
 normal PDF files) can result in a divide-by-zero in Xpdf's text extraction
 code. This is related to CVE-2022-30524, but the problem here is caused by
 a very large page size, rather than by a very large character coordinate.
