Description:
 gorilla/csrf provides Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention
 middleware for Go web applications & services. Prior to 1.7.2, gorilla/csrf
 does not validate the Origin header against an allowlist. Its executes its
 validation of the Referer header for cross-origin requests only when it
 believes the request is being served over TLS. It determines this by
 inspecting the r.URL.Scheme value. However, this value is never populated
 for "server" requests per the Go spec, and so this check does not run in
 practice. This vulnerability allows an attacker who has gained XSS on a
 subdomain or top level domain to perform authenticated form submissions
 against gorilla/csrf protected targets that share the same top level
 domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.2.
