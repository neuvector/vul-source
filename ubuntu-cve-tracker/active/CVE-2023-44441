Description:
 GIMP DDS File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within
 the parsing of DDS files. The issue results from the lack of proper
 validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a
 heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute
 code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22093.
