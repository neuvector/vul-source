Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O. A symlink
 traversal vulnerability in the containers/storage library can cause Podman,
 Buildah, and CRI-O to hang and result in a denial of service via OOM kill
 when running a malicious image using an automatically assigned user
 namespace (`--userns=auto` in Podman and Buildah). The containers/storage
 library will read /etc/passwd inside the container, but does not properly
 validate if that file is a symlink, which can be used to cause the library
 to read an arbitrary file on the host.
