Description:
 In ConnMan through 1.44, parse_rr in dnsproxy.c has a memcpy length that
 depends on an RR RDLENGTH value, i.e., *rdlen=ntohs(rr->rdlen) and
 memcpy(response+offset,*end,*rdlen) without a check for whether the sum of
 *end and *rdlen exceeds max. Consequently, *rdlen may be larger than the
 amount of remaining packet data in the current state of parsing. Values of
 stack memory locations may be sent over the network in a response.
