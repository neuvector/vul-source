Description:
 Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and
 command-line interface. Between versions 2.3.0 and 2.8.2, the `doc` module
 of Icinga Web 2 allows to view documentation directly in the UI. It must be
 enabled manually by an administrator and users need explicit access
 permission to use it. Then, by visiting a certain route, it is possible to
 gain access to arbitrary files readable by the web-server user. The issue
 has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, an
 administrator may disable the `doc` module or revoke permission to use it
 from all users.
