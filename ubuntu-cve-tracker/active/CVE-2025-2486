Notes:
 mdeslaur> incomplete fix for CVE-2023-48733
 mdeslaur> In response to CVE-2023-48733, a different patch was backported
 mdeslaur> to Jammy and Focal, that merely disables the Shell, but does not
 mdeslaur> remove it, which did apply to AAVMF as well, hence only Noble,
 mdeslaur> Oracular, and Plucky are vulnerable.
