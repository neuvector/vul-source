Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The npm ci command in npm 7.x and 8.x through 8.1.3 proceeds
 with an installation even if dependency information in package-lock.json
 differs from package.json. This behavior is inconsistent with the
 documentation, and makes it easier for attackers to install malware that
 was supposed to have been blocked by an exact version match requirement in
 package-lock.json. NOTE: The npm team believes this is not a vulnerability.
 It would require someone to socially engineer package.json which has
 different dependencies than package-lock.json. That user would have to have
 file system or write access to change dependencies. The npm team states
 preventing malicious actors from socially engineering or gaining file
 system access is outside the scope of the npm CLI.
