Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Prior
 to versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8, malicious user can create a snapshot and
 arbitrarily choose the `originalUrl` parameter by editing the query, thanks
 to a web proxy. When another user opens the URL of the snapshot, they will
 be presented with the regular web interface delivered by the trusted
 Grafana server. The `Open original dashboard` button no longer points to
 the to the real original dashboard but to the attackerâ€™s injected URL. This
 issue is fixed in versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8.

  be affected by this - but needs a closer look
