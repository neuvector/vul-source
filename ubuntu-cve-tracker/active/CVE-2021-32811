Description:
 Zope is an open-source web application server. Zope versions prior to
 versions 4.6.3 and 5.3 have a remote code execution security issue. In
 order to be affected, one must use Python 3 for one's Zope deployment, run
 Zope 4 below version 4.6.3 or Zope 5 below version 5.3, and have the
 optional `Products.PythonScripts` add-on package installed. By default, one
 must have the admin-level Zope "Manager" role to add or edit Script
 (Python) objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to
 add/edit these scripts through the web are at risk. Zope releases 4.6.3 and
 5.3 are not vulnerable. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict
 adding/editing Script (Python) objects through the web using the standard
 Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be
 assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the
 web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default
 configuration in Zope.
