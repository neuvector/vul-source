Description:
 The scrapy/scrapy project is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
 attacks due to the use of lxml.etree.fromstring for parsing untrusted XML
 data without proper validation. This vulnerability allows attackers to
 perform denial of service attacks, access local files, generate network
 connections, or circumvent firewalls by submitting specially crafted XML
 data.
