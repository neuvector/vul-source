Description:
 All versions of Samba prior to 4.13.16 are vulnerable to a malicious client
 using an SMB1 or NFS race to allow a directory to be created in an area of
 the server file system not exported under the share definition. Note that
 SMB1 has to be enabled, or the share also available via NFS in order for
 this attack to succeed.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
Mitigation:
 This issue can be mitigated by disabling SMB1, which is the default
 configuration in Samba 4.11 and above. In environments where SMB1 cannot
 be disabled, symlink support can be disabled with unix extensions = no.
