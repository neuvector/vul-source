Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. When
 parsing an incoming Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) request, Redis allocates
 memory according to user-specified values which determine the number of
 elements (in the multi-bulk header) and size of each element (in the bulk
 header). An attacker delivering specially crafted requests over multiple
 connections can cause the server to allocate significant amount of memory.
 Because the same parsing mechanism is used to handle authentication
 requests, this vulnerability can also be exploited by unauthenticated
 users. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An
 additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the
 redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users
 from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways: Using network
 access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc. or
 Enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side
 certificates.
