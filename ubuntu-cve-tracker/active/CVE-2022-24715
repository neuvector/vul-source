Description:
 Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and
 command-line interface. Authenticated users, with access to the
 configuration, can create SSH resource files in unintended directories,
 leading to the execution of arbitrary code. This issue has been resolved in
 versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2. Users unable to upgrade
 should limit access to the Icinga Web 2 configuration.
