Description:
 A PV guest could DoS Xen while unmapping a grant To address XSA-380,
 reference counting was introduced for grant mappings for the case where a
 PV guest would have the IOMMU enabled. PV guests can request two forms of
 mappings. When both are in use for any individual mapping, unmapping of
 such a mapping can be requested in two steps. The reference count for such
 a mapping would then mistakenly be decremented twice. Underflow of the
 counters gets detected, resulting in the triggering of a hypervisor bug
 check.
