 https://github.com/micromatch/braces/blob/98414f9f1fabe021736e26836d8306d5de747e0d/lib/parse.js#L308
Description:
 The NPM package `braces`, versions prior to 3.0.3, fails to limit the
 number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion.
 In `lib/parse.js,` if a malicious user sends "imbalanced braces" as input,
 the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the program to start
 allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the loop.
 Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will
 crash.
