Description:
 The email module of Python through 3.11.3 incorrectly parses e-mail
 addresses that contain a special character. The wrong portion of an RFC2822
 header is identified as the value of the addr-spec. In some applications,
 an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which application access
 is granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail to a specific domain
 (e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be used for signup). This
 occurs in email/_parseaddr.py in recent versions of Python.
