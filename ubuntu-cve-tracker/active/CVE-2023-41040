Description:
 GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. In
 order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the `.git`
 directory, in some places the name of the file being read is provided by
 the user, GitPython doesn't check if this file is located outside the
 `.git` directory. This allows an attacker to make GitPython read any file
 from the system. This vulnerability is present in
 https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175.
 That code joins the base directory with a user given string without
 checking if the final path is located outside the base directory. This
 vulnerability cannot be used to read the contents of files but could in
 theory be used to trigger a denial of service for the program. This issue
 has not yet been addressed.
