Description:
 The filepath.Walk and filepath.WalkDir functions are documented as not
 following symbolic links, but both functions are susceptible to a TOCTOU
 (time of check/time of use) race condition where a portion of the path
 being walked is replaced with a symbolic link while the walk is in
 progress.
