Description:
 When rendering certain unicode sequences, grub2's font code doesn't proper
 validate if the informed glyph's width and height is constrained within
 bitmap size. As consequence an attacker can craft an input which will lead
 to a out-of-bounds write into grub2's heap, leading to memory corruption
 and availability issues. Although complex, arbitrary code execution could
 not be discarded.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes
 eslerm> the grub2 package unlikely affects Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2 and grub2-unsigned should have same major version
 eslerm> Ubuntu Secure Boot and ESM do not cover i386
 eslerm> trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new versions of grub
 eslerm| Note that key revocation is required to protect against
  evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
