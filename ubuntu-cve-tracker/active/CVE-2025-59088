Description:
 If kdcproxy receives a request for a realm which does not have server
 addresses defined in its configuration, by default, it will query SRV
 records in the DNS zone matching the requested realm name. This creates a
 server-side request forgery vulnerability, since an attacker could send a
 request for a realm matching a DNS zone where they created SRV records
 pointing to arbitrary ports and hostnames (which may resolve to loopback or
 internal IP addresses). This vulnerability can be exploited to probe
 internal network topology and firewall rules, perform port scanning, and
 exfiltrate data. Deployments where
 the "use_dns" setting is explicitly set to false are not affected.
