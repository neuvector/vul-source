Description:
 ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software
 application The file parameter is vulnerable to a cross site scripting
 vulnerability (XSS) by backing out of the current "tr" "td" brackets. This
 then allows a malicious user to provide code that will execute when a user
 views the specific log on the "view=log" page. This vulnerability allows an
 attacker to store code within the logs that will be executed when loaded by
 a legitimate user. These actions will be performed with the permission of
 the victim. This could lead to data loss and/or further exploitation
 including account takeover. This issue has been addressed in versions
 `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
 upgrade should disable database logging.
