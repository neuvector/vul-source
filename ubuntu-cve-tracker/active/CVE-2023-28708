Description:
 When using the RemoteIpFilter with requests received from a    reverse
 proxy via HTTP that include the X-Forwarded-Proto    header set to https,
 session cookies created by Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.0.-M2, 10.1.0-M1
 to 10.1.5, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.71 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.85 did not include the
 secure attribute. This could result in the user agent transmitting the
 session cookie over an insecure channel.
 
 Older, EOL versions may also be affected.
