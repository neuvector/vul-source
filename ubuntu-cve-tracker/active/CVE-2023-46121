Description:
 yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The Generic
 Extractor in yt-dlp is vulnerable to an attacker setting an arbitrary proxy
 for a request to an arbitrary url, allowing the attacker to MITM the
 request made from yt-dlp's HTTP session. This could lead to cookie
 exfiltration in some cases. Version 2023.11.14 removed the ability to
 smuggle `http_headers` to the Generic extractor, as well as other
 extractors that use the same pattern. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
 unable to upgrade should disable the Ggneric extractor (or only pass
 trusted sites with trusted content) and ake caution when using
 `--no-check-certificate`.
