Description:
 Versions of OpenPubkey library prior to 0.10.0  contained a vulnerability
 that would allow a specially crafted JWS to bypass signature verification.
 As OPKSSH depends on the OpenPubkey library for authentication, this
 vulnerability in OpenPubkey also applies to OPKSSH versions prior to 0.5.0
 and would allow an attacker to bypass OPKSSH authentication.
