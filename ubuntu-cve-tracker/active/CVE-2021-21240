Description:
 httplib2 is a comprehensive HTTP client library for Python. In httplib2
 before version 0.19.0, a malicious server which responds with long series
 of "\xa0" characters in the "www-authenticate" header may cause Denial of
 Service (CPU burn while parsing header) of the httplib2 client accessing
 said server. This is fixed in version 0.19.0 which contains a new
 implementation of auth headers parsing using the pyparsing library.
