Description:

Notes:
 iconstantin> ghostscript 9.26~dfsg+0-0ubuntu0.16.04.14+esm2 for xenial
  was released to address this CVE but it was thereafter determined that
  the impacted code is not compiled and so the package is not vulnerable.
 iconstantin> still need to verify if commits from PR 1397 and 1398 should 
  be included as part of our patch.
 sbeattie> fix is being worked in pull request 1346.
 mdeslaur> this only affects the opj_* tools in the liopenjp2-tools
 mdeslaur> universe package
