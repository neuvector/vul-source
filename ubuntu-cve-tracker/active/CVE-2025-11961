Description:
 pcap_ether_aton() is an auxiliary function in libpcap, it takes a string
 argument and returns a fixed-size allocated buffer.  The string argument
 must be a well-formed MAC-48 address in one of the supported formats, but
 this requirement has been poorly documented.  If an application calls the
 function with an argument that deviates from the expected format, the
 function can read data beyond the end of the provided string and write data
 beyond the end of the allocated buffer.
