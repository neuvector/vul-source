Description:
 mod_auth_openidc is an authentication and authorization module for the
 Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party
 functionality. In versions 2.0.0 through 2.4.13.1, when `OIDCStripCookies`
 is set and a crafted cookie supplied, a NULL pointer dereference would
 occur, resulting in a segmentation fault. This could be used in a
 Denial-of-Service attack and thus presents an availability risk. Version
 2.4.13.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using
 `OIDCStripCookies`.
