Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not specify a
 blowfish_secret key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates one at
 runtime. A vulnerability was reported where the way this value is created
 uses a weak algorithm. This could allow an attacker to determine the user's
 blowfish_secret and potentially decrypt their cookies. All 4.6.x versions
 (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions
 (prior to 4.0.10.18) are affected.
