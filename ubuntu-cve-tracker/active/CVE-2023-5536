Description:
 A feature in LXD (LP#1829071), affects the default configuration of
 Ubuntu Server which allows privileged users in the lxd group to
 escalate their privilege to root without requiring a sudo password.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> Ubuntu Server installed with subiquity before 23.04 is affected
 eslerm> Ubuntu Server installed with cloud-init before 24.04 is affected
 eslerm> Ubuntu Desktop is not affected
 eslerm| a LXD feature became a vulnerability in Ubuntu Server when
  it was enabled as a default
 eslerm| cloud-init and subiquity are used for tracking, these
  packages merely implemented Server defaults
 eslerm| removing this LXD feature with a security patch would break
  existing workflows
 eslerm> Mitigation must be performed manually.
Mitigation:
 Remove users from lxd group and configure multi-user LXD mode.
