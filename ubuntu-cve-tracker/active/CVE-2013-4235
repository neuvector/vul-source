Description:
 shadow: TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition when copying and
 removing directory trees
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> The original issue associated with this CVE is issue 317,
 ccdm94> which provides a fix through commit dcca865. However, another
 ccdm94> pull request which references this issue was opened at a
 ccdm94> later date, this being PR 545. This pull request is said
 ccdm94> to actually address the issue while commit dcca865 was only
 ccdm94> a work around to the problem. Additionally, from the first
 ccdm94> comment that can be seen in PR 483, it seems like commit
 ccdm94> b447216 is also needed in order to completely fix this
 ccdm94> issue. Three commits fixing regressions introduced
 ccdm94> by one of the fix commits have been added after release
 ccdm94> 4.12.2, which is considered by upstream as the fixed release.
 ccdm94> These commit are: f3bdb28, 10cd68e and cde221b. They are
 ccdm94> a part of version 4.13 of shadow.
 ccdm94> One of the commits that needs to be applied in order to fix
 ccdm94> this CVE introduces a regression in focal and earlier, as
 ccdm94> seen by launchpad bug 1998169. The commit which seems to
 ccdm94> cause the issue is commit f3bdb28. Flag AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
 ccdm94> is not implemented in the kernel for function fchmodat, and,
 ccdm94> for focal and earlier, glibc does not contain commit
 ccdm94> 752dd17443, which fixes this problem. Therefore, useradd was
 ccdm94> not behaving correctly in focal and earlier once the fix for
 ccdm94> this issue was applied.
