Description:
 Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers.
 Prior to version 1.6.5, Authlib’s JOSE implementation accepts unbounded
 JWS/JWT header and signature segments. A remote attacker can craft a token
 whose base64url‑encoded header or signature spans hundreds of megabytes.
 During verification, Authlib decodes and parses the full input before it is
 rejected, driving CPU and memory consumption to hostile levels and enabling
 denial of service. Version 1.6.5 patches the issue. Some temporary
 workarounds are available. Enforce input size limits before handing tokens
 to Authlib and/or use application-level throttling to reduce amplification
 risk.
