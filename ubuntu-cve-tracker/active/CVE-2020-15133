Description:
 In faye-websocket before version 0.11.0, there is a lack of certification
 validation in TLS handshakes. The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the
 `EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLS
 handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This method
 does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that it
 does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificate
 for the expected hostname. That means that any `wss:` connection made using
 this library is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not
 confirm the identity of the server it is connected to. For further
 background information on this issue, please see the referenced GitHub
 Advisory. Upgrading `faye-websocket` to v0.11.0 is recommended.
