Description:
 ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When using the Chainsaw or SocketAppender
 components with Log4j 1.x on JRE less than 1.7, an attacker that manages to
 cause a logging entry involving a specially-crafted (ie, deeply nested)
 hashmap or hashtable (depending on which logging component is in use) to be
 processed could exhaust the available memory in the virtual machine and
 achieve Denial of Service when the object is deserialized. This issue
 affects Apache Log4j before 2. Affected users are recommended to update to
 Log4j 2.x. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no
 longer supported by the maintainer.
