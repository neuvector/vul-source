Description:
 In GLPI before 9.4.6, an attacker can execute system commands by abusing
 the backup functionality. Theoretically, this vulnerability can be
 exploited by an attacker without a valid account by using a CSRF. Due to
 the difficulty of the exploitation, the attack is only conceivable by an
 account having Maintenance privileges and the right to add WIFI networks.
 This is fixed in version 9.4.6.
