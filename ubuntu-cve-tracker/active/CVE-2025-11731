Description:
 A flaw was found in the exsltFuncResultComp() function of libxslt, which
 handles EXSLT <func:result> elements during stylesheet parsing. Due to
 improper type handling, the function may treat an XML document node as a
 regular XML element node, resulting in a type confusion. This can cause
 unexpected memory reads and potential crashes. While difficult to exploit,
 the flaw could lead to application instability or denial of service.
