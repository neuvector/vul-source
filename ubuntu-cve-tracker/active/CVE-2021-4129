Description:
 Mozilla developers and community members Julian Hector, Randell Jesup,
 Gabriele Svelto, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, and Masayuki Nakano
 reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 94. Some of these bugs
 showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort
 some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 95, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Thunderbird <
 91.4.0.
