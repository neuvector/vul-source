Description:
 A log spoofing flaw was found in the Tuned package due to improper
 sanitization of some API arguments. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a
 controlled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log.
 Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and
 trick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs
 citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the
 spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged
 string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for
 example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use
 Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations.
