Description:
 A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x
 through 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a
 specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service
 has JDOM 1.x or 2.x jar in the classpath, an attacker can send a
 specifically crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local
 files on the server.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled 
 deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain
 sensitive information.
