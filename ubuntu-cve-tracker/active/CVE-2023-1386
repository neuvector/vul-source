Description:
 A flaw was found in the 9p passthrough filesystem (9pfs) implementation in
 QEMU. When a local user in the guest writes an executable file with SUID or
 SGID, none of these privileged bits are correctly dropped. As a result, in
 rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by malicious users in the guest
 to elevate their privileges within the guest and help a host local user to
 elevate privileges on the host.
