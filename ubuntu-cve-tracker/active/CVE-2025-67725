Description:
 Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. In
 versions 6.5.2 and below, a single maliciously crafted HTTP request can
 block the server's event loop for an extended period, caused by the
 HTTPHeaders.add method. The function accumulates values using string
 concatenation when the same header name is repeated, causing a Denial of
 Service (DoS).  Due to Python string immutability, each concatenation
 copies the entire string, resulting in O(n²) time complexity. The severity
 can vary from high if max_header_size has been increased from its default,
 to low if it has its default value of 64KB. This issue is fixed in version
 6.5.3.
