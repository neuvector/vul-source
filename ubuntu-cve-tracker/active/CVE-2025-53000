Description:
 The nbconvert tool, jupyter nbconvert, converts Jupyter notebooks to
 various other formats via Jinja templates. Versions of nbconvert up to and
 including 7.16.6 on Windows have a vulnerability in which converting a
 notebook containing SVG output to a PDF results in unauthorized code
 execution. Specifically, a third party can create a `inkscape.bat` file
 that defines a Windows batch script, capable of arbitrary code execution.
 When a user runs `jupyter nbconvert --to pdf` on a notebook containing SVG
 output to a PDF on a Windows platform from this directory, the
 `inkscape.bat` file is run unexpectedly. As of time of publication, no
 known patches exist.
