Description:
 OpenStack Murano before 1.0.3 (liberty) and 2.x before 2.0.1 (mitaka),
 Murano-dashboard before 1.0.3 (liberty) and 2.x before 2.0.1 (mitaka), and
 python-muranoclient before 0.7.3 (liberty) and 0.8.x before 0.8.5 (mitaka)
 improperly use loaders inherited from yaml.Loader when parsing MuranoPL and
 UI files, which allows remote attackers to create arbitrary Python objects
 and execute arbitrary code via crafted extended YAML tags in UI definitions
 in packages.
