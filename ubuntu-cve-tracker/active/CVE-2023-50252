 https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/commit/08ce6a96d63ad7216315fae34a61c886dd2dc030
Description:
 php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library. Prior to version
 0.5.1, when handling `<use>` tag that references an `<image>` tag, it
 merges the attributes from the `<use>` tag to the `<image>` tag. The
 problem pops up especially when the `href` attribute from the `<use>` tag
 has not been sanitized. This can lead to an unsafe file read that can cause
 PHAR Deserialization vulnerability in PHP prior to version 8. Version 0.5.1
 contains a patch for this issue.
