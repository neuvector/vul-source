 https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/blob/7c486a1121a4bf71d50ff555fab2770294b748d7/src/heif.imageio/heifinput.cpp#L250
Description:
 OpenImageIO is a toolset for reading, writing, and manipulating image files
 of any image file format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic
 API with a feature set, scalability, and robustness needed for feature film
 production. In affected versions there is a bug in the heif input
 functionality of OpenImageIO. Specifically, in
 `HeifInput::seek_subimage()`.  In the worst case, this can lead to an
 information disclosure vulnerability, particularly for programs that
 directly use the `ImageInput` APIs. This bug has been addressed in commit
 `0a2dcb4c` which is included in the 2.5.13.1 release. Users are advised to
 upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
