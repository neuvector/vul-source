Description:
 In Node.js including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before
 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1, an attacker can cause a Denial of Service
 (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by
 sending headers very slowly. This keeps the connection and associated
 resources alive for a long period of time. Potential attacks are mitigated
 by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is
 an extension of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and impacts all
 active Node.js release lines including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before
 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Marco Pracucci discovered that Node.js mishandled HTTP and HTTPS connections.
 An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
