Description:
 Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. Incorrect error
 handling for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete
 clean-up of the failed request which created a memory leak. A large number
 of such requests could trigger an OutOfMemoryException resulting in a
 denial of service.
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 9.0.76 through 9.0.102, from 10.1.10
 through 10.1.39, from 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5.
 The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are
 known to be affected: 8.5.90 though 8.5.100.
 
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6
 which fix the issue.
