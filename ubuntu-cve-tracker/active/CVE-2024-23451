Description:
 Incorrect Authorization issue exists in the API key based security model
 for Remote Cluster Security, which is currently in Beta, in Elasticsearch
 8.10.0 and before 8.13.0. This allows aÂ malicious user with a valid API key
 for a remote cluster configured to use the new Remote Cluster Security to
 read arbitrary documents from any index on the remote cluster, and only if
 they use the Elasticsearch custom transport protocol to issue requests with
 the target index ID, the shard ID and the document ID. None of
 Elasticsearch REST API endpoints are affected by this issue.
