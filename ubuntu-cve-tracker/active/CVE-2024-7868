Description:
 In Xpdf 4.05 (and earlier), invalid header info in a DCT (JPEG) stream can
 lead to an uninitialized variable in the DCT decoder. The proof-of-concept
 PDF file causes a segfault attempting to read from an invalid address.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> In trusty to bionic, xpdf is built with poppler as the backend
 mdeslaur> library, so most xpdf issues don't apply to it. In jammy and
 mdeslaur> later, the xpdf package is actually xpopple, a fork that also
 mdeslaur> builds against poppler.
