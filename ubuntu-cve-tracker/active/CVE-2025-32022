Description:
 Finit provides fast init for Linux systems. Finit's urandom plugin has a
 heap buffer overwrite vulnerability at boot which leads to it overwriting
 other parts of the heap, possibly causing random instabilities and
 undefined behavior. The urandom plugin is enabled by default, so this bug
 affects everyone using Finit 4.2 or later that do not explicitly disable
 the plugin at build time. This bug is fixed in Finit 4.12. Those who cannot
 upgrade or backport the fix to urandom.c are strongly recommended to
 disable the plugin in the call to the `configure` script.
