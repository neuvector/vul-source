Description:
 node-tar is a Tar for Node.js. node-tar prior to version 6.2.1 has no limit
 on the number of sub-folders created in the folder creation process. An
 attacker who generates a large number of sub-folders can consume memory on
 the system running node-tar and even crash the Node.js client within few
 seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside.
 Version 6.2.1 fixes this issue by preventing extraction in excessively deep
 sub-folders.
