Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Versions prior to 9.2.4, or 8.5.15 on the 8.X branch, are subject to
 Improper Input Validation. Grafana admins can invite other members to the
 organization they are an admin for. When admins add members to the
 organization, non existing users get an email invite, existing members are
 added directly to the organization. When an invite link is sent, it allows
 users to sign up with whatever username/email address the user chooses and
 become a member of the organization. This introduces a vulnerability which
 can be used with malicious intent. This issue is patched in version 9.2.4,
 and has been backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.
