Description:
 smtpd/lka_filter.c in OpenSMTPD before 6.8.0p1, in certain configurations,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
 dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted pattern of client activity,
 because the filter state machine does not properly maintain the I/O channel
 between the SMTP engine and the filters layer.
