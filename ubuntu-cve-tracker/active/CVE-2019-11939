Description:
 Golang Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages
 declaring containers of sizes larger than the payload. As a result,
 malicious clients could send short messages which would result in a large
 memory allocation, potentially leading to denial of service. This issue
 affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2020.03.16.00.
