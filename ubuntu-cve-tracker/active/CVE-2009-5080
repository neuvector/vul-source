Description:
 The (1) contrib/eqn2graph/eqn2graph.sh, (2)
 contrib/grap2graph/grap2graph.sh, and (3) contrib/pic2graph/pic2graph.sh
 scripts in GNU troff (aka groff) 1.21 and earlier do not properly handle
 certain failed attempts to create temporary directories, which might allow
 local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a file in
 a temporary directory, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1296.
