Description:
 An optional feature of PCI MSI called "Multiple Message" allows a
 device to use multiple consecutive interrupt vectors.  Unlike for MSI-X,
 the setting up of these consecutive vectors needs to happen all in one
 go.  In this handling an error path could be taken in different
 situations, with or without a particular lock held.  This error path
 wrongly releases the lock even when it is not currently held.
