Description:
 Teeworlds up to and including 0.7.5 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. A map
 parser does not validate m_Channels value coming from a map file, leading
 to a buffer overflow. A malicious server may offer a specially crafted map
 that will overwrite client's stack causing denial of service or code
 execution.
