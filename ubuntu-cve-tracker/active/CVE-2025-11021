Description:
 A flaw was found in the cookie date handling logic of the libsoup HTTP
 library, widely used by GNOME and other applications for web communication.
 When processing cookies with specially crafted expiration dates, the
 library may perform an out-of-bounds memory read. This flaw could result in
 unintended disclosure of memory contents, potentially exposing sensitive
 information from the process using libsoup.
