Description:
 In the bindata RubyGem before version 2.4.10 there is a potential
 denial-of-service vulnerability. In affected versions it is very slow for
 certain classes in BinData to be created. For example BinData::Bit100000,
 BinData::Bit100001, BinData::Bit100002, BinData::Bit<N>. In combination
 with <user_input>.constantize there is a potential for a CPU-based DoS. In
 version 2.4.10 bindata improved the creation time of Bits and Integers.
