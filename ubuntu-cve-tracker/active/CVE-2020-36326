 https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/e2e07a355ee8ff36aba21d0242c5950c56e4c6f9
Description:
 PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through Phar
 Deserialization via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this is
 similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality
 problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by
 PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix
 eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.
