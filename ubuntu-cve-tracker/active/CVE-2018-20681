Description:
 mate-screensaver before 1.20.2 in MATE Desktop Environment allows
 physically proximate attackers to view screen content and possibly control
 applications. By unplugging and re-plugging or power-cycling external
 output devices (such as additionally attached graphical outputs via HDMI,
 VGA, DVI, etc.) the content of a screensaver-locked session can be
 revealed. In some scenarios, the attacker can execute applications, such as
 by clicking with a mouse.
