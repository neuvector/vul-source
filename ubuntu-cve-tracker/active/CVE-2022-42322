Description:
 Xenstore: Cooperating guests can create arbitrary numbers of nodes T[his
 CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which
 aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Since the fix of XSA-322
 any Xenstore node owned by a removed domain will be modified to be owned by
 Dom0. This will allow two malicious guests working together to create an
 arbitrary number of Xenstore nodes. This is possible by domain A letting
 domain B write into domain A's local Xenstore tree. Domain B can then
 create many nodes and reboot. The nodes created by domain B will now be
 owned by Dom0. By repeating this process over and over again an arbitrary
 number of nodes can be created, as Dom0's number of nodes isn't limited by
 Xenstore quota.
