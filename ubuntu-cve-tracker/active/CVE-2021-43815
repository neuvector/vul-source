Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Grafana prior to versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 has a directory traversal for
 arbitrary .csv files. It only affects instances that have the developer
 testing tool called TestData DB data source enabled and configured. The
 vulnerability is limited in scope, and only allows access to files with the
 extension .csv to authenticated users only. Grafana Cloud instances have
 not been affected by the vulnerability. Versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 contain a
 patch for this issue. There is a workaround available for users who cannot
 upgrade. Running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that normalizes the
 PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. The proxy will have to
 also be able to handle url encoded paths.
