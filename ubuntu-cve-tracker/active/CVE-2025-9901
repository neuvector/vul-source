Description:
 A flaw was found in libsoup’s caching mechanism, SoupCache, where the HTTP
 Vary header is ignored when evaluating cached responses. This header
 ensures that responses vary appropriately based on request headers such as
 language or authentication. Without this check, cached content can be
 incorrectly reused across different requests, potentially exposing
 sensitive user information. While the issue is unlikely to affect everyday
 desktop use, it could result in confidentiality breaches in proxy or
 multi-user environments.
