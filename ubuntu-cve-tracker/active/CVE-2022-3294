Description:
 Users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane network.
 Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify Node
 objects and send proxy requests to them. Kubernetes supports node proxying,
 which allows clients of kube-apiserver to access endpoints of a Kubelet to
 establish connections to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more. While
 Kubernetes already validates the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in
 kube-apiserver made it possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this
 validation could allow authenticated requests destined for Nodes to to the
 API server's private network.
