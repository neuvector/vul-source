Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenDKIM through 2.10.3, and 2.11.x through
 2.11.0-Beta2. It fails to keep track of ordinal numbers when removing fake
 Authentication-Results header fields, which allows a remote attacker to
 craft an e-mail message with a fake sender address such that programs that
 rely on Authentication-Results from OpenDKIM will treat the message as
 having a valid DKIM signature when in fact it has none.
