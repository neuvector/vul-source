Notes:
 alexmurray| Upstream dispute this as a valid CVE -
  https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/issues/377/allow-configuration-for-preventing-billion#comment-55227358
  - and they added a test-case for this type of attack of 2 years ago
  https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/commits/04378d05777d21d114a9cdc24976ad49c8919222
