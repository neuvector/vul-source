Description:
 A vulnerability was discovered in SPICE before version 0.14.1 where the
 generated code used for demarshalling messages lacked sufficient bounds
 checks. A malicious client or server, after authentication, could send
 specially crafted messages to its peer which would result in a crash or,
 potentially, other impacts.
