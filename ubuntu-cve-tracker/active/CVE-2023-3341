Description:
 The code that processes control channel messages sent to `named` calls
 certain functions recursively during packet parsing. Recursion depth is
 only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on the
 environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available
 stack memory, causing `named` to terminate unexpectedly. Since each
 incoming control channel message is fully parsed before its contents are
 authenticated, exploiting this flaw does not require the attacker to hold a
 valid RNDC key; only network access to the control channel's configured TCP
 port is necessary.
 This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.2.0 through 9.16.43, 9.18.0 through
 9.18.18, 9.19.0 through 9.19.16, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.16.43-S1, and 9.18.0-S1
 through 9.18.18-S1.
