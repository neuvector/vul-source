Description:
 The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows command injection.
 An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex
 designed to support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is
 passed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), an
 attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows drive
 letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z].
 Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Z
 and lower case letter a, such as the backtick character.
