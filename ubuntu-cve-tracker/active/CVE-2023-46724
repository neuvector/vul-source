Description:
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Improper Validation of
 Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to
 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service
 attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote
 server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS
 Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate
 chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in
 Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the
 stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a
 prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for
 availability information on updated packages.
