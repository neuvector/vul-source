Description:
 A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use
 a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port
 while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the
 outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission
 ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS
 Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data integrity.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This issue only affects dnsmasq in non-default configurations
 mdeslaur> where the server=<address>@<interface> option is used. In those
 mdeslaur> environments, this issue can be prevented by disabling cache by
 mdeslaur> also using a cache-size=0 configuration option.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> For the dnsmasq instance used by Network-Manager, it is not
 mdeslaur> vulnerable to this issue as Ubuntu disables caching by
 mdeslaur> default. (See Update-dnsmasq-parameters.patch in the
 mdeslaur> network-manager package)
