Description:
 If a TLS 1.3 client gets neither a PSK (pre shared key) extension nor a KSE
 (key share extension) when connecting to a malicious server, a default
 predictable buffer gets used for the IKM (Input Keying Material) value when
 generating the session master secret. Using a potentially known IKM value
 when generating the session master secret key compromises the key
 generated, allowing an eavesdropper to reconstruct it and potentially
 allowing access to or meddling with message contents in the session. This
 issue does not affect client validation of connected servers, nor expose
 private key information, but could result in an insecure TLS 1.3 session
 when not controlling both sides of the connection. wolfSSL recommends that
 TLS 1.3 client side users update the version of wolfSSL used.Â
