Description:
 gRPC contains a vulnerability whereby a client can cause a termination of
 connection between a HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server: a base64 encoding error
 for `-bin` suffixed headers will result in a disconnection by the gRPC
 server, but is typically allowed by HTTP2 proxies. We recommend upgrading
 beyond the commit inÂ  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309
