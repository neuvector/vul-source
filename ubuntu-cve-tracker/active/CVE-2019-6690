Description:
 python-gnupg 0.4.3 allows context-dependent attackers to trick gnupg to
 decrypt other ciphertext than intended. To perform the attack, the
 passphrase to gnupg must be controlled by the adversary and the ciphertext
 should be trusted. Related to a "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation" issue
 affecting the affect functionality component.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that python-gnupg incorrectly handled the GPG passphrase. A
 remote attacker could send a specially crafted passphrase that would allow
 them to control the output of encryption and decryption operations.
