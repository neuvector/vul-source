Description:
 An uncontrolled resource consumption (memory leak) flaw was found in
 ZeroMQ's src/xpub.cpp in versions before 4.3.3. This flaw allows a remote
 unauthenticated attacker to send crafted PUB messages that consume
 excessive memory if the CURVE/ZAP authentication is disabled on the server,
 causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
 to system availability.
