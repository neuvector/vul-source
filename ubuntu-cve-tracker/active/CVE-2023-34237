Description:
 SABnzbd is an open source automated Usenet download tool. A design flaw was
 discovered in SABnzbd that could allow remote code execution. Manipulating
 the Parameters setting in the Notification Script functionality allows code
 execution with the privileges of the SABnzbd process. Exploiting the
 vulnerabilities requires access to the web interface. Remote exploitation
 is possible if users[exposed their setup to the internet or other untrusted
 networks without setting a username/password. By default SABnzbd is only
 accessible from `localhost`, with no authentication required for the web
 interface. This issue has been patched in commits `e3a722` and `422b4f`
 which have been included in the 4.0.2 release. Users are advised to
 upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that a username and password
 have been set if their instance is web accessible.
