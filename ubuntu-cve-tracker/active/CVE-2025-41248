Description:
 The Spring Security annotation detection mechanism may not correctly
 resolve annotations on methods within type hierarchies with a parameterized
 super type with unbounded generics. This can be an issue when using
 @PreAuthorize and other method security annotations, resulting in an
 authorization bypass.
 
 Your application may be affected by this if you are using Spring Security's
 @EnableMethodSecurity feature.
 
 You are not affected by this if you are not using @EnableMethodSecurity or
 if you do not use security annotations on methods in generic superclasses
 or generic interfaces.
 
 This CVE is published in conjunction with  CVE-2025-41249
 https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41249 .
