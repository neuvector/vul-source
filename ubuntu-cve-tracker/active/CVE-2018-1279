Description:
 Pivotal RabbitMQ for PCF, all versions, uses a deterministically generated
 cookie that is shared between all machines when configured in a
 multi-tenant cluster. A remote attacker who can gain information about the
 network topology can guess this cookie and, if they have access to the
 right ports on any server in the MQ cluster can use this cookie to gain
 full control over the entire cluster.
