Description:
 nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer's clock, implementing the
 NTP and NTS protocols. There is a missing limit for accepted NTS-KE
 connections. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash
 ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server
 configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected.
 This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.3.
