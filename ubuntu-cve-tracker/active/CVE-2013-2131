 Format string vulnerability in the rrdtool module 1.4.7 for Python, as used
 in Zenoss, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) via format string specifiers to the rrdtool.graph function.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> xenial was patched in release version 1.4.8-1, and later
  it was upgraded to the new upstream version 1.5 that
  already has the fix (no need to add an explict patch).
  Since then, every Ubuntu release already has the fix applied.
