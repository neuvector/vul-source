Description:
 A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x
 through 14.7.5, and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through
 13.18-cert2. When processing a SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsub
 module stores the accepted formats present in the Accept headers of the
 request. This code did not limit the number of headers it processed,
 despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more than 32 Accept headers were
 present, the code would write outside of its memory and cause a crash.
