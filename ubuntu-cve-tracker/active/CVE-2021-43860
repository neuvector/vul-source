Description:
 Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. Prior
 to versions 1.12.3 and 1.10.6, Flatpak doesn't properly validate that the
 permissions displayed to the user for an app at install time match the
 actual permissions granted to the app at runtime, in the case that there's
 a null byte in the metadata file of an app. Therefore apps can grant
 themselves permissions without the consent of the user. Flatpak shows
 permissions to the user during install by reading them from the
 "xa.metadata" key in the commit metadata. This cannot contain a null
 terminator, because it is an untrusted GVariant. Flatpak compares these
 permissions to the *actual* metadata, from the "metadata" file to ensure it
 wasn't lied to. However, the actual metadata contents are loaded in several
 places where they are read as simple C-style strings. That means that, if
 the metadata file includes a null terminator, only the content of the file
 from *before* the terminator gets compared to xa.metadata. Thus, any
 permissions that appear in the metadata file after a null terminator are
 applied at runtime but not shown to the user. So maliciously crafted apps
 can give themselves hidden permissions. Users who have Flatpaks installed
 from untrusted sources are at risk in case the Flatpak has a maliciously
 crafted metadata file, either initially or in an update. This issue is
 patched in versions 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. As a workaround, users can manually
 check the permissions of installed apps by checking the metadata file or
 the xa.metadata key on the commit metadata.
