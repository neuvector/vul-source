Description:
 GNU cflow through 1.6 has a heap-based buffer over-read in the nexttoken
 function in parser.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> according to commit notes provided by upstream,
 ccdm94> the fix for this issue can be found in b9a7cd5e9d4.
 ccdm94> This is the same fix as the one for CVE-2019-16165.
 ccdm94> However, it seems like version 1.7, which would 
 ccdm94> already include it, is still vulnerable to the issue,
 ccdm94> the reproducer file generating the same heap-based
 ccdm94> buffer overflow error when cflow is run with ASAN.
 ccdm94> Therefore, it seems like a patch for this
 ccdm94> vulnerability is still needed as of version 1.7.
