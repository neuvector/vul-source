Description:
 The NtfsHandler.cpp NTFS handler in 7-Zip before 24.01 (for 7zz) contains
 an out-of-bounds read that allows an attacker to read beyond the intended
 buffer. The bytes read beyond the intended buffer are presented as a part
 of a filename listed in the file system image. This has security relevance
 in some known web-service use cases where untrusted users can upload files
 and have them extracted by a server-side 7-Zip process.
