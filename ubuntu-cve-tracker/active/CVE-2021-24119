Description:
 In Trusted Firmware Mbed TLS 2.24.0, a side-channel vulnerability in base64
 PEM file decoding allows system-level (administrator) attackers to obtain
 information about secret RSA keys via a controlled-channel and side-channel
 attack on software running in isolated environments that can be single
 stepped, especially Intel SGX.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> It looks like an entire new class of side-channel-free functions was
  introduced in newer versions of mbedtls; backporting all of them probably
  doesn't make sense, this fix only makes sense in context of trying to
  provide constant-time execution that limits side-channel bandwidth to
  adversaries on the same machine.
