Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C. When processing certain packets, PJSIP may incorrectly switch from using
 SRTP media transport to using basic RTP upon SRTP restart, causing the
 media to be sent insecurely. The vulnerability impacts all PJSIP users that
 use SRTP. The patch is available as commit d2acb9a in the master branch of
 the project and will be included in version 2.13. Users are advised to
 manually patch or to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
