Description:
 ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Input Validation vulnerability in
 Apache Axis allowed users with access to the admin service to perform
 possible SSRF
 This issue affects Apache Axis: through 1.3.
 
 As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine,
 such as Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build of Axis
 with the patch from
 https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06
  applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x
 release
 fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards
  this are welcome.
