Description:
 ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Input Validation vulnerability in
 Apache Axis allowed users with access to the admin service to perform
 possible SSRF This issue affects Apache Axis: through 1.3. As Axis 1 has
 been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as
 Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build of Axis with the
 patch from
 https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06
 applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x
 release fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work
 towards this are welcome.
