Description:
 FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.1 might allow attackers to have
 a variety of impacts by leveraging failure to block the logback-core class
 from polymorphic deserialization. Depending on the classpath content,
 remote code execution may be possible.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled 
 deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
 arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.
