Description:
 A flaw was found in all versions of kubeclient up to (but not including)
 v4.9.3, the Ruby client for Kubernetes REST API, in the way it parsed
 kubeconfig files. When the kubeconfig file does not configure custom CA to
 verify certs, kubeclient ends up accepting any certificate (it wrongly
 returns VERIFY_NONE). Ruby applications that leverage kubeclient to parse
 kubeconfig files are susceptible to Man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM).
