Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in the GRUB2 bootloader's network
 module that poses an immediate Denial of Service (DoS) risk. This flaw is a
 Use-after-Free issue, caused because the net_set_vlan command is not
 properly unregistered when the network module is unloaded from memory. An
 attacker who can execute this command can force the system to access memory
 locations that are no longer valid. Successful exploitation leads directly
 to system instability, which can result in a complete crash and halt system
 availability
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
