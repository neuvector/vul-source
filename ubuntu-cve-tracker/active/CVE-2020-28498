Description:
 The package elliptic before 6.5.4 are vulnerable to Cryptographic Issues
 via the secp256k1 implementation in elliptic/ec/key.js. There is no check
 to confirm that the public key point passed into the derive function
 actually exists on the secp256k1 curve. This results in the potential for
 the private key used in this implementation to be revealed after a number
 of ECDH operations are performed.
