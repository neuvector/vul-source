Description:
 The file download facility doesn't sufficiently sanitize file paths in
 certain situations. This may result in users gaining access to private
 files that they should not have access to. Some sites may require
 configuration changes following this security release. Review the release
 notes for your Drupal version if you have issues accessing private files
 after updating.
