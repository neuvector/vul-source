Description:
 A design flaw was found in Samba's DirSync control implementation, which
 exposes passwords and secrets in Active Directory to privileged users and
 Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs). This flaw allows RODCs and users
 possessing the GET_CHANGES right to access all attributes, including
 sensitive secrets and passwords. Even in a default setup, RODC DC accounts,
 which should only replicate some passwords, can gain access to all domain
 secrets, including the vital krbtgt, effectively eliminating the RODC / DC
 distinction. Furthermore, the vulnerability fails to account for error
 conditions (fail open), like out-of-memory situations, potentially granting
 access to secret attributes, even under low-privileged attacker influence.
