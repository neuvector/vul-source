Description:
 The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an
 insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if
 an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib
 is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue
 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.
