Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in j2k.c in OpenJPEG before r3002, as used in
 PDFium in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 invalid JPEG2000 data in a PDF document.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> There are large changes between openjpeg trunk and the 1.5 and 1.3
  branches that we shipped in Vivid and older. However, it looks like those
  code bases are also affected because I don't see similar sanity checks. As of
  2015-07-24, I don't see a fix in the 1.5 branch.
