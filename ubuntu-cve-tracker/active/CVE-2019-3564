Description:
 Go Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages with
 containers of fields of unknown type. As a result, malicious clients could
 send short messages which would take a long time for the server to parse,
 potentially leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook
 Thrift prior to v2019.03.04.00.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> it seems that this issue affected the go library in Apache
   Thrift as well.
 sbeattie> golang-github-uber-go-tally has an embedded copy of
   apache thrift
