Description:
 A flaw was found in Go. When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container
 runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper
 validation in the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an
 attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into mounting
 sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows
 attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation
 between containers and the host system.
