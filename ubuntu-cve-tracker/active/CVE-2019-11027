Description:
 Ruby OpenID (aka ruby-openid) through 2.8.0 has a remotely exploitable
 flaw. This library is used by Rails web applications to integrate with
 OpenID Providers. Severity can range from medium to critical, depending on
 how a web application developer chose to employ the ruby-openid library.
 Developers who based their OpenID integration heavily on the "example app"
 provided by the project are at highest risk.
