 https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-105783
Description:
 Clients may successfully perform a TLS handshake with a MongoDB server
 despite presenting a client certificate not aligning with the documented
 Extended Key Usage (EKU) requirements. A certificate that specifies
 extendedKeyUsage but is missing extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth may still be
 successfully authenticated via the TLS handshake as a client. This issue is
 specific to MongoDB servers running on Windows or Apple as the expected
 validation behavior functions correctly on Linux systems.
 
 Additionally, MongoDB servers may successfully establish egress TLS
 connections with servers that present server certificates not aligning with
 the documented Extended Key Usage (EKU) requirements. A certificate that
 specifies extendedKeyUsage but is missing extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth may
 still be successfully authenticated via the TLS handshake as a server. This
 issue is specific to MongoDB servers running on Apple as the expected
 validation behavior functions correctly on both Linux and Windows systems.
 
 This vulnerability affects MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.26,
 MongoDB Server v8.0 versions prior to 8.0.16 and MongoDB Server v8.2
 versions prior to 8.2.2
