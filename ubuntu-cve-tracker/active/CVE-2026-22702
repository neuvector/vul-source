Description:
 virtualenv is a tool for creating isolated virtual python environments.
 Prior to version 20.36.1, TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use)
 vulnerabilities in virtualenv allow local attackers to perform
 symlink-based attacks on directory creation operations. An attacker with
 local access can exploit a race condition between directory existence
 checks and creation to redirect virtualenv's app_data and lock file
 operations to attacker-controlled locations. This issue has been patched in
 version 20.36.1.
