Description:
 Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started with
 version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host
 `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resource
 which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing HTML
 and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploit
 as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request implies
 that one is already in a privileged position. This issue was fixed in
 version 22.10.0rc1. There are no known workarounds.
