Description:
 cbor2 provides encoding and decoding for the Concise Binary Object
 Representation (CBOR) serialization format. Starting in version 3.0.0 and
 prior to version 5.8.0, whhen a CBORDecoder instance is reused across
 multiple decode operations, values marked with the shareable tag (28)
 persist in memory and can be accessed by subsequent CBOR messages using the
 sharedref tag (29). This allows an attacker-controlled message to read data
 from previously decoded messages if the decoder is reused across trust
 boundaries. Version 5.8.0 patches the issue.
