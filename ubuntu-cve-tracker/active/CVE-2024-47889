Description:
 Action Mailer is a framework for designing email service layers. Starting
 in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and
 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the block_format helper
 in Action Mailer. Carefully crafted text can cause the block_format helper
 to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS
 vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade
 to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant
 patch immediately. As a workaround, users can avoid calling the
 `block_format` helper or upgrade to Ruby 3.2. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for
 this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected.
 Rails 8.0.0.beta1 requires Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.
