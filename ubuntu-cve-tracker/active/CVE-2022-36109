Description:
 Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software
 containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where
 supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct
 access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access,
 they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group
 restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive
 information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. This
 bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be
 stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to
 upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `"USER
 $USERNAME"` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT ["su",
 "-", "user"]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.
