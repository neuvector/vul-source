Description:
 Amavis before 2.12.3 and 2.13.x before 2.13.1, in part because of its use
 of MIME-tools, has an Interpretation Conflict (relative to some mail user
 agents) when there are multiple boundary parameters in a MIME email
 message. Consequently, there can be an incorrect check for banned files or
 malware.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> The d921bc52 commit allows using ambiguous_content from
 mdeslaur> libmime-tools-perl 5.514 if it is available. That version is
 mdeslaur> only in noble+, but the previous commit will still work.
