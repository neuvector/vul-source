Description:
 Amavis before 2.12.3 and 2.13.x before 2.13.1, in part because of its use
 of MIME-tools, has an Interpretation Conflict (relative to some mail user
 agents) when there are multiple boundary parameters in a MIME email
 message. Consequently, there can be an incorrect check for banned files or
 malware.
