Description:
 An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4
 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library
 v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory
 allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory
 corruption. The FOURCC code, 'trik', is parsed by the function within the
 library. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this
 vulnerability.
