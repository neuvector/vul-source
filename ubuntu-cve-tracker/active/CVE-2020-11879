Description:
 An issue was discovered in GNOME Evolution before 3.35.91. By using the
 proprietary (non-RFC6068) "mailto?attach=..." parameter, a website (or
 other source of mailto links) can make Evolution attach local files or
 directories to a composed email message without showing a warning to the
 user, as demonstrated by an attach=. value.
