Description:
 Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager.
 The current implementation of token parsing fails to properly validate CSRF
 tokens when activating or deactivating catalog. This vulnerability allows
 an attacker to exploit CSRF attacks, potentially enabling them to change
 website features that should only be managed by administrators through
 malicious requests. This issue has been addressed in version 7.0.1 and all
 users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
