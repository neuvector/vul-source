Description:
 Drupal 9.3 implemented a generic entity access API for entity revisions.
 However, this API was not completely integrated with existing permissions,
 resulting in some possible access bypass for users who have access to use
 revisions of content generally, but who do not have access to individual
 items of node and media content. This vulnerability only affects sites
 using Drupal's revision system.
