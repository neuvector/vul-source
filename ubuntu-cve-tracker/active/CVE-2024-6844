Description:
 A vulnerability in corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 allows for
 inconsistent CORS matching due to the handling of the '+' character in URL
 paths. The request.path is passed through the unquote_plus function, which
 converts the '+' character to a space ' '. This behavior leads to incorrect
 path normalization, causing potential mismatches in CORS configuration. As
 a result, endpoints may not be matched correctly to their CORS settings,
 leading to unexpected CORS policy application. This can cause unauthorized
 cross-origin access or block valid requests, creating security
 vulnerabilities and usability issues.
