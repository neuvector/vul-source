Description:
 A vulnerability in the CivetWeb library's function mg_handle_form_request
 allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition. By
 sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request containing a null byte in the
 payload, the server enters an infinite loop during form data parsing.
 Multiple malicious requests will result in complete CPU exhaustion and
 render the service unresponsive to further requests.
 
 This issue was fixed in commit 782e189. This issue affects only the
 library, standalone executable pre-built by vendor is not affected.
