Description:
 In Rust time crate from version 0.2.7 and before version 0.2.23, unix-like
 operating systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling pointer in
 specific circumstances. This requires the user to set any environment
 variable in a different thread than the affected functions. The affected
 functions are time::UtcOffset::local_offset_at,
 time::UtcOffset::try_local_offset_at,
 time::UtcOffset::current_local_offset,
 time::UtcOffset::try_current_local_offset, time::OffsetDateTime::now_local
 and time::OffsetDateTime::try_now_local. Non-Unix targets are unaffected.
 This includes Windows and wasm. The issue was introduced in version 0.2.7
 and fixed in version 0.2.23.
