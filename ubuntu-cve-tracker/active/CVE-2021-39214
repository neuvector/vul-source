Description:
 mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In
 mitmproxy 7.0.2 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform
 HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a
 malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy
 as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While a smuggled
 request is still captured as part of another request's body, it does not
 appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy
 event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks
 or input sanitization. Unless one uses mitmproxy to protect an HTTP/1
 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in
 mitmproxy 7.0.3 and above.
