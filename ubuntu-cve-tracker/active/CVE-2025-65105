Description:
 Apptainer is an open source container platform. In Apptainer versions less
 than 1.4.5, a container can disable two of the forms of the little used
 --security option, in particular the forms --security=apparmor:<profile>
 and --security=selinux:<label> which otherwise put restrictions on
 operations that containers can do. The --security option has always been
 mentioned in Apptainer documentation as being a feature for the root user,
 although these forms do also work for unprivileged users on systems where
 the corresponding feature is enabled. Apparmor is enabled by default on
 Debian-based distributions and SElinux is enabled by default on RHEL-based
 distributions, but on SUSE it depends on the distribution version. This
 vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.5.
