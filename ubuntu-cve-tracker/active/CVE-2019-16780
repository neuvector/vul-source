Description:
 WordPress users with lower privileges (like contributors) can inject
 JavaScript code in the block editor using a specific payload, which is
 executed within the dashboard. This can lead to XSS if an admin opens the
 post in the editor. Execution of this attack does require an authenticated
 user. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous
 WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release. Automatic updates
 are enabled by default for minor releases and we strongly recommend that
 you keep them enabled.
