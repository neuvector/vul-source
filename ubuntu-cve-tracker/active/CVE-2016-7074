Description:
 An issue has been found in PowerDNS before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2, and PowerDNS
 recursor before 4.0.4, allowing an attacker in position of
 man-in-the-middle to alter the content of an AXFR because of insufficient
 validation of TSIG signatures. A missing check that the TSIG record is the
 last one, leading to the possibility of parsing records that are not
 covered by the TSIG signature.
