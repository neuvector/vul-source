Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An
 authenticated with sufficient privileges may create a malformed ACL
 selector which, when accessed, triggers a server panic and subsequent
 denial of service. The problem exists in Redis 7 prior to versions 7.2.6
 and 7.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
 this vulnerability.
