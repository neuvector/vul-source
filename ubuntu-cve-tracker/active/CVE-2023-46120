Description:
 The RabbitMQ Java client library allows Java and JVM-based applications to
 connect to and interact with RabbitMQ nodes. `maxBodyLebgth` was not used
 when receiving Message objects.  Attackers could send a very large Message
 causing a memory overflow and triggering an OOM Error. Users of RabbitMQ
 may suffer from  DoS attacks from RabbitMQ Java client which will
 ultimately exhaust the memory of the consumer. This vulnerability was
 patched in version 5.18.0.
