Description:
 The App::cpanminus package 1.7044 for Perl allows Signature Verification
 Bypass.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
Mitigation:
 This issue can be mitigated if cpanminus is only used with trusted
 CPAN mirrors (https://www.cpan.org/ or https://cpan.metacpan.org/), ensuring
 that HTTPS is used for communication with the server.
 cpanm command can be used with --from option to specify the CPAN mirror as in
 'cpnam --from https://www.cpan.org/' or the environment variable PERL_CPANM_OPT
 can be set to "--from https://www.cpan.org".
