Description:
 Versions of the package angular from 1.4.9 are vulnerable to Regular
 Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the <input type="url"> element due
 to the usage of an insecure regular expression in the input[url]
 functionality. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible by a large
 carefully-crafted input, which can result in catastrophic backtracking.
