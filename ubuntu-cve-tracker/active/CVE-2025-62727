Description:
 Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit. Starting in version
 0.39.0 and prior to version 0.49.1 , an unauthenticated attacker can send a
 crafted HTTP Range header that triggers quadratic-time processing in
 Starlette's FileResponse Range parsing/merging logic. This enables CPU
 exhaustion per request, causing denial‑of‑service for endpoints serving
 files (e.g., StaticFiles or any use of FileResponse). This vulnerability is
 fixed in 0.49.1.
