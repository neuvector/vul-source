Description:
 setuptools is a package that allows users to download, build, install,
 upgrade, and uninstall Python packages. A path traversal vulnerability in
 `PackageIndex` is present in setuptools prior to version 78.1.1. An
 attacker would be allowed to write files to arbitrary locations on the
 filesystem with the permissions of the process running the Python code,
 which could escalate to remote code execution depending on the context.
 Version 78.1.1 fixes the issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-setuptools binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-setuptools, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is
 mdeslaur> required. On jammy and later, python-setuptools is bundled in
 mdeslaur> the python-pip package and needs to be patched.
