Description:
 Temporary data passed between application components by Budgie Extras
 Window Shuffler applet could potentially be viewed or manipulated. The data
 is stored in a location that is accessible to any user who has local access
 to the system. Attackers may pre-create and control this file to present
 false information to users or deny access to the application and panel.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Matthias Gerstner discovered that the Window Shuffler application of Budgie
 Extras used predictable temporary file paths which are world editable. An
 attacker could use this to inject false information, read information, or
 deny access to the application.
