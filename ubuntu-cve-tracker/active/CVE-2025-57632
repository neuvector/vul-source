Description:
 libsmb2 6.2+ is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. When processing SMB2 chained
 PDUs (NextCommand), libsmb2 repeatedly calls smb2_add_iovector() to append
 to a fixed-size iovec array without checking the upper bound of v->niov
 (SMB2_MAX_VECTORS=256). An attacker can craft responses with many chained
 PDUs to overflow v->niov and perform heap out-of-bounds writes, causing
 memory corruption, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The
 SMB2_OPLOCK_BREAK path bypasses message ID validation.
