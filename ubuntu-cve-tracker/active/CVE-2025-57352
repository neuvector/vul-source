Description:
 A vulnerability exists in the 'min-document' package prior to version
 2.19.0, stemming from improper handling of namespace operations in the
 removeAttributeNS method. By processing malicious input involving the
 __proto__ property, an attacker can manipulate the prototype chain of
 JavaScript objects, leading to denial of service or arbitrary code
 execution. This issue arises from insufficient validation of attribute
 namespace removal operations, allowing unintended modification of critical
 object prototypes. The vulnerability remains unaddressed in the latest
 available version.
