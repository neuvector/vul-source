Description:
 Guests can cause Xenstore crash via soft reset When a guest issues a "Soft
 Reset" (e.g. for performing a kexec) the libxl based Xen toolstack will
 normally perform a XS_RELEASE Xenstore operation. Due to a bug in xenstored
 this can result in a crash of xenstored. Any other use of XS_RELEASE will
 have the same impact.
