Description:
 openCryptoki is a PKCS#11 library and tools for Linux and AIX. In 3.25.0
 and 3.26.0, there is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the
 CKM_ECDH_AES_KEY_WRAP implementation allows an attacker with local access
 to cause out-of-bounds writes in the host process by supplying a compressed
 EC public key and invoking C_WrapKey. This can lead to heap corruption, or
 denial-of-service.
