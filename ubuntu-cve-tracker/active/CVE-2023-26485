Description:
 cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering
 library and program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm
 may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.
 This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when parsing text which leads
 with either large numbers of `_` characters. This issue has been addressed
 in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
 upgrade should validate that their input comes from trusted sources. ###
 Impact A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to
 unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. ### Proof
 of concept ``` $ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c 'pad = "_" * 100000; print(pad +
 "." + pad, end="")' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext ```
 Increasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time
 to increase quadratically. ### Patches This vulnerability have been patched
 in 0.29.0.gfm.10. ### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm XXX: TBD
 [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) is a fork of
 [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the GitHub Flavored
 Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over time, but share a
 common core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`. ### Credit We
 would like to thank @gravypod for reporting this vulnerability. ###
