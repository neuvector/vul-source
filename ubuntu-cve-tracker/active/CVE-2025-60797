 https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin/blob/master/dataexport.php#L118
Description:
 phpPgAdmin 7.13.0 and earlier contains a SQL injection vulnerability in
 dataexport.php at line 118. The application directly executes user-supplied
 SQL queries from the $_REQUEST['query'] parameter without any sanitization
 or parameterization via $data->conn->Execute($_REQUEST['query']). An
 authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
 SQL commands, potentially leading to complete database compromise, data
 theft, or privilege escalation.
