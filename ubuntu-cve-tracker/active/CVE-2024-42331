 https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-25627
Description:
 In the src/libs/zbxembed/browser.c file, the es_browser_ctor method
 retrieves a heap pointer from the Duktape JavaScript engine. This heap
 pointer is subsequently utilized by the browser_push_error method in the
 src/libs/zbxembed/browser_error.c file. A use-after-free bug can occur at
 this stage if the wd->browser heap pointer is freed by garbage collection.
