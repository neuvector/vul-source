Description:
 Design document functions which receive a user http request object may
 expose authorization or session cookie headers of the user who accesses the
 document. These design document functions are: * list * show * rewrite *
 update An attacker can leak the session component using an HTML-like
 output, insert the session as an external resource (such as an image), or
 store the credential in a _local document with an "update" function. For
 the attack to succeed the attacker has to be able to insert the design
 documents into the database, then manipulate a user to access a function
 from that design document. Workaround: Avoid using design documents from
 untrusted sources which may attempt to access or manipulate request
 object's headers
