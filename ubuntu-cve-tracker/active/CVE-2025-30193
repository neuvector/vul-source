Description:
 In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to allow an unlimited
 number of queries on a single, incoming TCP connection from a client, an
 attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a TCP exchange that
 triggers an exhaustion of the stack and a crash of DNSdist, causing a
 denial of service.
 
 The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.10 version.
 
 A workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP
 connections to a safe value, like 50, via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection
 setting.
 
 We would like to thank Renaud Allard for bringing this issue to our
 attention.
