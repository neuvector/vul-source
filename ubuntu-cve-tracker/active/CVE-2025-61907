Description:
 Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system. In Icinga 2 versions 2.4
 through 2.15.0, filter expressions provided to the various /v1/objects
 endpoints could access variables or objects that would otherwise be
 inaccessible for the user. This allows authenticated API users to learn
 information that should be hidden from them, including global variables not
 permitted by the variables permission and objects not permitted by the
 corresponding objects/query permissions. The vulnerability is fixed in
 versions 2.15.1, 2.14.7, and 2.13.13.
