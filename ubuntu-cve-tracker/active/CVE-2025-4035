Description:
 A flaw was found in libsoup. When handling cookies, libsoup clients
 mistakenly allow cookies to be set for public suffix domains if the domain
 contains at least two components and includes an uppercase character. This
 bypasses public suffix protections and could allow a malicious website to
 set cookies for domains it does not own, potentially leading to integrity
 issues such as session fixation.
