Description:
 mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache
 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party,
 authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In versions prior
 to 2.4.9.4, the 3rd-party init SSO functionality of mod_auth_openidc was
 reported to be vulnerable to an open redirect attack by supplying a crafted
 URL in the `target_link_uri` parameter. A patch in version 2.4.9.4 made it
 so that the `OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed` setting must be applied to the
 `target_link_uri` parameter. There are no known workarounds aside from
 upgrading to a patched version.
