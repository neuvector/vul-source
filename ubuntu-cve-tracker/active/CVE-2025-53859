Description:
 NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus have a vulnerability in the
 ngx_mail_smtp_module that might allow an unauthenticated attacker to
 over-read NGINX SMTP authentication process memory; as a result, the server
 side may leak arbitrary bytes sent in a request to the authentication
 server. This issue happens during the NGINX SMTP authentication process and
 requires the attacker to make preparations against the target system to
 extract the leaked data. The issue affects NGINX only if (1) it is built
 with the ngx_mail_smtp_module, (2) the smtp_auth directive is configured
 with method "none," and (3) the authentication server returns the
 "Auth-Wait" response header.
