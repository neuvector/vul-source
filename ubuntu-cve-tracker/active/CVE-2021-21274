Description:
 Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package
 matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant
 Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious
 homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large
 file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will
 consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file
 of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation
 requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a
 workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to
 restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.
