Description:
 The tokenizer incorrectly interprets tags with unquoted attribute values
 that end with a solidus character (/) as self-closing. When directly using
 Tokenizer, this can result in such tags incorrectly being marked as
 self-closing, and when using the Parse functions, this can result in
 content following such tags as being placed in the wrong scope during DOM
 construction, but only when tags are in foreign content (e.g. <math>,
 <svg>, etc contexts).
