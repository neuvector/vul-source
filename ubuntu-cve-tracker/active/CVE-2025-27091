Description:
 OpenH264 Decoding Functions Heap Overflow Vulnerability
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This package provides two binary packages, a library that was
 mdeslaur> built from source, which we can patch, and a binary package that
 mdeslaur> has a script that downloads the matching binary library from
 mdeslaur> cisco which comes with a patent license.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> To get a fixed matching binary library from Cisco, it is
 mdeslaur> necessary to update the package to 2.6.0.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> But, in Ubuntu, nothing requires the Cisco library as Chromium
 mdeslaur> is not shipped as a deb, it is shipped as a snap, so we do not
 mdeslaur> need to actually fix the Cisco library, so the patch below can
 mdeslaur> simply be backported to stable releases.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Debian added a note to their package to clarify that the Cisco
 mdeslaur> library in stable releases contains a security issue which we
 mdeslaur> should also do if backporting the commit below. See Debian bug
 mdeslaur> for more details.
