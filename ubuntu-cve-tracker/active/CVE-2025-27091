Description:
 OpenH264 is a free license codec library which supports H.264 encoding and
 decoding. A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec
 library could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a heap
 overflow. This vulnerability is due to a race condition between a Sequence
 Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous
 Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory
 usage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious
 bitstream and tricking a victim user into processing an arbitrary video
 containing the malicious bistream. An exploit could allow the attacker to
 cause an unexpected crash in the victim's user decoding client and,
 possibly, perform arbitrary commands on the victim's host by abusing the
 heap overflow. This vulnerability affects OpenH264 2.5.0 and earlier
 releases. Both Scalable Video Coding (SVC) mode and Advanced Video Coding
 (AVC) mode are affected by this vulnerability. OpenH264 software releases
 2.6.0 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability. Users are advised
 to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This package provides two binary packages, a library that was
 mdeslaur> built from source, which we can patch, and a binary package that
 mdeslaur> has a script that downloads the matching binary library from
 mdeslaur> cisco which comes with a patent license.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> To get a fixed matching binary library from Cisco, it is
 mdeslaur> necessary to update the package to 2.6.0.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> But, in Ubuntu, nothing requires the Cisco library as Chromium
 mdeslaur> is not shipped as a deb, it is shipped as a snap, so we do not
 mdeslaur> need to actually fix the Cisco library, so the patch below can
 mdeslaur> simply be backported to stable releases.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Debian added a note to their package to clarify that the Cisco
 mdeslaur> library in stable releases contains a security issue which we
 mdeslaur> should also do if backporting the commit below. See Debian bug
 mdeslaur> for more details.
