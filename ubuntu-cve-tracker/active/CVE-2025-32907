Description:
 A flaw was found in libsoup. The implementation of HTTP range requests is
 vulnerable to a resource consumption attack. This flaw allows a malicious
 client to request the same range many times in a single HTTP request,
 causing the server to use large amounts of memory. This does not allow for
 a full denial of service.
