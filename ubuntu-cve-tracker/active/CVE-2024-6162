Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where URL-encoded request paths can
 be mishandled during concurrent requests on the AJP listener. This issue
 arises because the same buffer is used to decode the paths for multiple
 requests simultaneously, leading to incorrect path information being
 processed. As a result, the server may attempt to access the wrong path,
 causing errors such as "404 Not Found" or other application failures. This
 flaw can potentially lead to a denial of service, as legitimate resources
 become inaccessible due to the path mix-up.
