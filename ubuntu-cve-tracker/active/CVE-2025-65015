Description:
 joserfc is a Python library that provides an implementation of several JSON
 Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) standards. In versions from 1.3.3 to
 before 1.3.5 and from 1.4.0 to before 1.4.2, the ExceededSizeError
 exception messages are embedded with non-decoded JWT token parts and may
 cause Python logging to record an arbitrarily large, forged JWT payload. In
 situations where a misconfigured — or entirely absent — production-grade
 web server sits in front of a Python web application, an attacker may be
 able to send arbitrarily large bearer tokens in the HTTP request headers.
 When this occurs, Python logging or diagnostic tools (e.g., Sentry) may end
 up processing extremely large log messages containing the full JWT header
 during the joserfc.jwt.decode() operation. The same behavior also appears
 when validating claims and signature payload sizes, as the library raises
 joserfc.errors.ExceededSizeError() with the full payload embedded in the
 exception message. Since the payload is already fully loaded into memory at
 this stage, the library cannot prevent or reject it. This issue has been
 patched in versions 1.3.5 and 1.4.2.
