Description:
 The implementation of PEAP in wpa_supplicant through 2.10 allows
 authentication bypass. For a successful attack, wpa_supplicant must be
 configured to not verify the network's TLS certificate during Phase 1
 authentication, and an eap_peap_decrypt vulnerability can then be abused to
 skip Phase 2 authentication. The attack vector is sending an EAP-TLV
 Success packet instead of starting Phase 2. This allows an adversary to
 impersonate Enterprise Wi-Fi networks.

 mdeslaur> Commit listed in this CVE is only a workaround for certain

 mdeslaur> Marking wpa in this CVE as deferred as there is no fix
 mdeslaur> available.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Front-end components that generate bad configuration files
 mdeslaur> should be added to this CVE if any are discovered.
