Description:
 Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.21.2 contains a memory leak vulnerability in
 /krb5/src/kdc/ndr.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> per upstream: "The ndr.c leak also affects an encoding function,
 mdeslaur> and triggers if the input contains invalid UTF-8.  This one
 mdeslaur> might be triggerable by a request (though it may require
 mdeslaur> elevated privilege), but I would not have requested a CVE for
 mdeslaur> it myself."
