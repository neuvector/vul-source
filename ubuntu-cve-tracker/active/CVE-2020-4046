Description:
 In affected versions of WordPress, users with low privileges (like
 contributors and authors) can use the embed block in a certain way to
 inject unfiltered HTML in the block editor. When affected posts are viewed
 by a higher privileged user, this could lead to script execution in the
 editor/wp-admin. This has been patched in version 5.4.2, along with all the
 previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6,
 5.0.10, 4.9.15, 4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19, 4.5.22, 4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28,
 4.1.31, 4.0.31, 3.9.32, 3.8.34, 3.7.34).
