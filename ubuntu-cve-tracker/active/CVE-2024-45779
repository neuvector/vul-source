Description:
 An integer overflow flaw was found in the BFS file system driver in grub2.
 When reading a file with an indirect extent map, grub2 fails to validate
 the number of extent entries to be read. A crafted or corrupted BFS
 filesystem may cause an integer overflow during the file reading, leading
 to a heap of bounds read. As a consequence, sensitive data may be leaked,
 or grub2 will crash.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
