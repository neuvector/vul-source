Description:
 Out-of-bounds array write in Xpdf 4.05 and earlier, triggered by an invalid
 character code in a Type 1 font. The root problem was a bounds check that
 was being optimized away by modern compilers.
 
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> In trusty to bionic, xpdf is built with poppler as the backend
 mdeslaur> library, so most xpdf issues don't apply to it. In jammy and
 mdeslaur> later, the xpdf package is actually xpopple, a fork that also
 mdeslaur> builds against poppler.
