Description:
 A flaw was found in OpenSC packages that allow a potential PIN bypass. When
 a token/card is authenticated by one process, it can perform cryptographic
 operations in other processes when an empty zero-length pin is passed. This
 issue poses a security risk, particularly for OS logon/screen unlock and
 for small, permanently connected tokens to computers. Additionally, the
 token can internally track login status. This flaw allows an attacker to
 gain unauthorized access, carry out malicious actions, or compromise the
 system without the user's awareness.
