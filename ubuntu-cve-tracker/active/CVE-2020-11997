Description:
 Apache Guacamole 1.2.0 and earlier do not consistently restrict access to
 connection history based on user visibility. If multiple users share access
 to the same connection, those users may be able to see which other users
 have accessed that connection, as well as the IP addresses from which that
 connection was accessed, even if those users do not otherwise have
 permission to see other users.
