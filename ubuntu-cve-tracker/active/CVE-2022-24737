Description:
 HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of
 sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that
 belongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for
 further usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didnâ€˜t distinguish between cookies and
 hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies
 when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party
 website. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.
