Description:
 aiosmtpd is a reimplementation of the Python stdlib smtpd.py based on
 asyncio. aiosmtpd is vulnerable to inbound SMTP smuggling. SMTP smuggling
 is a novel vulnerability based on not so novel interpretation differences
 of the SMTP protocol. By exploiting SMTP smuggling, an attacker may send
 smuggle/spoof e-mails with fake sender addresses, allowing advanced
 phishing attacks. This issue is also existed in other SMTP software like
 Postfix. With the right SMTP server constellation, an attacker can send
 spoofed e-mails to inbound/receiving aiosmtpd instances. This issue has
 been addressed in version 1.4.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this vulnerability.
