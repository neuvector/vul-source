Description:
 A flaw was found in the Ansible Automation Platform. When creating a new
 keypair, the ec2_key module prints out the private key directly to the
 standard output. This flaw allows an attacker to fetch those keys from the
 log files, compromising the system's confidentiality, integrity, and
 availability.
