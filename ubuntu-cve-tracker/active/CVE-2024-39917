Description:
 xrdp is an open source RDP server. xrdp versions prior to 0.10.0 have a
 vulnerability that allows attackers to make an infinite number of login
 attempts. The number of max login attempts is supposed to be  limited by a
 configuration parameter `MaxLoginRetry` in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini`. However,
 this mechanism was not effectively working. As a result, xrdp allows an
 infinite number of login attempts.
