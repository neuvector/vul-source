Description:
 In affected versions of WordPress, files with a specially crafted name when
 uploaded to the Media section can lead to script execution upon accessing
 the file. This requires an authenticated user with privileges to upload
 files. This has been patched in version 5.4.1, along with all the
 previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.3, 5.2.6, 5.1.5,
 5.0.9, 4.9.14, 4.8.13, 4.7.17, 4.6.18, 4.5.21, 4.4.22, 4.3.23, 4.2.27,
