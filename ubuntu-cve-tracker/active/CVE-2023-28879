Description:
 In Artifex Ghostscript through 10.01.0, there is a buffer overflow leading
 to potential corruption of data internal to the PostScript interpreter, in
 base/sbcp.c. This affects BCPEncode, BCPDecode, TBCPEncode, and TBCPDecode.
 If the write buffer is filled to one byte less than full, and one then
 tries to write an escaped character, two bytes are written.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> additional hardening upstream in commit 3635f4c75e
   ("PostScript filters - remove non-standard filters when SAFER is true")
   consider applying as part of security fix
 rodrigo-zaiden> hardening commit, 3635f4c75e, removes filters that are
   required for the old PDF interpreter written in PostScript. the new PDF
   interpreter written in C, is enabled by default in ghostscript 9.56.1.
   so, the hardening can break certain operations in older versions. in
   Ubuntu, the hardening is not applied is releases older than kinetic.
