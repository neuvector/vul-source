Description:
 ViewVC, a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control
 repositories, as a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affects versions
 prior to 1.2.2 and 1.1.29. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by
 the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion
 repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack
 vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an
 HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which
 themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least
 version 1.2.2 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.29 (if
 they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so
 users of that release lineage should implement a workaround. Users can edit
 their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed paths
 during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file
 references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format "html"]` and
 `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.path]`
 will become `[format "html"][changes.path][end]`. (This workaround should
 be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else changed
 path names will be doubly escaped.)
