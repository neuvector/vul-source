Description:
 A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability was found in libblockdev.
 Generally, the "allow_active" setting in Polkit permits a physically
 present user to take certain actions based on the session type. Due to the
 way libblockdev interacts with the udisks daemon, an "allow_active" user on
 a system may be able escalate to full root privileges on the target host.
 Normally, udisks mounts user-provided filesystem images with security flags
 like nosuid and nodev to prevent privilege escalation.  However, a local
 attacker can create a specially crafted XFS image containing a SUID-root
 shell, then trick udisks into resizing it. This mounts their malicious
 filesystem with root privileges, allowing them to execute their SUID-root
 shell and gain complete control of the system.
