Description:
 In Suricata before 6.0.13 (when there is an adversary who controls an
 external source of rules), a dataset filename, that comes from a rule, may
 trigger absolute or relative directory traversal, and lead to write access
 to a local filesystem. This is addressed in 6.0.13 by requiring
 allow-absolute-filenames and allow-write (in the datasets rules
 configuration section) if an installation requires traversal/writing in
 this situation.
