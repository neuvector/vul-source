Description:
 WordPress before 5.8 lacks support for the Update URI plugin header. This
 makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
 supply-chain attack against WordPress installations that use any plugin for
 which the slug satisfies the naming constraints of the WordPress.org Plugin
 Directory but is not yet present in that directory.
