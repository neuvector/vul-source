Description:
 PVH guests have their ACPI tables constructed by the toolstack.  The
 construction involves building the tables in local memory, which are
 then copied into guest memory.  While actually used parts of the local
 memory are filled in correctly, excess space that is being allocated is
 left with its prior contents.
