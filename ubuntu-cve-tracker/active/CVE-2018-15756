Description:
 Spring Framework, version 5.1, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.10, versions
 4.3.x prior to 4.3.20, and older unsupported versions on the 4.2.x branch
 provide support for range requests when serving static resources through
 the ResourceHttpRequestHandler, or starting in 5.0 when an annotated
 controller returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource. A malicious
 user (or attacker) can add a range header with a high number of ranges, or
 with wide ranges that overlap, or both, for a denial of service attack.
 This vulnerability affects applications that depend on either spring-webmvc
 or spring-webflux. Such applications must also have a registration for
 serving static resources (e.g. JS, CSS, images, and others), or have an
 annotated controller that returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource.
 Spring Boot applications that depend on spring-boot-starter-web or
 spring-boot-starter-webflux are ready to serve static resources out of the
 box and are therefore vulnerable.
