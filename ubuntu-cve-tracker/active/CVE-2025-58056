Description:
 Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for
 development of maintainable high performance protocol servers and clients.
 In versions 4.1.124.Final, and 4.2.0.Alpha3 through 4.2.4.Final, Netty
 incorrectly accepts standalone newline characters (LF) as a chunk-size line
 terminator, regardless of a preceding carriage return (CR), instead of
 requiring CRLF per HTTP/1.1 standards. When combined with reverse proxies
 that parse LF differently (treating it as part of the chunk extension),
 attackers can craft requests that the proxy sees as one request but Netty
 processes as two, enabling request smuggling attacks. This is fixed in
 versions 4.1.125.Final and 4.2.5.Final.
