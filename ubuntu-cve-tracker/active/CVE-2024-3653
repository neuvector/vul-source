Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling the
 learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default,
 leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1,
 which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the
 server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach
 the server with a normal HTTP request.
