Description:
 A flaw was found in glib. An integer overflow during temporary file
 creation leads to an out-of-bounds memory access, allowing an attacker to
 potentially perform path traversal or access private temporary file content
 by creating symbolic links. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to
 manipulate file paths and access unauthorized data. The core issue stems
 from insufficient validation of file path lengths during temporary file
 operations.
