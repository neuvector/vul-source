 https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/issues/321
Description:
 The ECDSA implementation of the Elliptic package generates incorrect
 signatures if an interim value of 'k' (as computed based on step 3.2 of
 RFC 6979 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979 ) has leading zeros
 and is susceptible to cryptanalysis, which can lead to secret key exposure.
 This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed,
 resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate
 transactions or communications will be broken as a result. Furthermore, due
 to the nature of the fault, attackers could–under certain conditions–derive
 the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature
 generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for
 the same inputs.
 
 This issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing,
 versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).
