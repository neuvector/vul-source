Description:
 A YAML deserialization vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating
 System (ROS) 'dynparam', a command-line tool for getting, setting, and
 deleting parameters of a dynamically configurable node, affecting ROS
 distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by the use of the
 yaml.load() function in the 'set' and 'get' verbs, and allows for the
 creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote
 user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code. This issue has now been
 fixed for ROS Noetic via commit 3d93ac13603438323d7e9fa74e879e45c5fe2e8e.
