Description:
 oFono QMI SMS Handling Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose
 sensitive information on affected installations of oFono. Authentication is
 not required to exploit this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the processing of SMS message lists. The
 issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
 which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker
 can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute
 arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-23157.
