Description:
 This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy
 handshake. When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5
 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by
 curl itself, the maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes. If the
 host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name resolving
 and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug, the local
 variable that means "let the host resolve the name" could get the wrong
 value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy
 the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the
 resolved address there. The target buffer being a heap based buffer, and
 the host name coming from the URL that curl has been told to operate with.
