Description:
 BlueZ Phone Book Access Profile Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent
 attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of BlueZ.
 User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
 target must connect to a malicious Bluetooth device. The specific flaw
 exists within the handling of the Phone Book Access profile. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
 data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker
 can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was
 ZDI-CAN-20939.
