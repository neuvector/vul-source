Description:
 Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition
 product of Oracle Java SE (component: Serialization). Supported versions
 that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 8u351, 8u351-perf; Oracle GraalVM
 Enterprise Edition: 20.3.8 and 21.3.4. Easily exploitable vulnerability
 allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols
 to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful
 attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or
 delete access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition
 accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
 typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
 sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
 comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
 that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.3 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did
 not properly handle the deserialization of some CORBA objects. An
 attacker could possibly use this to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> only affects openjdk-8
 sbeattie| from the upstream release notes: The readObject method of
   _DynAnyFactoryStub has been amended, such that, when reading the
   stringified IOR from serialized data, it will, by default, accept
   stringified IORs in IOR: URI format, only. As DynAnyFactory is a
   locally or ORB constrained type, it is not useful that serialized data
   should contain corbaname or corbaloc URIs. Furthermore, an ORB will
   prohibit the binding of a name in the INS to a DynAnyFactory IOR, as
   such, using a corbaname to reference an instance of DynAnyFactory is
   not meaningful.
