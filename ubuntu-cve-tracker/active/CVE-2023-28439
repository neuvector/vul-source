Description:
 CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A
 cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting Iframe
 Dialog and Media Embed packages. The vulnerability may trigger a JavaScript
 code after fulfilling special conditions: using one of the affected
 packages on a web page with missing proper Content Security Policy
 configuration; initializing the editor on an element and using an element
 other than `<textarea>` as a base; and destroying the editor instance. This
 vulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators that depend on
 dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism. A fix is available in
 CKEditor4 version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may be
 considered a breaking change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the Iframe
 Dialog plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts
 JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this behavior,
 configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also starting from version
 4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed
 widget by default. To change this behavior, configure the
 `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option. Those who choose to enable
 either of the more permissive options or who cannot upgrade to a patched
 version should properly configure Content Security Policy to avoid any
 potential security issues that may arise from embedding iframe elements on
 their web page.
