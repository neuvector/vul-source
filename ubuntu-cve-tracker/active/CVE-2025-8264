Description:
 Versions of the package z-push/z-push-dev before 2.7.6 are vulnerable to
 SQL Injection due to unparameterized queries in the IMAP backend. An
 attacker can inject malicious commands by manipulating the username field
 in basic authentication. This allows the attacker to access and potentially
 modify or delete sensitive data from a linked third-party database. 
 **Note:** This vulnerability affects Z-Push installations that utilize the
 IMAP backend and have the IMAP_FROM_SQL_QUERY option configured.  
 Mitigation Change configuration to use the default or LDAP in
 backend/imap/config.php  php define('IMAP_DEFAULTFROM', '');  or php
 define('IMAP_DEFAULTFROM', 'ldap');
