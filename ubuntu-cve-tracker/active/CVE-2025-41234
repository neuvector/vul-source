 Description
 
 In Spring Framework, versions 6.0.x as of 6.0.5, versions 6.1.x and 6.2.x,
 an application is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack when
 it sets a “Content-Disposition” header with a non-ASCII charset, where the
 filename attribute is derived from user-supplied input.
 
 Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all the following are true:
 
   *  The header is prepared with
 org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition.
   *  The filename is set via ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String,
 Charset).
   *  The value for the filename is derived from user-supplied input.
   *  The application does not sanitize the user-supplied input.
   *  The downloaded content of the response is injected with malicious
 commands by the attacker (see RFD paper reference for details).
 
 
 An application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:
 
   *  The application does not set a “Content-Disposition” response header.
   *  The header is not prepared with
 org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition.
   *  The filename is set via one of:  *
 ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String), or
   *  ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, ASCII)
 
 
 
   *  The filename is not derived from user-supplied input.
   *  The filename is derived from user-supplied input but sanitized by the
 application.
   *  The attacker cannot inject malicious content in the downloaded content
 of the response.
 
 
 Affected Spring Products and VersionsSpring Framework:
 
   *  6.2.0 - 6.2.7
   *  6.1.0 - 6.1.20
   *  6.0.5 - 6.0.28
   *  Older, unsupported versions are not affected
 
 
 MitigationUsers of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding
 fixed version.
