Description:
 A flaw was found in the VirGL virtual OpenGL renderer (virglrenderer). The
 virgl did not properly initialize memory when allocating a host-backed
 memory resource. A malicious guest could use this flaw to mmap from the
 guest kernel and read this uninitialized memory from the host, possibly
 leading to information disclosure.
