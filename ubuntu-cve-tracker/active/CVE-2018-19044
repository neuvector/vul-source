Description:
 keepalived 2.0.8 didn't check for pathnames with symlinks when writing data
 to a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. This allowed
 local users to overwrite arbitrary files if fs.protected_symlinks is set to
 0, as demonstrated by a symlink from /tmp/keepalived.data or
 /tmp/keepalived.stats to /etc/passwd.
