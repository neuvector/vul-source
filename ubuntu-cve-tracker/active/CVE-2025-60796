Description:
 phpPgAdmin 7.13.0 and earlier contains multiple cross-site scripting (XSS)
 vulnerabilities across various components. User-supplied input from
 $_REQUEST parameters is reflected in HTML output without proper encoding or
 sanitization in multiple locations including sequences.php, indexes.php,
 admin.php, and other unspecified files. An attacker can exploit these
 vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers,
 potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or other
 malicious actions.
