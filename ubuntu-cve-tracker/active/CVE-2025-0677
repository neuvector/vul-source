Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup, the grub's UFS
 module checks the inode's data size to allocate the internal buffer to read
 the file content, however, it fails to check if the symlink data size has
 overflown. When this occurs, grub_malloc() may be called with a smaller
 value than needed. When further reading the data from the disk into the
 buffer, the grub_ufs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the end of
 the allocated size. An attack can leverage this by crafting a malicious
 filesystem, and as a result, it will corrupt data stored in the heap,
 allowing for arbitrary code execution used to by-pass secure boot
 mechanisms.

Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
