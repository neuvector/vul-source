 https://github.com/jjjake/internetarchive/releases/tag/v5.5.1
Description:
 internetarchive is a Python and Command-Line Interface to Archive.org In
 versions 5.5.0 and below, there is a directory traversal (path traversal)
 vulnerability in the File.download() method of the internetarchive library.
 The file.download() method does not properly sanitize user-supplied
 filenames or validate the final download path. A maliciously crafted
 filename could contain path traversal sequences (e.g.,
 ../../../../windows/system32/file.txt) or illegal characters that, when
 processed, would cause the file to be written outside of the intended
 target directory. An attacker could potentially overwrite critical system
 files or application configuration files, leading to a denial of service,
 privilege escalation, or remote code execution, depending on the context in
 which the library is used.  The vulnerability is particularly critical for
 users on Windows systems, but all operating systems are affected. This
 issue is fixed in version 5.5.1.
