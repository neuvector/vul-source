Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Nothings stb up to f056911. It has been
 declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function
 stbhw_build_tileset_from_image. The manipulation of the argument
 h_count/v_count leads to out-of-bounds read. The attack can be launched
 remotely. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide
 continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated
 releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this
 disclosure but did not respond in any way.
