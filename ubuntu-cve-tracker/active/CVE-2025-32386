Description:
 Helm is a tool for managing Charts. A chart archive file can be crafted in
 a manner where it expands to be significantly larger uncompressed than
 compressed (e.g., >800x difference). When Helm loads this specially crafted
 chart, memory can be exhausted causing the application to terminate. This
 issue has been resolved in Helm v3.17.3.
