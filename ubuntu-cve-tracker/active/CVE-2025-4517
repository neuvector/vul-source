Description:
 Allows arbitrary filesystem writes outside the extraction directory during
 extraction with filter="data".
 
 
 You are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to
 extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall() or
 TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of "data" or
 "tar". See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation
 https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter
  for more information. Only Python versions 3.12 or later are affected by
 these vulnerabilities, earlier versions don't include the extraction filter
 feature.
 
 Note that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed
 from "no filtering" to `"data", so if you are relying on this new default
 behavior then your usage is also affected.
 
 Note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the
 installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source
 distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build
 process. However when evaluating source distributions it's important to
 avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.
