Description:
 A flaw was found in newlib in versions prior to 4.0.0. Improper overflow
 validation in the memory allocation functions mEMALIGn, pvALLOc,
 nano_memalign, nano_valloc, nano_pvalloc could case an integer overflow,
 leading to an allocation of a small buffer and then to a heap-based buffer
 overflow.

Notes:
 eslerm| fixed for newlib-4.0.0 on 2020-11-17 with aa106b29a
  ("malloc/nano-malloc: correctly check for out-of-bounds
  allocation reqs")
