Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. The PCI passthrough code
 improperly uses register data. Code paths in Xen's MSI handling have been
 identified that act on unsanitized values read back from device hardware
 registers. While devices strictly compliant with PCI specifications
 shouldn't be able to affect these registers, experience shows that it's
 very common for devices to have out-of-spec "backdoor" operations that can
 affect the result of these reads. A not fully trusted guest may be able to
 crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system.
 Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. All versions
 of Xen supporting PCI passthrough are affected. Only x86 systems are
 vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only guests with passed through
 PCI devices may be able to leverage the vulnerability. Only systems passing
 through devices with out-of-spec ("backdoor") functionality can cause
 issues. Experience shows that such out-of-spec functionality is common;
 unless you have reason to believe that your device does not have such
 functionality, it's better to assume that it does.
