Description:
 plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_crypto_openssl.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5)
 through 1.15.2 mishandles Distinguished Name (DN) fields, which allows
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
 (buffer overflow and application crash) in situations involving untrusted
 X.509 data, related to the get_matching_data and X509_NAME_oneline_ex
 functions. NOTE: this has security relevance only in use cases outside of
 the MIT Kerberos distribution, e.g., the use of get_matching_data in KDC
 certauth plugin code that is specific to Red Hat.
