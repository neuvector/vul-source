Description:
 A flaw was found in the Keylime registrar that could allow a bypass of the
 challenge-response protocol during agent registration. This issue may allow
 an attacker to impersonate an agent and hide the true status of a monitored
 machine if the fake agent is added to the verifier list by a legitimate
 user, resulting in a breach of the integrity of the registrar database.
