Description:
 Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users
 issuing specially crafted `SETRANGE` and `SORT(_RO)` commands can trigger
 an integer overflow, resulting with Redis attempting to allocate impossible
 amounts of memory and abort with an out-of-memory (OOM) panic. The problem
 is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.8, 6.2.9 and 6.0.17. Users are advised to
 upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
