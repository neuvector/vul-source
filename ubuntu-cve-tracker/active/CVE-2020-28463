Description:
 All versions of package reportlab are vulnerable to Server-side Request
 Forgery (SSRF) via img tags. In order to reduce risk, use trustedSchemes &
 trustedHosts (see in Reportlab's documentation) Steps to reproduce by Karan
 Bamal: 1. Download and install the latest package of reportlab 2. Go to
 demos -> odyssey -> dodyssey 3. In the text file odyssey.txt that needs to
 be converted to pdf inject <img src="http://127.0.0.1:5000" valign="top"/>
 4. Create a nc listener nc -lp 5000 5. Run python3 dodyssey.py 6. You will
 get a hit on your nc showing we have successfully proceded to send a server
 side request 7. dodyssey.py will show error since there is no img file on
 the url, but we are able to do SSRF
