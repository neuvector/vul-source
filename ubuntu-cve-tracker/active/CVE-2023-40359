Description:
 xterm before 380 supports ReGIS reporting for character-set names even if
 they have unexpected characters (i.e., neither alphanumeric nor
 underscore), aka a pointer/overflow issue. This can only occur for xterm
 installations that are configured at compile time to use a certain
 experimental feature.
