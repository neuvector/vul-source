Description:
 FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on
 standard Python type hints. FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used
 cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads
 sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
 attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the
 request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to
 application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g.
 application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain
 containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be
 extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS
 preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute
 them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON
 string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This
 is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if
 the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible
 media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest
 FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency
 that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not
 application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a
 mitigating workaround.
