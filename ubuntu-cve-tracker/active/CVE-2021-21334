Description:
 In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions
 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI
 implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container
 client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may
 receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined
 for other containers. If the affected containers have different security
 contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally
 shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one
 of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue.
 If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the
 same image which have different environment variables, you are not
 vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or
 Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced
 likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been
 fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to
 these versions.
