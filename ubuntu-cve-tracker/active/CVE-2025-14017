Description:
 When doing multi-threaded LDAPS transfers (LDAP over TLS) with libcurl,
 changing TLS options in one thread would inadvertently change them globally
 and therefore possibly also affect other concurrently setup transfers.
 
 Disabling certificate verification for a specific transfer could
 unintentionally disable the feature for other threads as well.
