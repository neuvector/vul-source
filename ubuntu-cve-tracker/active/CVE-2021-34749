Description:
 A vulnerability in Server Name Identification (SNI) request filtering of
 Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD),
 and the Snort detection engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote
 attacker to bypass filtering technology on an affected device and
 exfiltrate data from a compromised host. This vulnerability is due to
 inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability by using data from the SSL client hello packet to communicate
 with an external server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
 execute a command-and-control attack on a compromised host and perform
 additional data exfiltration attacks.
