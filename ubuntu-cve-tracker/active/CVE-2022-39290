Description:
 ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software
 application. In affected versions authenticated users can bypass CSRF keys
 by modifying the request supplied to the Zoneminder web application. These
 modifications include replacing HTTP POST with an HTTP GET and removing the
 CSRF key from the request. An attacker can take advantage of this by using
 an HTTP GET request to perform actions with no CSRF protection. This could
 allow an attacker to cause an authenticated user to perform unexpected
 actions on the web application. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as
 possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
