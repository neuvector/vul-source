Description:
 vmm-sys-util is a collection of modules that provides helpers and utilities
 used by multiple rust-vmm components. Starting in version 0.5.0 and prior
 to version 0.12.0, an issue in the `FamStructWrapper::deserialize`
 implementation provided by the crate for
 `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` can lead to out of bounds memory
 accesses. The deserialization does not check that the length stored in the
 header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths might
 allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods. The issue was
 corrected in version 0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths
 of compared flexible arrays are equal for any deserialized header and
 aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover, the API was changed so that
 header length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures
 that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds memory access from Rust-safe code.
