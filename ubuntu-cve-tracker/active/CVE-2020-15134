Description:
 Faye before version 1.4.0, there is a lack of certification validation in
 TLS handshakes. Faye uses em-http-request and faye-websocket in the Ruby
 version of its client. Those libraries both use the
 `EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLS
 handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This method
 does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that it
 does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificate
 for the expected hostname. That means that any `https:` or `wss:`
 connection made using these libraries is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle
 attack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server it is
 connected to. The first request a Faye client makes is always sent via
 normal HTTP, but later messages may be sent via WebSocket. Therefore it is
 vulnerable to the same problem that these underlying libraries are, and we
 needed both libraries to support TLS verification before Faye could claim
 to do the same. Your client would still be insecure if its initial HTTPS
 request was verified, but later WebSocket connections were not. This is
 fixed in Faye v1.4.0, which enables verification by default. For further
 background information on this issue, please see the referenced GitHub
 Advisory.
