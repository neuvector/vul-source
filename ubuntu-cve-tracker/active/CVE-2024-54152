Description:
 Angular Expressions provides expressions for the Angular.JS web framework
 as a standalone module. Prior to version 1.4.3, an attacker can write a
 malicious expression that escapes the sandbox to execute arbitrary code on
 the system. With a more complex (undisclosed) payload, one can get full
 access to Arbitrary code execution on the system. The problem has been
 patched in version 1.4.3 of Angular Expressions. Two possible workarounds
 are available. One may either disable access to `__proto__` globally or
 make sure that one uses the function with just one argument.
