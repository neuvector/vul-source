Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are missing memory
 barriers when accessing/allocating an event channel. Event channels control
 structures can be accessed lockless as long as the port is considered to be
 valid. Such a sequence is missing an appropriate memory barrier (e.g.,
 smp_*mb()) to prevent both the compiler and CPU from re-ordering access. A
 malicious guest may be able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a
 Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot
 be excluded. Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. Whether a
 system is vulnerable will depend on the CPU and compiler used to build Xen.
 For all systems, the presence and the scope of the vulnerability depend on
 the precise re-ordering performed by the compiler used to build Xen. We
 have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which
 compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code generation
 options). GCC documentation clearly suggests that re-ordering is possible.
 Arm systems will also be vulnerable if the CPU is able to re-order memory
 access. Please consult your CPU vendor. x86 systems are only vulnerable if
 a compiler performs re-ordering.
