Description:
 Mishandling of guest SSBD selection on AMD hardware The current logic to
 set SSBD on AMD Family 17h and Hygon Family 18h processors requires that
 the setting of SSBD is coordinated at a core level, as the setting is
 shared between threads. Logic was introduced to keep track of how many
 threads require SSBD active in order to coordinate it, such logic relies on
 using a per-core counter of threads that have SSBD active. When running on
 the mentioned hardware, it's possible for a guest to under or overflow the
 thread counter, because each write to VIRT_SPEC_CTRL.SSBD by the guest gets
 propagated to the helper that does the per-core active accounting.
 Underflowing the counter causes the value to get saturated, and thus
 attempts for guests running on the same core to set SSBD won't have effect
 because the hypervisor assumes it's already active.
