Description:
 Git LFS is a Git extension for versioning large files. When Git LFS
 requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the
 host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded
 line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives
 back from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By inserting
 URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return
 (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's
 Git credentials. This problem exists in all previous versions and is
 patched in v3.6.1. All users should upgrade to v3.6.1. There are no
 workarounds known at this time.
