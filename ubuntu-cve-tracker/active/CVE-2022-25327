Description:
 The PAM module for fscrypt doesn't adequately validate fscrypt metadata
 files, allowing users to create malicious metadata files that prevent other
 users from logging in. A local user can cause a denial of service by
 creating a fscrypt metadata file that prevents other users from logging
 into the system. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above
