Description:
 A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl.
 
 Release branches 5.34, 5.36, 5.38 and 5.40 are affected, including
 development versions from 5.33.1 through 5.41.10.
 
 When there are non-ASCII bytes in the left-hand-side of the `tr` operator,
 `S_do_trans_invmap` can overflow the destination pointer `d`.
 
    $ perl -e '$_ = "\x{FF}" x 1000000; tr/\xFF/\x{100}/;'
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)
 
 It is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial of Service and
 possibly Code Execution attacks on platforms that lack sufficient defenses.
