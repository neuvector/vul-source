Description:
 Shaarli is a minimalist bookmark manager and link sharing service. Prior to
 0.15.0, the input string in the cloud tag page is not properly sanitized.
 This allows the </title> tag to be prematurely closed, leading to a
 reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is
 fixed in 0.15.0.
