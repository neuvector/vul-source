Description:
 Twig is an open source template language for PHP. When in a sandbox mode,
 the `arrow` parameter of the `sort` filter must be a closure to avoid
 attackers being able to run arbitrary PHP functions. In affected versions
 this constraint was not properly enforced and could lead to code injection
 of arbitrary PHP code. Patched versions now disallow calling non Closure in
 the `sort` filter as is the case for some other filters. Users are advised
 to upgrade.
