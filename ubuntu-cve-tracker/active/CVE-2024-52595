Description:
 lxml_html_clean is a project for HTML cleaning functionalities copied from
 `lxml.html.clean`. Prior to version 0.4.0, the HTML Parser in lxml does not
 properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `<svg>`,
 `<math>` and `<noscript>`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers
 parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is
 ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web
 browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This
 vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks,
 compromising the security of users relying on lxml_html_clean in default
 configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content. Users employing the
 HTML cleaner in a security-sensitive context should upgrade to lxml 0.4.0,
 which addresses this issue. As a temporary mitigation, users can configure
 lxml_html_clean with the following settings to prevent the exploitation of
 this vulnerability. Via `remove_tags`, one may specify tags to remove -
 their content is moved to their parents' tags. Via `kill_tags`, one may
 specify tags to be removed completely. Via `allow_tags`, one may restrict
 the set of permissible tags, excluding context-switching tags like `<svg>`,
 `<math>` and `<noscript>`.
