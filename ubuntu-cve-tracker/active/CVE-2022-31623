Description:
 MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In
 extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the
 err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock
 thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to
 trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.
