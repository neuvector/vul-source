Description:
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
 detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
 bypass a configured File Policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to
 incorrect detection of modified HTTP packets used in chunked responses. An
 attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets
 through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
 to bypass a configured File Policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious
 payload.
