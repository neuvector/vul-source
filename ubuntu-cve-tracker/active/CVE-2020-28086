Description:
 pass through 1.7.3 has a possibility of using a password for an unintended
 resource. For exploitation to occur, the user must do a git pull, decrypt a
 password, and log into a remote service with the password. If an attacker
 controls the central Git server or one of the other members' machines, and
 also controls one of the services already in the password store, they can
 rename one of the password files in the Git repository to something else:
 pass doesn't correctly verify that the content of a file matches the
 filename, so a user might be tricked into decrypting the wrong password and
 sending that to a service that the attacker controls. NOTE: for
 environments in which this threat model is of concern, signing commits can
 be a solution.
