Description:
 Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows
 code injection if the first argument (aka the "command" argument) to
 Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb is untrusted data. An attacker can
 exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that JRuby did not properly sanitize input to Shell#[] and
 its alias Shell#test. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute
 arbitrary commands.
