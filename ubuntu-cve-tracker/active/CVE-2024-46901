Description:
 Insufficient validation of filenames against control characters in Apache
 Subversion repositories served via mod_dav_svn allows authenticated users
 with commit access to commit a corrupted revision, leading to disruption
 for users of the repository.
 
 All versions of Subversion up to and including Subversion 1.14.4 are
 affected if serving repositories via mod_dav_svn. Users are recommended to
 upgrade to version 1.14.5, which fixes this issue.
 
 Repositories served via other access methods are not affected.
