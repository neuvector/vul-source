Description:
 Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security.
 Prior to version 2.1.5, a DTLS Client could provide a Certificate that it
 doesn't posses the private key for and Pion DTLS wouldn't reject it. This
 issue affects users that are using Client certificates only. The connection
 itself is still secure. The Certificate provided by clients can't be
 trusted when using a Pion DTLS server prior to version 2.1.5. Users should
 upgrade to version 2.1.5 to receive a patch. There are currently no known
 workarounds.
