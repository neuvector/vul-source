Description:
 The current setup of the quarantine page tables assumes that the quarantine
 domain (dom_io) has been initialized with an address width of
 DEFAULT_DOMAIN_ADDRESS_WIDTH (48) and hence 4 page table levels. However
 dom_io being a PV domain gets the AMD-Vi IOMMU page tables levels based on
 the maximum (hot pluggable) RAM address, and hence on systems with no RAM
 above the 512GB mark only 3 page-table levels are configured in the IOMMU.
 On systems without RAM above the 512GB boundary amd_iommu_quarantine_init()
 will setup page tables for the scratch page with 4 levels, while the IOMMU
 will be configured to use 3 levels only, resulting in the last page table
 directory (PDE) effectively becoming a page table entry (PTE), and hence a
 device in quarantine mode gaining write access to the page destined to be a
 PDE. Due to this page table level mismatch, the sink page the device gets
 read/write access to is no longer cleared between device assignment,
 possibly leading to data leaks.
