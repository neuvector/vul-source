Description:
 FontForge SFD File Parsing Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of FontForge. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SFD files. The issue results
 from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing
 operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
 execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-28564.
