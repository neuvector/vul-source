Description:
 In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll()
 was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable
 values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to
 weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both
 using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects
 applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not
 affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in
 OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling
 RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make
 RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling
 RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running
 in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we
 recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per
 Allansson from Appgate for the report.
