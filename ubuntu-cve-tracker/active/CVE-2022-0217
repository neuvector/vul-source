Description:
 It was discovered that an internal Prosody library to load XML based on
 libexpat does not properly restrict the XML features allowed in parsed XML
 data. Given suitable attacker input, this results in expansion of recursive
 entity references from DTDs (CWE-776). In addition, depending on the
 libexpat version used, it may also allow injections using XML External
 Entity References (CWE-611).
