Description:
 A flaw was found in the HFS filesystem. When reading an HFS volume's name
 at grub_fs_mount(), the HFS filesystem driver performs a strcpy() using the
 user-provided volume name as input without properly validating the volume
 name's length. This issue may read to a heap-based out-of-bounds writer,
 impacting grub's sensitive data integrity and eventually leading to a
 secure boot protection bypass.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
