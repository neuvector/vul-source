Description:
 An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 up to and including
 4.3.0. It allows an attacker (with enough privileges to change the system's
 hostname) to cause disclosure of uninitialized memory content via a
 stack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems where
 gethostname() does not have '\0' termination of the returned string if the
 hostname is larger than the supplied buffer. (Linux systems are not
 affected because the buffer is always large enough. OpenBSD systems are not
 affected because the returned hostname always has '\0' termination.) Under
 some conditions, this issue can lead to the writing of one '\0' byte
 out-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial of service or possibly
 arbitrary code execution.
