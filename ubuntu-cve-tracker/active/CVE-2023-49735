Description:
 ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The value set as the
 DefaultLocaleResolver.LOCALE_KEY attribute on the session was not validated
 while resolving XML definition files, leading to possible path traversal
 and eventually SSRF/XXE when passing user-controlled data to this key.
 Passing user-controlled data to this key may be relatively common, as it
 was also used like that to set the language in the 'tiles-test' application
 shipped with Tiles. This issue affects Apache Tiles from version 2 onwards.
 NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported
 by the maintainer.
