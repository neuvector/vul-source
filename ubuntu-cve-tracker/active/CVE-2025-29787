Description:
 `zip` is a zip library for rust which supports reading and writing of
 simple ZIP files. In the archive extraction routine of affected versions of
 the `zip` crate starting with version 1.3.0 and prior to version 2.3.0,
 symbolic links earlier in the archive are allowed to be used for later
 files in the archive without validation of the final canonicalized path,
 allowing maliciously crafted archives to overwrite arbitrary files in the
 file system when extracted. Users who extract untrusted archive files using
 the following high-level API method may be affected and critical files on
 the system may be overwritten with arbitrary file permissions, which can
 potentially lead to code execution. Version 2.3.0 fixes the issue.
