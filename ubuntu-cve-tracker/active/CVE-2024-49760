Description:
 OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. The
 load-language command expects a `lang` parameter from which it constructs
 the path of the localization file to load, of the form
 `translations-$LANG.json`. But when doing so in versions prior to 3.8.3, it
 does not check that the resulting path is in the expected directory, which
 means that this command could be exploited to read other JSON files on the
 file system. Version 3.8.3 addresses this issue.
