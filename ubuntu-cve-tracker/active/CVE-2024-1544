Description:
 Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then
 truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the
 order of the elliptic curve. Meaning k = r mod n. The division used
 during the reduction estimates a factor q_e by dividing the upper two
 digits (a digit having e.g. a size of 8 byte) of r by the upper digit of
 n and then decrements q_e in a loop until it has the correct size.
 Observing the number of times q_e is decremented through a control-flow
 revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of
 k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a
 significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction
 methods. For SECP160R1, e.g., we find a bias of 15 bits.
