Description:
 filelock is a platform-independent file lock for Python. Prior to version
 3.20.3, a TOCTOU race condition vulnerability exists in the SoftFileLock
 implementation of the filelock package. An attacker with local filesystem
 access and permission to create symlinks can exploit a race condition
 between the permission validation and file creation to cause lock
 operations to fail or behave unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs in the
 _acquire() method between raise_on_not_writable_file() (permission check)
 and os.open() (file creation). During this race window, an attacker can
 create a symlink at the lock file path, potentially causing the lock to
 operate on an unintended target file or leading to denial of service. This
 issue has been patched in version 3.20.3.
