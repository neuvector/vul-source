Description:
 An issue was discovered in Znuny through 6.5.14 and 7.x through 7.1.6.
 Custom AJAX calls to the AgentPreferences UpdateAJAX subaction can be used
 to set user preferences with arbitrary keys. When fetching user data via
 GetUserData, these keys and values are retrieved and given as a whole to
 other function calls, which then might use these keys/values to affect
 permissions or other settings.
