Description:
 In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to use the nghttp2
 library to process incoming DNS over HTTPS queries, an attacker might be
 able to cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers
 an unbounded I/O read loop, causing an unexpected consumption of CPU
 resources.
