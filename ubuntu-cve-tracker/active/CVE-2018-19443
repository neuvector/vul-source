Description:
 The client in Tryton 5.x before 5.0.1 tries to make a connection to the bus
 in cleartext instead of encrypted under certain circumstances in bus.py and
 jsonrpc.py. This connection attempt fails, but it contains in the header
 the current session of the user. This session could then be stolen by a
 man-in-the-middle.
