Description:
 Integer overflows were discovered in the functions grub_cmd_initrd and
 grub_initrd_init in the efilinux component of GRUB2, as shipped in Debian,
 Red Hat, and Ubuntu (the functionality is not included in GRUB2 upstream),
 leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. These could be triggered by an
 extremely large number of arguments to the initrd command on 32-bit
 architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large files on any
 architecture. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and
 bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04
 and prior versions.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Colin Watson and Chris Coulson discovered that an integer overflow
 existed in GRUB2 when handling the initrd command, leading to a heap-based
 buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code
 and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.

 sbeattie| Title: grub2: integer overflows in efilinux grub_cmd_initrd
   and grub_initrd_init leads to heap based buffer overflow
 sbeattie| code is not upstream in grub2 but carried as part of patches
   by Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat and possibly others.
