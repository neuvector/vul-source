Description:
 Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in PointCloudLibrary pcl allows Overflow
 Buffers. Since version 1.14.0, PCL by default uses a zlib installation from
 the system, unless the user sets WITH_SYSTEM_ZLIB=FALSE. So this potential
 vulnerability is only relevant if the PCL version is older than 1.14.0 or
 the user specifically requests to not use the system zlib.
