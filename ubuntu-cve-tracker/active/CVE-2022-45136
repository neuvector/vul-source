Description:
 ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Apache Jena SDB 3.17.0 and earlier is
 vulnerable to a JDBC Deserialisation attack if the attacker is able to
 control the JDBC URL used or cause the underlying database server to return
 malicious data. The mySQL JDBC driver in particular is known to be
 vulnerable to this class of attack. As a result an application using Apache
 Jena SDB can be subject to RCE when connected to a malicious database
 server. Apache Jena SDB has been EOL since December 2020 and users should
 migrate to alternative options e.g. Apache Jena TDB 2.
