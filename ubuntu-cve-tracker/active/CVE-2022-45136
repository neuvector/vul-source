Description:
 Apache Jena SDB 3.17.0 and earlier is vulnerable to a JDBC Deserialisation
 attack if the attacker is able to control the JDBC URL used or cause the
 underlying database server to return malicious data. The mySQL JDBC driver
 in particular is known to be vulnerable to this class of attack. As a
 result an application using Apache Jena SDB can be subject to RCE when
 connected to a malicious database server. Apache Jena SDB has been EOL
 since December 2020 and users should migrate to alternative options e.g.
 Apache Jena TDB 2.
