Description:
 A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the safe_asterisk
 script included with the Asterisk toolkit package. When Asterisk is started
 via this script (common in SysV init or FreePBX environments), it sources
 all .sh files located in /etc/asterisk/startup.d/ as root, without
 validating ownership or permissions.
 
 
 Non-root users with legitimate write access to /etc/asterisk can exploit
 this behaviour by placing malicious scripts in the startup.d directory,
 which will then execute with root privileges upon service restart.
