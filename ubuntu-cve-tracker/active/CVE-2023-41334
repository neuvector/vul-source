 https://github.com/astropy/astropy/commit/22057d37b1313f5f5a9b5783df0a091d978dccb5 (v5.3.3)
Description:
 Astropy is a project for astronomy in Python that fosters interoperability
 between Python astronomy packages. Version 5.3.2 of the Astropy core
 package is vulnerable to remote code execution due to improper input
 validation in the `TranformGraph().to_dot_graph` function. A malicious user
 can provide a command or a script file as a value to the `savelayout`
 argument, which will be placed as the first value in a list of arguments
 passed to `subprocess.Popen`. Although an error will be raised, the command
 or script will be executed successfully. Version 5.3.3 fixes this issue.
