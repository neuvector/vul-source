Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4
 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library
 v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input using the “ctts” FOURCC code can
 cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a
 heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can
 convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.
