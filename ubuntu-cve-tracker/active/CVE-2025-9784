Description:
 A flaw was found in Undertow where malformed client requests can trigger
 server-side stream resets without triggering abuse counters. This issue,
 referred to as the "MadeYouReset" attack, allows malicious clients to
 induce excessive server workload by repeatedly causing server-side stream
 aborts. While not a protocol bug, this highlights a common implementation
 weakness that can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS).
