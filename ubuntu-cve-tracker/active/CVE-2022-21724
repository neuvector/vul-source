Description:
 pgjdbc is the offical PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. A security hole was found in
 the jdbc driver for postgresql database while doing security research. The
 system using the postgresql library will be attacked when attacker control
 the jdbc url or properties. pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on
 class names provided via `authenticationPluginClassName`,
 `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback`
 connection properties. However, the driver did not verify if the class
 implements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This can
 lead to code execution loaded via arbitrary classes. Users using plugins
 are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
