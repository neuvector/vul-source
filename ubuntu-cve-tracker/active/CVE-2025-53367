Description:
 DjVuLibre is a GPL implementation of DjVu, a web-centric format for
 distributing documents and images. Prior to version 3.5.29, the
 MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability,
 because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of
 the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory,
 resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is
 also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version
 3.5.29.
