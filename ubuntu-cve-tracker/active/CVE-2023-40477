Description:
 RARLAB WinRAR Recovery Volume Improper Validation of Array Index Remote
 Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code on affected installations of RARLAB WinRAR. User
 interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
 must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw
 exists within the processing of recovery volumes. The issue results from
 the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a
 memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage
 this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
 Was ZDI-CAN-21233.
