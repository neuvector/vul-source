Description:
 systemd before 247 does not adequately block local privilege escalation for
 some Sudo configurations, e.g., plausible sudoers files in which the
 "systemctl status" command may be executed. Specifically, systemd does not
 set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less
 program. This presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl
 from Sudo, because less executes as root when the terminal size is too
 small to show the complete systemctl output.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> on https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5666
  upstream claims this is not a vulnerability.
 rodrigo-zaiden> upstream feature SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE implemented
  in systemd version 247.
 mdeslaur> This is only an issue if an administrator configured systemctl
 mdeslaur> access using sudo instead of using policykit, which is an
 mdeslaur> unlikely scenario. Per Red Hat bug, systemctl commands that use
 mdeslaur> the pager can run unprivileged. Setting priority to "low".
