Description:
 A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a query,
 dnsmasq does not check for an existing pending request for the same name
 and forwards a new request. By default, a maximum of 150 pending queries
 can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at most 150 queries for
 the same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the network to
 substantially reduce the number of attempts that it would have to perform
 to forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned
 in the "Birthday Attacks" section of RFC5452. If chained with
 CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced.
 The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
