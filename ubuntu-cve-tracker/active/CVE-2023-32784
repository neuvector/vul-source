Description:
 In KeePass 2.x before 2.54, it is possible to recover the cleartext master
 password from a memory dump, even when a workspace is locked or no longer
 running. The memory dump can be a KeePass process dump, swap file
 (pagefile.sys), hibernation file (hiberfil.sys), or RAM dump of the entire
 system. The first character cannot be recovered. In 2.54, there is
 different API usage and/or random string insertion for mitigation.
