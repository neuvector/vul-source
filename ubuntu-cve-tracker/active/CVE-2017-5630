Description:
 PECL in the download utility class in the Installer in PEAR Base System
 v1.10.1 does not validate file types and filenames after a redirect, which
 allows remote HTTP servers to overwrite files via crafted responses, as
 demonstrated by a .htaccess overwrite.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> PEAR issues should go against php-pear as of xenial
 seth-arnold> PEAR/PECL appears to have no authenticity checks of any sort. As
  far as I can tell any malicious MITM can install whatever they want anyway.
