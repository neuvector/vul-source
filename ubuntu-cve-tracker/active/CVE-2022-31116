Description:
 UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with
 bindings for Python 3.7+. Affected versions were found to improperly decode
 certain characters. JSON strings that contain escaped surrogate characters
 not part of a proper surrogate pair were decoded incorrectly. Besides
 corrupting strings, this allowed for potential key confusion and value
 overwriting in dictionaries. All users parsing JSON from untrusted sources
 are vulnerable. From version 5.4.0, UltraJSON decodes lone surrogates in
 the same way as the standard library's `json` module does, preserving them
 in the parsed output. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> the embedded ujson code in pandas, eventhough containing similar
 ccdm94> content as the upstream ujson code, seems to have diverged from the
 ccdm94> ujson upstream project (they have fully forked ujson), since pandas
 ccdm94> upstream is maintaining their own ujson bug fixes and changes without
 ccdm94> re-syncing with the ujson upstream project. There is no indication
 ccdm94> the ujson fork, as used in pandas, is vulnerable to the same issues
 ccdm94> as the upstream ujson code.
 ccdm94> 
 ccdm94> according to https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/releases/tag/5.4.0,
 ccdm94> the commits that fix this issue are e0e5db9a46 and bc7bdff051. However,
 ccdm94> release 5.4.0 does include a few other commits which seem to be related
 ccdm94> to the above.
