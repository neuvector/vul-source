Description:
 An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. In ruby-mode.el, the
 ruby-find-library-file function has a local command injection
 vulnerability. The ruby-find-library-file function is an interactive
 function, and bound to C-c C-f. Inside the function, the external command
 gem is called through shell-command-to-string, but the feature-name
 parameters are not escaped. Thus, malicious Ruby source files may cause
 commands to be executed.
