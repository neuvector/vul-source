Description:
 Miniflux is a feed reader. Due to a weak Content Security Policy on the
 /proxy/* route, an attacker can bypass the CSP of the media proxy and
 execute cross-site scripting when opening external images in a new
 tab/window. To mitigate the vulnerability, the CSP for the media proxy has
 been changed from default-src 'self' to default-src 'none'; form-action
 'none'; sandbox;. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.7.
