Description:
 node-fetch before versions 2.6.1 and 3.0.0-beta.9 did not honor the size
 option after following a redirect, which means that when a content size was
 over the limit, a FetchError would never get thrown and the process would
 end without failure. For most people, this fix will have a little or no
 impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a
 size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't
 double-check the size of the data after fetch() has completed, your JS
 thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you
 money in computing.
