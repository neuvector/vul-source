Description:
 An issue was discovered in Symfony before 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13,
 3.4-BETA5, and 4.0-BETA5. When a form is submitted by the user, the request
 handler classes of the Form component merge POST data and uploaded files
 data into one array. This big array forms the data that are then bound to
 the form. At this stage there is no difference anymore between submitted
 POST data and uploaded files. A user can send a crafted HTTP request where
 the value of a "FileType" is sent as normal POST data that could be
 interpreted as a local file path on the server-side (for example,
 "file:///etc/passwd"). If the application did not perform any additional
 checks about the value submitted to the "FileType", the contents of the
 given file on the server could have been exposed to the attacker.
