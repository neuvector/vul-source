Description:
 An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource
 record-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing
 compressed labels in mDNS messages, the compression pointer is followed
 without checking for recursion, leading to a denial of service. An attacker
 can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.
