Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. x86 PV guest kernels can
 experience denial of service via SYSENTER. The SYSENTER instruction leaves
 various state sanitization activities to software. One of Xen's
 sanitization paths injects a #GP fault, and incorrectly delivers it twice
 to the guest. This causes the guest kernel to observe a kernel-privilege
 #GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a user-privilege #GP fault (usually
 converted into SIGSEGV/etc.). Malicious or buggy userspace can crash the
 guest kernel, resulting in a VM Denial of Service. All versions of Xen from
 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM platforms
 are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that support the SYSENTER instruction
 in 64bit mode are vulnerable. This is believed to be Intel, Centaur, and
 Shanghai CPUs. AMD and Hygon CPUs are not believed to be vulnerable. Only
 x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 PVH / HVM guests cannot
 exploit the vulnerability.
