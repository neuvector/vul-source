Description:
 An issue was discovered in LinuxTV xawtv before 3.107. The function
 dev_open() in v4l-conf.c does not perform sufficient checks to prevent an
 unprivileged caller of the program from opening unintended filesystem
 paths. This allows a local attacker with access to the v4l-conf setuid-root
 program to test for the existence of arbitrary files and to trigger an open
 on arbitrary files with mode O_RDWR. To achieve this, relative path
 components need to be added to the device path, as demonstrated by a
 v4l-conf -c /dev/../root/.bash_history command.
