Description:
 An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was discovered in the PCRE2 library in
 the compile_xclass_matchingpath() function of the pcre2_jit_compile.c file.
 This involves a unicode property matching issue in JIT-compiled regular
 expressions. The issue occurs because the character was not fully read in
 case-less matching within JIT.
