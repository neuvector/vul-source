Description:
 A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server. When a client connects to
 the VNC server, QEMU checks whether the current number of connections
 crosses a certain threshold and if so, cleans up the previous connection.
 If the previous connection happens to be in the handshake phase and fails,
 QEMU cleans up the connection again, resulting in a NULL pointer
 dereference issue. This could allow a remote unauthenticated client to
 cause a denial of service.
