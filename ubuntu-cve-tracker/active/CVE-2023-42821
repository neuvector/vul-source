Description:
 The package `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown` is a Go library for parsing
 Markdown text and rendering as HTML. Prior to pseudoversion
 `0.0.0-20230922105210-14b16010c2ee`, which corresponds with commit
 `14b16010c2ee7ff33a940a541d993bd043a88940`, parsing malformed markdown
 input with parser that uses parser.Mmark extension could result in
 out-of-bounds read vulnerability. To exploit the vulnerability, parser
 needs to have `parser.Mmark` extension set. The panic occurs inside the
 `citation.go` file on the line 69 when the parser tries to access the
 element past its length. This can result in a denial of service. Commit
 `14b16010c2ee7ff33a940a541d993bd043a88940`/pseudoversion
 `0.0.0-20230922105210-14b16010c2ee` contains a patch for this issue.
