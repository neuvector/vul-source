Description:
 A flaw was found in the asynchronous message queue handling of the libsoup
 library, widely used by GNOME and WebKit-based applications to manage
 HTTP/2 communications. When network operations are aborted at specific
 timing intervals, an internal message queue item may be freed twice due to
 missing state synchronization. This leads to a use-after-free memory
 access, potentially crashing the affected application. Attackers could
 exploit this behavior remotely by triggering specific HTTP/2 read and
 cancel sequences, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
