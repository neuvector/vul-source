Description:
 A vulnerability in the PDF scanning processes of ClamAV could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition,
 cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, or execute arbitrary code on an
 affected device.
 
 This vulnerability exists because memory buffers are allocated incorrectly
 when PDF files are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
 by submitting a crafted PDF file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected
 device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a buffer
 overflow, likely resulting in the termination of the ClamAV scanning
 process and a DoS condition on the affected software. Although unproven,
 there is also a possibility that an attacker could leverage the buffer
 overflow to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV
 process.
