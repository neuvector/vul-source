Description:
 ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control
 repositories. Versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.1.30 are vulnerable to
 cross-site scripting. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the
 need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository
 exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves
 files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream,
 would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be
 challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.3 (if
 they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.30 (if they are using a
 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that
 release lineage should implement one of the following workarounds. Users
 can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed
 path "copyfrom paths" during rendering. Locate in your template set's
 `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths, and wrap them with
 `[format "html"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references
 to `[changes.copy_path]` will become `[format
 "html"][changes.copy_path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after
 upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else "copyfrom path" names will
 be doubly escaped.)
