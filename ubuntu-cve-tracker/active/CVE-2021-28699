Description:
 inadequate grant-v2 status frames array bounds check The v2 grant table
 interface separates grant attributes from grant status. That is, when
 operating in this mode, a guest has two tables. As a result, guests also
 need to be able to retrieve the addresses that the new status tracking
 table can be accessed through. For 32-bit guests on x86, translation of
 requests has to occur because the interface structure layouts commonly
 differ between 32- and 64-bit. The translation of the request to obtain the
 frame numbers of the grant status table involves translating the resulting
 array of frame numbers. Since the space used to carry out the translation
 is limited, the translation layer tells the core function the capacity of
 the array within translation space. Unfortunately the core function then
 only enforces array bounds to be below 8 times the specified value, and
 would write past the available space if enough frame numbers needed
 storing.
