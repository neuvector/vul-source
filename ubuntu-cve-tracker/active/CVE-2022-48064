Description:
 GNU Binutils before 2.40 was discovered to contain an excessive memory
 consumption vulnerability via the function
 bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line_with_alt at dwarf2.c. The attacker could
 supply a crafted ELF file and cause a DNS attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> binutils isn't safe for untrusted inputs.
 ccdm94> upstream does not consider this a security issue, as per
 ccdm94> their binutils/SECURITY.txt security file. That is because
 ccdm94> this issue affects nm, an inspection tool. For bionic and
 ccdm94> earlier, the patch seems to introduce a memory leak, so
 ccdm94> these releases will be marked as ignored.
