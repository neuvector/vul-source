Description:
 A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Radare2 5.9.9.
 Affected by this vulnerability is the function cons_stack_load in the
 library /libr/cons/cons.c of the component radiff2. The manipulation of the
 argument -T leads to memory corruption. An attack has to be approached
 locally. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation
 appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and
 may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at
 the moment. The patch is named 5705d99cc1f23f36f9a84aab26d1724010b97798. It
 is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The documentation
 explains that the parameter -T is experimental and "crashy". Further
 analysis has shown "the race is not a real problem unless you use asan". A
 new warning has been added.
