Description:
 stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. It
 may look like `stbi__load_gif_main` doesn’t give guarantees about the
 content of output value `*delays` upon failure. Although it sets `*delays`
 to zero at the beginning, it doesn’t do it in case the image is not
 recognized as GIF and a call to `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` only frees
 possibly allocated memory in `*delays` without resetting it to zero. Thus
 it would be fair to say the caller of `stbi__load_gif_main` is responsible
 to free the allocated memory in `*delays` only if `stbi__load_gif_main`
 returns a non null value. However at the same time the function may return
 null value, but fail to free the memory in `*delays` if internally
 `stbi__convert_format` is called and fails. Thus the issue may lead to a
 memory leak if the caller chooses to free `delays` only when
 `stbi__load_gif_main` didn’t fail or to a double-free if the `delays` is
 always freed
