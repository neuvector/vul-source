Description:
 The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete for Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 to
 11.0.0-M4, 10.1.5 to 10.1.7, 9.0.71 to 9.0.73 and 8.5.85 to 8.5.87. If
 non-default HTTP connector settings were used such that the
 maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters and a
 request was submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters in
 the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be bypassed
 with the potential for a denial of service to occur.
