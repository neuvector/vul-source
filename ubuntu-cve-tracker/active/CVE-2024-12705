Description:
 Clients using DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) can exhaust a DNS resolver's CPU and/or
 memory by flooding it with crafted valid or invalid HTTP/2 traffic.
 This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.18.0 through 9.18.32, 9.20.0 through
 9.20.4, 9.21.0 through 9.21.3, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.32-S1.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As of isc-dhcp-4.4.3-1, isc-dhcp vendors bind9 libs
 mdeslaur> in focal and jammy, isc-dhcp uses the bind9-libs package
 mdeslaur> This is unlikely to affect isc-dhcp's use of bind9-libs and the
 mdeslaur> vendored bind9 libs, marking as negligible
