Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In
 affected versions when the fine-grained access control beta feature is
 enabled and there is more than one organization in the Grafana instance
 admins are able to access users from other organizations. Grafana 8.0
 introduced a mechanism which allowed users with the Organization Admin role
 to list, add, remove, and update usersâ€™ roles in other organizations in
 which they are not an admin. With fine-grained access control enabled,
 organization admins can list, add, remove and update users' roles in
 another organization, where they do not have organization admin role. All
 installations between v8.0 and v8.2.3 that have fine-grained access control
 beta enabled and more than one organization should be upgraded as soon as
 possible. If you cannot upgrade, you should turn off the fine-grained
 access control using a feature flag.
