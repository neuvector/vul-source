Description:
 A security issue was discovered in GNU Wget2 when handling Metalink
 documents. The application fails to properly validate file paths provided
 in Metalink <file name> elements. An attacker can abuse this behavior to
 write files to unintended locations on the system. This can lead to data
 loss or potentially allow further compromise of the user’s environment.
