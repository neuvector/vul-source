Description:
 Thunderbird processes the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header to
 handle attachments which can be hosted externally. When an email is opened,
 Thunderbird accesses the specified URL to  determine file size, and
 navigates to it when the user clicks the attachment. Because the URL is not
 validated or sanitized, it can reference internal resources like chrome://
 or SMB share file:// links, potentially leading to hashed Windows
 credential leakage and opening the door to more serious security issues.
 This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 137.0.2 and Thunderbird < 128.9.2.
