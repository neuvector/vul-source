Description:
 GIMP ILBM File Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of ILBM files. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
 data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage
 this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
 Was ZDI-CAN-27793.
