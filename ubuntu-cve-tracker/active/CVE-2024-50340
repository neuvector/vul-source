Description:
 symfony/runtime is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which enables
 decoupling PHP applications from global state. When the
 `register_argv_argc` php directive is set to `on` , and users call any URL
 with a special crafted query string, they are able to change the
 environment or debug mode used by the kernel when handling the request. As
 of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `SymfonyRuntime` now ignores the
 `argv` values for non-SAPI PHP runtimes. All users are advised to upgrade.
 There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
