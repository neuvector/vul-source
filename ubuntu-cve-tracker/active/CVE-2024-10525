Description:
 In Eclipse Mosquitto, from version 1.3.2 through 2.0.18, if a malicious
 broker sends a crafted SUBACK packet with no reason codes, a client using
 libmosquitto may make out of bounds memory access when acting in its
 on_subscribe callback. This affects the mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_rr
 clients.
