Description:
 Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. A fixed-output
 derivations on Linux can send file descriptors to files in the Nix store to
 another program running on the host (or another fixed-output derivation)
 via Unix domain sockets in the abstract namespace. This allows to modify
 the output of the derivation, after Nix has registered the path as "valid"
 and immutable in the Nix database. In particular, this allows the output of
 fixed-output derivations to be modified from their expected content. This
 issue has been addressed in versions 2.3.18 2.18.2 2.19.4 and 2.20.5. Users
 are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.
