Description:
 fastd is a VPN daemon which tunnels IP packets and Ethernet frames over
 UDP. When receiving a data packet from an unknown IP address/port
 combination, fastd will assume that one of its connected peers has moved to
 a new address and initiate a reconnect by sending a handshake packet. This
 "fast reconnect" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s)
 until a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet just
 containing the fastd packet type header can trigger a much larger handshake
 packet (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including IPv4 and UDP headers, the
 resulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13. By sending data packets
 with a spoofed source address to fastd instances reachable on the internet,
 this amplification of UDP traffic might be used to facilitate a Distributed
 Denial of Service attack. This vulnerability is fixed in v23.
