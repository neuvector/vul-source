Description:
 matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for
 JavaScript. In versions prior to 19.4.0 events sent with special strings in
 key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from
 functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to
 process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating
 normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the
 consumer. This issue has been fixed in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0 and users are
 advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by
 redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data,
 and restarting the client. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events
 and clearing all storage will often fix most perceived issues. In some
 cases, no workarounds are possible.
