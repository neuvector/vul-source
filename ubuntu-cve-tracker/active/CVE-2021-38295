Description:
 In Apache CouchDB, a malicious user with permission to create documents in
 a database is able to attach a HTML attachment to a document. If a CouchDB
 admin opens that attachment in a browser, e.g. via the CouchDB admin
 interface Fauxton, any JavaScript code embedded in that HTML attachment
 will be executed within the security context of that admin. A similar route
 is available with the already deprecated _show and _list functionality.
 This privilege escalation vulnerability allows an attacker to add or remove
 data in any database or make configuration changes. This issue affected
 Apache CouchDB prior to 3.1.2
