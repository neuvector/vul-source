Description:
 The ElGamal implementation in Crypto++ through 8.5 allows plaintext
 recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a
 certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver's public
 key, the generator defined by the receiver's public key, and the sender's
 ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against
 OpenPGP.
