Description:
 jackson-core contains core low-level incremental ("streaming") parser and
 generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. In versions prior to
 2.15.0, if a user parses an input file and it has deeply nested data,
 Jackson could end up throwing a StackoverflowError if the depth is
 particularly large. jackson-core 2.15.0 contains a configurable limit for
 how deep Jackson will traverse in an input document, defaulting to an
 allowable depth of 1000. jackson-core will throw a
 StreamConstraintsException if the limit is reached. jackson-databind also
 benefits from this change because it uses jackson-core to parse JSON
 inputs. As a workaround, users should avoid parsing input files from
 untrusted sources.
