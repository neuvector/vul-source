Description:
 Path Equivalence: 'file.Name' (Internal Dot) leading to Remote Code
 Execution and/or Information disclosure and/or malicious content added to
 uploaded files via write enabled Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat.
 
 This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2, from
 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98.
 
 If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view     
 security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:
 - writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
 - support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
 - a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of a
 target URL for public uploads
 - attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files
 being uploaded
 - the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT
 
 If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to     
 perform remote code execution:
 - writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
 - support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
 - application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with
 the default storage location
 - application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization
 attack
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.3, 10.1.35 or 9.0.99,
 which fixes the issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes: 
 vyomydv> Starting with 9.0.70-2 src:tomcat9 no longer ships the server stack,
 vyomydv> so those versions are only vulnerable if applications directly use 
 vyomydv> the affected Tomcat library.
Mitigation:
 Ubuntu Security team is working on the patch, till patched, do either of the following:

 - Disable write access for the servlet: update web.xml with readonly=true 
   for the default servlet
 - Disable support for partial PUT: update web.xml with allowPartialPut=false
   for the default servlet
