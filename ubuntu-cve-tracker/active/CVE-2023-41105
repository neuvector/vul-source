Description:
 An issue was discovered in Python 3.11 through 3.11.4. If a path containing
 '\0' bytes is passed to os.path.normpath(), the path will be truncated
 unexpectedly at the first '\0' byte. There are plausible cases in which an
 application would have rejected a filename for security reasons in Python
 3.10.x or earlier, but that filename is no longer rejected in Python
 3.11.x.
