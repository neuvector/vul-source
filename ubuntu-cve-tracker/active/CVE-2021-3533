Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible if an ansible user sets ANSIBLE_ASYNC_DIR to a
 subdirectory of a world writable directory. When this occurs, there is a
 race condition on the managed machine. A malicious, non-privileged account
 on the remote machine can exploit the race condition to access the async
 result data. This flaw affects Ansible Tower 3.7 and Ansible Automation
 Platform 1.2.
