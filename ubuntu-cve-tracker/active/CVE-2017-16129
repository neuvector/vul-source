Description:
 The HTTP client module superagent is vulnerable to ZIP bomb attacks. In a
 ZIP bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response that
 becomes several magnitudes larger once uncompressed. If a client does not
 take special care when processing such responses, it may result in
 excessive CPU and/or memory consumption. An attacker might exploit such a
 weakness for a DoS attack. To exploit this the attacker must control the
 location (URL) that superagent makes a request to.
