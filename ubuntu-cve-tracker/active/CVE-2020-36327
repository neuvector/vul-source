Description:
 Bundler 1.16.0 through 2.2.9 and 2.2.11 through 2.2.16 sometimes chooses a
 dependency source based on the highest gem version number, which means that
 a rogue gem found at a public source may be chosen, even if the intended
 choice was a private gem that is a dependency of another private gem that
 is explicitly depended on by the application. NOTE: it is not correct to
 use CVE-2021-24105 for every "Dependency Confusion" issue in every product.
