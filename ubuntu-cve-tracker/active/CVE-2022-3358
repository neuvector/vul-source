Description:
 OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy
 EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function
 was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead
 encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom
 ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom
 ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and
 EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption
 and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom
 cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the
 available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed
 to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID
 for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to
 incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to
 EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL
 encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as
 being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This
 will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party
 provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher
 means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are
 only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using
 NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption
 initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not
 impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.6 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.5).
