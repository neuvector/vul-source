Description:
 An issue was discovered in Yubico libykpiv before 2.1.0. lib/util.c in this
 library (which is included in yubico-piv-tool) does not properly check
 embedded length fields during device communication. A malicious PIV token
 can misreport the returned length fields during RSA key generation. This
 will cause stack memory to be copied into heap allocated memory that gets
 returned to the caller. The leaked memory could include PINs, passwords,
 key material, and other sensitive information depending on the integration.
 During further processing by the caller, this information could leak across
 trust boundaries. Note that RSA key generation is triggered by the host and
 cannot directly be triggered by the token.
