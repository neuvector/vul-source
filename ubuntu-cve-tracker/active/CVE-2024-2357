Description:
 The Libreswan Project was notified of an issue causing libreswan to restart
 under some IKEv2 retransmit scenarios when a connection is configured to
 use PreSharedKeys (authby=secret) and the connection cannot find a matching
 configured secret. When such a connection is automatically added on startup
 using the auto= keyword, it can cause repeated crashes leading to a Denial
 of Service.
