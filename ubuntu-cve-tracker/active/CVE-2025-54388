Description:
 Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is
 distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other
 downstream projects/products. In versions 28.2.0 through 28.3.2, when the
 firewalld service is reloaded it removes all iptables rules including those
 created by Docker. While Docker should automatically recreate these rules,
 versions before 28.3.3 fail to recreate the specific rules that block
 external access to containers. This means that after a firewalld reload,
 containers with ports published to localhost (like 127.0.0.1:8080) become
 accessible from remote machines that have network routing to the Docker
 bridge, even though they should only be accessible from the host itself.
 The vulnerability only affects explicitly published ports - unpublished
 ports remain protected. This issue is fixed in version 28.3.3.

Notes:
 alexmurray> Traditionally the docker.io source package contained both the
 alexmurray> library and docker application. However, in releases that
 alexmurray> contain the
 alexmurray> docker.io-app source package, the docker.io source package
 alexmurray> contains only
 alexmurray> the library whilst the docker application itself is contained
 alexmurray> in the
 alexmurray> docker.io-app package.
 sbeattie> docker packages contain an embedded copy of github:moby/buildkit
