Description:
 A flaw was found in Samba. Some SMB1 write requests were not correctly
 range-checked to ensure the client had sent enough data to fulfill the
 write, allowing server memory contents to be written into the file (or
 printer) instead of client-supplied data. The client cannot control the
 area of the server memory written to the file (or printer).
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> issue only exists in SMB1
 mdeslaur> Samba versions 4.11.0 and above disable SMB1 by default
Mitigation: 
 This issue can be mitigated by disabling SMB1, which is the default
 configuration in Samba 4.11 and above.
