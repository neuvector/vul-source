Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. From 2.8
 to before 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19, an authenticated user may use a
 specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out of bounds write on
 hyperloglog operations, potentially leading to remote code execution. The
 bug likely affects all Redis versions with hyperloglog operations
 implemented. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and
 6.2.19. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching
 the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing hyperloglog
 operations. This can be done using ACL to restrict HLL commands.
