Description:
 Multiple versions of OVN (Open Virtual Network) are vulnerable to
 allowing crafted UDP packets to bypass egress access control list (ACL)
 rules. This can result in unauthorized access to virtual machines and
 containers running on the OVN network.

 OVN provides rudimentary DNS caching as an optional feature to speed up
 lookups of frequently-used domains. When this feature is enabled, due to
 the OpenFlow rules that OVN installs in Open vSwitch, it is possible for
 an attacker to craft a UDP packet that can bypass egress ACL rules.
 Egress ACL rules are those that have the "direction" set to "to-lport".

 The OVN installation is vulnerable if a logical switch has DNS records
 set on it AND if the same switch has any egress ACLs configured on it.
 The switch is considered to have egress ACLs configured if the switch
 has an egress ACL configured directly on it using the "acls" column of
 the logical switch. A switch is also considered to have egress ACLs
 configured if any of its logical switch ports are part of a port group
 that has egress ACLs configured in its "acls" column.

 A python script (vuln_test.py) is attached to this advisory and can be
 used to determine if your installation is vulnerable. Run it in a
 location where "ovn-nbctl" is installed and can access the northbound
 database. The script will print to the console whether the installation
 is vulnerable.
