Description:
 jupyterlab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible
 computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook Architecture. Prior to version
 4.4.8, links generated with LaTeX typesetters in Markdown files and
 Markdown cells in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook did not include the
 noopener attribute. This is deemed to have no impact on the default
 installations. Theoretically users of third-party LaTeX-rendering
 extensions could find themselves vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing attacks
 if links generated by those extensions included target=_blank (no such
 extensions are known at time of writing) and they were to click on a link
 generated in LaTeX (typically visibly different from other links). This
 issue has been patched in version 4.4.8.
