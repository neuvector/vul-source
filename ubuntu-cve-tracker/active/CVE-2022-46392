Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.2 and 3.x before 3.3.0. An
 adversary with access to precise enough information about memory accesses
 (typically, an untrusted operating system attacking a secure enclave) can
 recover an RSA private key after observing the victim performing a single
 private-key operation, if the window size (MBEDTLS_MPI_WINDOW_SIZE) used
 for the exponentiation is 3 or smaller.
