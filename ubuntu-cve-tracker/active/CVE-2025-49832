Description:
 Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit.
 In versions up to and including 18.26.2, between 20.00.0 and 20.15.0,
 20.7-cert6, 21.00.0, 22.00.0 through 22.5.0, there is a remote DoS and
 possible RCE condition in `asterisk/res/res_stir_shaken /verification.c`
 that can be exploited when an attacker can set an arbitrary Identity
 header, or STIR/SHAKEN is enabled, with verification set in the SIP profile
 associated with the endpoint to be attacked. This is fixed in versions
 18.26.3, 20.7-cert6, 20.15.1, 21.10.1 and 22.5.1.
