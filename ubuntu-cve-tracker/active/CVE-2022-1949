Description:
 An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base. That
 mishandling of the filter that would yield incorrect results, but as that
 has progressed, can be determined that it actually is an access control
 bypass. This may allow any remote unauthenticated user to issue a filter
 that allows searching for database items they do not have access to,
 including but not limited to potentially userPassword hashes and other
 sensitive data.
