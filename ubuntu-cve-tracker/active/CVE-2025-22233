Description:
 CVE-2024-38820 ensured Locale-independent, lowercase conversion for both
 the configured disallowedFields patterns and for request parameter names.
 However, there are still cases where it is possible to bypass the
 disallowedFields checks.

 Generally, we recommend using a dedicated model object with properties only
 for data binding, or using constructor binding since constructor arguments
 explicitly declare what to bind together with turning off setter binding
 through the declarativeBinding flag. See the Model Design section in the
 reference documentation.
 
 For setting binding, prefer the use of allowedFields (an explicit list)
 over disallowedFields.
