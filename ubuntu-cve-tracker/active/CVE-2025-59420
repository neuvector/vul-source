Description:
 Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers.
 Prior to version 1.6.4, Authlib’s JWS verification accepts tokens that
 declare unknown critical header parameters (crit), violating RFC 7515
 “must‑understand” semantics. An attacker can craft a signed token with a
 critical header (for example, bork or cnf) that strict verifiers reject but
 Authlib accepts. In mixed‑language fleets, this enables split‑brain
 verification and can lead to policy bypass, replay, or privilege
 escalation. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.4.
