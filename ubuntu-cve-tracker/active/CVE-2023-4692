Description:
 An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in grub2's NTFS filesystem driver.
 This issue may allow an attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS
 filesystem image, leading to grub's heap metadata corruption. In some
 circumstances, the attack may also corrupt the UEFI firmware heap metadata.
 As a result, arbitrary code execution and secure boot protection bypass may
 be achieved.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that a specially crafted file system image could cause a
 heap-based out-of-bounds write. An attacker could potentially use this to
 perform arbitrary code execution bypass and bypass secure boot protections.
Notes:
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes
 eslerm> the grub2 package unlikely affects Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2 and grub2-unsigned should have same major version
 eslerm| Ubuntu Secure Boot and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel
  cannot handle new versions of grub
 eslerm| Note that key revocation is required to protect against evil
  housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
 eslerm> CWE-122
