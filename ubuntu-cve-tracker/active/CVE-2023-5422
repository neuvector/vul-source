Description:
 The functions to fetch e-mail via POP3 or IMAP as well as sending e-mail
 via SMTP use OpenSSL for static SSL or TLS based communication. As the
 SSL_get_verify_result() function is not used the certificated is trusted
 always and it can not be ensured that the certificate satisfies all
 necessary security requirements. This could allow an attacker to use an
 invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, use expired
 certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be detected if the
 certificate is properly validated. This issue affects OTRS: from 7.0.X
 before 7.0.47, from 8.0.X before 8.0.37; ((OTRS)) Community Edition: from
 6.0.X through 6.0.34.
