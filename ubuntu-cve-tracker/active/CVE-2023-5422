Description:
 The functions to fetch e-mail via POP3 or IMAP as well as sending e-mail
 via SMTP use OpenSSL for static SSL or TLS based communication. As the
 SSL_get_verify_result() function is not used the certificated is trusted
 always and it can not be ensured that the certificate
 satisfies all necessary security requirements.
 
 This could allow an
 attacker to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host,
 use expired certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be
 detected if the certificate is properly validated.
 
 This issue affects OTRS: from 7.0.X before 7.0.47, from 8.0.X before
 8.0.37; ((OTRS)) Community Edition: from 6.0.X through 6.0.34.
