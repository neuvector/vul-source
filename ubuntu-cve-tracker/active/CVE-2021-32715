Description:
 hyper is an HTTP library for rust. hyper's HTTP/1 server code had a flaw
 that incorrectly parses and accepts requests with a `Content-Length` header
 with a prefixed plus sign, when it should have been rejected as illegal.
 This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn't parse such
 `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can result in "request
 smuggling" or "desync attacks". The flaw exists in all prior versions of
 hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built with `rustc` v1.5.0 or newer. The
 vulnerability is patched in hyper version 0.14.10. Two workarounds exist:
 One may reject requests manually that contain a plus sign prefix in the
 `Content-Length` header or ensure any upstream proxy handles
 `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign prefix.
