Description:
 When doing TLS related transfers with re-used easy or multi handles and
 altering the `CURLSSLOPT_NO_PARTIALCHAIN` option, libcurl could accidentally
 reuse a CA store cached in memory for which the partial chain option was
 reversed. Contrary to the user's wishes and expectations. This could make
 libcurl find and accept a trust chain that it otherwise would not.
