Description:
 Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. When
 Axios prior to versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 runs on Node.js and is given a
 URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node
 http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and
 returns a synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` /
 `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can
 supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded
 memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType:
 'stream'`. Versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 contain a patch for the issue.
