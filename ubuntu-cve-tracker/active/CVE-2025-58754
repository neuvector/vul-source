Description:
 Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. When
 Axios prior to version 1.11.0 runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the
 `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter
 decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a
 synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` /
 `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can
 supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded
 memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType:
 'stream'`. Version 1.11.0 contains a patch for the issue.
