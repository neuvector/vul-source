Description:
 In WriteOnePNGImage() of the PNG coder at coders/png.c, an improper call to
 AcquireVirtualMemory() and memset() allows for an out-of-bounds write later
 when PopShortPixel() from MagickCore/quantum-private.h is called. The patch
 fixes the calls by adding 256 to rowbytes. An attacker who is able to
 supply a specially crafted image could affect availability with a low
 impact to data integrity. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to
 6.9.10-68 and 7.0.8-68.
