Description:
 AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. In versions 3.13.2 and below, handling of chunked messages can
 result in excessive blocking CPU usage when receiving a large number of
 chunks. If an application makes use of the request.read() method in an
 endpoint, it may be possible for an attacker to cause the server to spend a
 moderate amount of blocking CPU time (e.g. 1 second) while processing the
 request. This could potentially lead to DoS as the server would be unable
 to handle other requests during that time. This issue is fixed in version
 3.13.3.
