Description:
 HHVM 4.172.0 and all prior versions use TLS 1.0 for secure connections when
 handling tls:// URLs in the stream extension. TLS1.0 has numerous published
 vulnerabilities and is deprecated. HHVM 4.153.4, 4.168.2, 4.169.2, 4.170.2,
 4.171.1, 4.172.1, 4.173.0 replaces TLS1.0 with TLS1.3. Applications that
 call stream_socket_server or stream_socket_client functions with a URL
 starting with tls:// are affected.
