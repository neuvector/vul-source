Description:
 A flaw was found in GDM in versions prior to 3.38.2.1. A race condition in
 the handling of session shutdown makes it possible to bypass the lock
 screen for a user that has autologin enabled, accessing their session
 without authentication. This is similar to CVE-2017-12164, but requires
 more difficult conditions to exploit.
