 https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/a1c07906d8dcaf7957e5cc97f5cdbac7d18a205a (8.5.83)
Description:
 If Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.82, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.67, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.26
 or 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0 was configured to ignore invalid HTTP headers via
 setting rejectIllegalHeader to false (the default for 8.5.x only), Tomcat
 did not reject a request containing an invalid Content-Length header making
 a request smuggling attack possible if Tomcat was located behind a reverse
 proxy that also failed to reject the request with the invalid header.
