Description:
 SchedMD Slurm before 24.05.4 has Incorrect Authorization. A mistake in
 authentication handling in stepmgr could permit an attacker to execute
 processes under other users' jobs. This is limited to jobs explicitly
 running with --stepmgr, or on systems that have globally enabled stepmgr
 via SlurmctldParameters=enable_stepmgr in their configuration.
