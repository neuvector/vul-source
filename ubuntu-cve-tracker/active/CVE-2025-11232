Description:
 To trigger the issue, three configuration parameters must have specific
 settings: "hostname-char-set" must be left at the default setting, which is
 "[^A-Za-z0-9.-]"; "hostname-char-replacement" must be empty (the default);
 and "ddns-qualifying-suffix" must *NOT* be empty (the default is empty).
 DDNS updates do not need to be enabled for this issue to manifest. A client
 that sends certain option content would then cause kea-dhcp4 to exit
 unexpectedly.
 This issue affects Kea versions 3.0.1 through 3.0.1 and 3.1.1 through
 3.1.2.
