Description:
 Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps
 developers build websites and apps. The gatsby-transformer-remark plugin
 prior to versions 5.25.1 and 6.3.2 passes input through to the
 `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in
 its default configuration, unless input is sanitized. The vulnerability is
 present in gatsby-transformer-remark when passing input in data mode
 (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL). Injected JavaScript executes
 in the context of the build server. To exploit this vulnerability
 untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced by or added into a
 file processed by gatsby-transformer-remark. A patch has been introduced in
 `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1` and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2`
 which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript
 Frontmatter engine. As a workaround, if an older version of
 `gatsby-transformer-remark` must be used, input passed into the plugin
 should be sanitized ahead of processing. It is encouraged for projects to
 upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure
 the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.
