Description:
 A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the WebP Image Decoding
 functionality of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When loading a
 specially crafted .webp animation an integer overflow can be made to occur
 when calculating the stride for decoding. Afterwards, this will cause a
 heap-based buffer to overflow when decoding the image which can lead to
 remote code execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to
 read a file to trigger this vulnerability.
