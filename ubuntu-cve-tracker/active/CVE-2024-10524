Description:
 Applications that use Wget to access a remote resource using shorthand URLs
 and pass arbitrary user credentials in the URL are vulnerable. In these
 cases attackers can enter crafted credentials which will cause Wget to
 access an arbitrary host.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the upstream fix removes shorthand support for URLs. Fixing this
 mdeslaur> will change behaviour and may break existing uses of wget.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> This is only an issue when using a wget shorthand format URL
 mdeslaur> with user-provided input, which should be an uncommon scenario.
