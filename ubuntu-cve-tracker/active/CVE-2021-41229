Description:
 BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a
 vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which
 will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be
 freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very
 large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp
 packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.
