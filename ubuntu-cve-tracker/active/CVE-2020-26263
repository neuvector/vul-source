Description:
 tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS
 cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and
 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA
 PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has
 multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext.
 It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS
 servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the
 RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions
 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the
 individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case
 (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are
 recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security
 policy of tlslite-ng.
