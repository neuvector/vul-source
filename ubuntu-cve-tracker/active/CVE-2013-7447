Description:
 Integer overflow in the gdk_cairo_set_source_pixbuf function in
 gdk/gdkcairo.c in GTK+ before 3.9.8, as used in eom, gnome-photos, eog,
 gambas3, thunar, pinpoint, and possibly other applications, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large image file,
 which triggers a large memory allocation.
