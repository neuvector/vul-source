Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2. When reading data from a squash4 filesystem,
 grub's squash4 fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the
 filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it
 improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciously crafted filesystem
 may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to
 perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a
 result, the direct_read() will perform a heap based out-of-bounds write
 during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal
 critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure
 boot protections.

Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
