Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the FascistGecosUser function in
 lib/fascist.c in cracklib allows local users to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or gain privileges via a long GECOS field, involving
 longbuffer.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Ubuntu's chfn limits the total GECOS field length to 84 characters
  which is well within cracklib2's buffer size of 2048.
 tyhicks> libpam-cracklib is not part of the default install so PAM cracklib
  support is not enabled in the majority of Ubuntu installs
 tyhicks> Ubuntu's /etc/login.defs only allows unprivileged users to set their
  room number, work phone, and home phone
