Description:
 Git is a revision control system. Using a specially-crafted repository, Git
 prior to versions 2.39.2, 2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7,
 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and 2.30.8 can be tricked into using its local clone
 optimization even when using a non-local transport. Though Git will abort
 local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic
 links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These
 two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the
 victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy,
 allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253. A fix
 has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5
 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is
 impractical, two short-term workarounds are available. Avoid cloning
 repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`. Instead,
 consider cloning repositories without recursively cloning their submodules,
 and instead run `git submodule update` at each layer. Before doing so,
 inspect each new `.gitmodules` file to ensure that it does not contain
 suspicious module URLs.
