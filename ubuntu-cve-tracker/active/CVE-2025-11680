Description:
 Out-of-bounds Write in unfilter_scanline in warmcat libwebsockets allows,
 when the LWS_WITH_UPNG flag is enabled during compilation and the HTML
 display stack is used, to write past a heap allocated buffer possibly
 causing a crash, when the user visits an attacker controlled website that
 contains a crafted PNG file with a big width value that causes an integer
 overflow which value is used for determining the size of a heap allocation.
