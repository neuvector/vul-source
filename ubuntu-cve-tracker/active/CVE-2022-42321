Description:
 Xenstore: Guests can crash xenstored via exhausting the stack Xenstored is
 using recursion for some Xenstore operations (e.g. for deleting a sub-tree
 of Xenstore nodes). With sufficiently deep nesting levels this can result
 in stack exhaustion on xenstored, leading to a crash of xenstored.
