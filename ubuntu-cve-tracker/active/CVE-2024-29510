Description:
 Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.1 allows memory corruption, and SAFER
 sandbox bypass, via format string injection with a uniprint device.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sayun> the fix for this issue depends on SAFER infrastructure changes
   that were introduced after the 9.26 versions in bionic and xenial.
   Attempting to pull back infrastructure piecemeal runs the risk
   of introducing regressions; we may need to pull back 9.50 version
   included in focal/20.04 LTS to bionic and xenial.
