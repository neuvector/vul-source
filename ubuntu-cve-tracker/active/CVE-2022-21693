Description:
 OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
 share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In
 affected versions an adversary with a primitive that allows for filesystem
 access from the context of the Onionshare process can access sensitive
 files in the entire user home folder. This could lead to the leaking of
 sensitive data. Due to the automatic exclusion of hidden folders, the
 impact is reduced. This can be mitigated by usage of the flatpak release.
