Description:
 This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set "super cookies" in curl
 that are then passed back to more origins than what is otherwise allowed or
 possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to
 different and unrelated sites and domains. It could do this by exploiting a
 mixed case flaw in curl's function that verifies a given cookie domain
 against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For example a cookie could be set
 with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower case hostname `curl.co.uk`,
 even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain.
