Description:
 Buildx is a Docker CLI plugin that extends build capabilities using
 BuildKit.
 
 Cache backends support credentials by setting secrets directly as attribute
 values in cache-to/cache-from configuration. When supplied as user input,
 these secure values may be inadvertently captured in OpenTelemetry traces
 as part of the arguments and flags for the traced CLI
 command. OpenTelemetry traces are also saved in BuildKit daemon's history
 records.
 
 
 This vulnerability does not impact secrets passed to the Github cache
 backend via environment variables or registry authentication.
