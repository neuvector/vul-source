Description:
 A flaw has been found in Kamailio 5.5. The impacted element is the function
 rve_is_constant of the file src/core/rvalue.c. This manipulation causes
 null pointer dereference. The attack needs to be launched locally. The
 exploit has been published and may be used. It is still unclear if this
 vulnerability genuinely exists. This attack requires manipulating config
 files which might not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was
 contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.
