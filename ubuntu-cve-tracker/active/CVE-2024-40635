Description:
 containerd is an open-source container runtime. A bug was found in
 containerd prior to versions 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.0.4 where containers
 launched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit
 signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container
 ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for
 environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug
 has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04. As a workaround,
 ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have
 permissions to import images.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> Traditionally the containerd source package contained both the
 alexmurray> library and docker application. However, in releases that
 alexmurray> contain the
 alexmurray> containerd-app source package, the containerd source package
 alexmurray> contains only
 alexmurray> the library whilst the docker application itself is contained
 alexmurray> in the
 alexmurray> containerd-app package.
