Description:
 pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version
 6.1.3, an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads
 to large memory usage. This requires parsing the content stream of a page
 using the LZWDecode filter. This has been fixed in pypdf version 6.1.3.
