Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A bounds check common to
 most operation time functions specific to FIFO event channels depends on
 the CPU observing consistent state. While the producer side uses
 appropriately ordered writes, the consumer side isn't protected against
 re-ordered reads, and may hence end up de-referencing a NULL pointer.
 Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
 affecting the entire system. Only Arm systems may be vulnerable. Whether a
 system is vulnerable depends on the specific CPU. x86 systems are not
 vulnerable.
