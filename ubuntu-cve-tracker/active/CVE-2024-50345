Description:
 symfony/http-foundation is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which
 defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. The `Request`
 class, does not parse URI with special characters the same way browsers do.
 As a result, an attacker can trick a validator relying on the `Request`
 class to redirect users to another domain. The `Request::create` methods
 now assert the URI does not contain invalid characters as defined by
 https://url.spec.whatwg.org/. This issue has been patched in versions
 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
