Description:
 Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter for PHP. When parsing SVG images Dompdf
 performs an initial validation to ensure that paths within the SVG are
 allowed. One of the validations is that the SVG document does not reference
 itself. However, prior to version 2.0.4, a recursive chained using two or
 more SVG documents is not correctly validated. Depending on the system
 configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to
 the executing process and/or to the server itself.
 
 php-svg-lib, when run in isolation, does not support SVG references for
 `image` elements. However, when used in combination with Dompdf,
 php-svg-lib will process SVG images referenced by an `image` element.
 Dompdf currently includes validation to prevent self-referential `image`
 references, but a chained reference is not checked. A malicious actor may
 thus trigger infinite recursion by chaining references between two or more
 SVG images.
 
 When Dompdf parses a malicious payload, it will crash due after exceeding
 the allowed execution time or memory usage. An attacker sending multiple
 request to a system can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point
 that the system is unable to handle incoming request.
 
 Version 2.0.4 contains a fix for this issue.
