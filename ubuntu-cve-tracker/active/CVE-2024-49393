 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7204-1
Description:
 In neomutt and mutt, the To and Cc email headers are not validated by
 cryptographic signing which allows an attacker that intercepts a message to
 change their value and include himself as a one of the recipients to
 compromise message confidentiality.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 john-breton| Mutt project does not plan to address CVE-2024-49393, 
  CVE-2024-49394, and CVE-2024-49395.
 john-breton| Given the large structural changes to NeoMutt, a fix
  for bionic is likely infeasible and not worth the effort.
Mitigation:
Bugs:
Priority: low
 This is a longstanding limitation of PGP-encrypted mail and is an 
 enhancement rather than an actual vulnerability.
