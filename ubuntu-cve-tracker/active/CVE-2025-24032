Description:
 PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate
 based user login. Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none
 (the default value), then pam_pkcs11 will only check if the user is capable
 of logging into the token. An attacker may create a different token with
 the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to the
 attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the
 attacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to
 *not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commit
 commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions
 starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in
 `pam_pkcs11.conf`, set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.
