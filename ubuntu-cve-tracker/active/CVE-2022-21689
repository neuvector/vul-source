Description:
 OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
 share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In
 affected versions the receive mode limits concurrent uploads to 100 per
 second and blocks other uploads in the same second, which can be triggered
 by a simple script. An adversary with access to the receive mode can block
 file upload for others. There is no way to block this attack in public mode
 due to the anonymity properties of the tor network.
