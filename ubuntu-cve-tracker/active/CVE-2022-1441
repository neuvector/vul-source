Description:
 MP4Box is a component of GPAC-2.0.0, which is a widely-used third-party
 package on RPM Fusion. When MP4Box tries to parse a MP4 file, it calls the
 function `diST_box_read()` to read from video. In this function, it
 allocates a buffer `str` with fixed length. However, content read from `bs`
 is controllable by user, so is the length, which causes a buffer overflow.
