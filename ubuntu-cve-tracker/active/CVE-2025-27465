Description:
 Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In some
 cases Xen emulates the instruction by replaying it, using an executable
 stub.  Some instructions may raise an exception, which is supposed to be
 handled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have additional logic
 to set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.
 
 For replayed instructions where the flags recovery logic is used, the
 metadata for exception handling was incorrect, preventing Xen from
 handling the the exception gracefully, treating it as fatal instead.
