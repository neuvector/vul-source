Description:
 ACE vulnerability in JaninoEventEvaluator  by QOS.CH logback-core
       upto including version 0.1 to 1.3.14 andÂ 1.4.0 to 1.5.12 in Java
 applications allows
       attacker to execute arbitrary code by compromising an existing
       logback configuration file or by injecting an environment variable
       before program execution.
 
 
 
 
 
 Malicious logback configuration files can allow the attacker to execute
 arbitrary code using the JaninoEventEvaluator extension.
 
 
 
 A successful attack requires the user to have write access to a
 configuration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious
 environment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both
 cases, the attack requires existing privilege.
