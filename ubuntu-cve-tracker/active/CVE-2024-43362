Description:
 Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. The
 `fileurl` parameter is not properly sanitized when saving external links in
 `links.php` . Morever, the said fileurl is placed in some html code which
 is passed to the `print` function in `link.php` and `index.php`, finally
 leading to stored XSS. Users with the privilege to create external links
 can manipulate the `fileurl` parameter in the http post request while
 creating external links to perform stored XSS attacks. The vulnerability
 known as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) occurs when an application allows
 untrusted user input to be displayed on a web page without proper
 validation or escaping. This issue has been addressed in release version
 1.2.28. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
 for this issue.
