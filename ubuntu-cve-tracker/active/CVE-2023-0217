Description:
 An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application
 tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check()
 function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. This function
 can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could
 allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack. The TLS
 implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but applications
 might call the function if there are additional security requirements
 imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.
