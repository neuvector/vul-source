Description:
 Spring Security, versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5 and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9 could
 be susceptible to authorization rules bypass via forward or include
 dispatcher types. Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of
 the following are true: The application expects that Spring Security
 applies security to forward and include dispatcher types. The application
 uses the AuthorizationFilter either manually or via the
 authorizeHttpRequests() method. The application configures the
 FilterChainProxy to apply to forward and/or include requests (e.g.
 spring.security.filter.dispatcher-types = request, error, async, forward,
 include). The application may forward or include the request to a higher
 privilege-secured endpoint.The application configures Spring Security to
 apply to every dispatcher type via
 authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)
