Description:
 containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in
 containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the
 host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal
 resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch
 due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting
 to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and
 crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and
 the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been
 fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16.  Users should update to these
 versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that
 only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have
 permissions to execute commands in running containers.
