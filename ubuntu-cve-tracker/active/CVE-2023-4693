Description:
 An out-of-bounds read flaw was found on grub2's NTFS filesystem driver.
 This issue may allow a physically present attacker to present a specially
 crafted NTFS file system image to read arbitrary memory locations. A
 successful attack allows sensitive data cached in memory or EFI variable
 values to be leaked, presenting a high Confidentiality risk.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that a specially crafted file system image could cause an
 out-of-bounds read. A local attacker could possibly use this to leak sensitive
 information to the GRUB pager.
Notes:
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes
 eslerm> the grub2 package unlikely affects Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2 and grub2-unsigned should have same major version
 eslerm| Ubuntu Secure Boot and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel
  cannot handle new versions of grub
 eslerm| Note that key revocation is required to protect against evil
  housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
 eslerm> CWE-125
