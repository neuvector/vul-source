Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In pgjdbc before 42.3.3, an attacker (who controls the jdbc
 URL or properties) can call java.util.logging.FileHandler to write to
 arbitrary files through the loggerFile and loggerLevel connection
 properties. An example situation is that an attacker could create an
 executable JSP file under a Tomcat web root. NOTE: the vendor's position is
 that there is no pgjdbc vulnerability; instead, it is a vulnerability for
 any application to use the pgjdbc driver with untrusted connection
 properties.
