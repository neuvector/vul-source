Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An
 authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate the
 garbage collector and potentially lead to remote code execution. The
 problem is fixed in 7.4.2, 7.2.7, and 6.2.17. An additional workaround to
 mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to
 prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to
 restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.
