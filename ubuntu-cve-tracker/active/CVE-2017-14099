Description:
 In res/res_rtp_asterisk.c in Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before
 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before
 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized data disclosure
 (media takeover in the RTP stack) is possible with careful timing by an
 attacker. The "strictrtp" option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the RTP
 stack that learns the source address of media for a session and drops any
 packets that do not originate from the expected address. This option is
 enabled by default in Asterisk 11 and above. The "nat" and "rtp_symmetric"
 options (for chan_sip and chan_pjsip, respectively) enable symmetric RTP
 support in the RTP stack. This uses the source address of incoming media as
 the target address of any sent media. This option is not enabled by
 default, but is commonly enabled to handle devices behind NAT. A change was
 made to the strict RTP support in the RTP stack to better tolerate late
 media when a reinvite occurs. When combined with the symmetric RTP support,
 this introduced an avenue where media could be hijacked. Instead of only
 learning a new address when expected, the new code allowed a new source
 address to be learned at all times. If a flood of RTP traffic was received,
 the strict RTP support would allow the new address to provide media, and
 (with symmetric RTP enabled) outgoing traffic would be sent to this new
 address, allowing the media to be hijacked. Provided the attacker continued
 to send traffic, they would continue to receive traffic as well.
