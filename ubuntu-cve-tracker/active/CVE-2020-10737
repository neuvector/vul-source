Description:
 A race condition was found in the mkhomedir tool shipped with the oddjob
 package in versions before 0.34.5 and 0.34.6 wherein, during the home
 creation, mkhomedir copies the /etc/skel directory into the newly created
 home and changes its ownership to the home's user without properly checking
 the homedir path. This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this issue by
 creating a symlink point to a target folder, which then has its ownership
 transferred to the new home directory's unprivileged user.
