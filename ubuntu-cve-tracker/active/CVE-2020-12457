Description:
 An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 4.5.0. It mishandles the
 change_cipher_spec (CCS) message processing logic for TLS 1.3. If an
 attacker sends ChangeCipherSpec messages in a crafted way involving more
 than one in a row, the server becomes stuck in the ProcessReply() loop,
 i.e., a denial of service.
