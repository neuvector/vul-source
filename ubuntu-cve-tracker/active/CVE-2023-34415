Description:
 When choosing a site-isolated process for a document loaded from a data:
 URL that was the result of a redirect, Firefox would load that document in
 the same process as the site that issued the redirect. This bypassed the
 site-isolation protections against Spectre-like attacks on sites that host
 an "open redirect". Firefox no longer follows HTTP redirects to data: URLs.
 This vulnerability affects Firefox < 114.
