Description:
 A flaw was found in openCryptoki. The openCryptoki Soft token does not
 check if an EC key is valid when an EC key is created via C_CreateObject,
 nor when C_DeriveKey is used with ECDH public data. This may allow a
 malicious user to extract the private key by performing an invalid curve
 attack.
