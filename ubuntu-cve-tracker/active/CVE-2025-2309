Description:
 A vulnerability has been found in HDF5 1.14.6 and classified as critical.
 This vulnerability affects the function H5T__bit_copy of the component Type
 Conversion Logic. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow.
 Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been
 disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this
 vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The vendor was contacted
 early about a batch of vulnerabilities. His response was "reject" without
 further explanation. We have not received an elaboration even after asking
 politely for further details. Currently we assume that the vendor wants to
 "dispute" the entries which is why they are flagged as such until further
 details become available.
