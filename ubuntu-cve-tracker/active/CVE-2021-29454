Description:
 Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of
 presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42
 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a
 malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided
 data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by
 crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or
 4.0.2 to receive a patch.
