Description:
 lock order inversion in transitive grant copy handling As part of XSA-226 a
 missing cleanup call was inserted on an error handling path. While doing
 so, locking requirements were not paid attention to. As a result two
 cooperating guests granting each other transitive grants can cause locks to
 be acquired nested within one another, but in respectively opposite order.
 With suitable timing between the involved grant copy operations this may
 result in the locking up of a CPU.
