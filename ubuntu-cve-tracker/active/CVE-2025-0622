Description:
 A flaw was found in command/gpg. In some scenarios, hooks created by loaded
 modules are not removed when the related module is unloaded. This flaw
 allows an attacker to force grub2 to call the hooks once the module that
 registered it was unloaded, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. If
 correctly exploited, this vulnerability may result in arbitrary code
 execution, eventually allowing the attacker to bypass secure boot
 protections.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
