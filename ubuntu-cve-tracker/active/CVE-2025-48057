Description:
 Icinga 2 is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network
 resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for
 reporting. Prior to versions 2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6, the
 VerifyCertificate() function can be tricked into incorrectly treating
 certificates as valid. This allows an attacker to send a malicious
 certificate request that is then treated as a renewal of an already
 existing certificate, resulting in the attacker obtaining a valid
 certificate that can be used to impersonate trusted nodes. This only occurs
 when Icinga 2 is built with OpenSSL older than version 1.1.0. This issue
 has been patched in versions 2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6.
