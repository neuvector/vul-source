Description:
 ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Neutralization of
 Expression/Command Delimiters vulnerability in Apache Commons OGNL.
 
 This issue affects Apache Commons OGNL: all versions.
 
 
 
 When using the API Ognl.getValueâ€‹, the OGNL engine parses and evaluates the
 provided expression with powerful capabilities, including accessing and
 invoking related methods,
  etc. Although OgnlRuntime attempts to restrict certain dangerous classes
 and methods (such as java.lang.Runtime) through a blocklist, these
 restrictions are not comprehensive.
 Attackers may be able to bypass the restrictions by leveraging class
 objects that are not covered by the blocklist and potentially achieve
 arbitrary code execution.
 
 As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes
 this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access
 to the instance to trusted users.
 
 
 NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported
 by the maintainer.
