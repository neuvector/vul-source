Description:
 A vulnerability in the PyTorch's torch.distributed.rpc framework,
 specifically in versions prior to 2.2.2, allows for remote code execution
 (RCE). The framework, which is used in distributed training scenarios, does
 not properly verify the functions being called during RPC (Remote Procedure
 Call) operations. This oversight permits attackers to execute arbitrary
 commands by leveraging built-in Python functions such as eval during
 multi-cpu RPC communication. The vulnerability arises from the lack of
 restriction on function calls when a worker node serializes and sends a
 PythonUDF (User Defined Function) to the master node, which then
 deserializes and executes the function without validation. This flaw can be
 exploited to compromise master nodes initiating distributed training,
 potentially leading to the theft of sensitive AI-related data.
