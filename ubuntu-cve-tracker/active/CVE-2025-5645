Description:
 A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Radare2
 5.9.9. This affects the function r_cons_pal_init in the library
 /libr/cons/pal.c of the component radiff2. The manipulation of the argument
 -T leads to memory corruption. Attacking locally is a requirement. The
 complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be
 difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
 The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment.
 The identifier of the patch is 5705d99cc1f23f36f9a84aab26d1724010b97798. It
 is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The documentation
 explains that the parameter -T is experimental and "crashy". Further
 analysis has shown "the race is not a real problem unless you use asan". A
 new warning has been added.
