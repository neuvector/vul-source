 unsigned char max characters. This value is used as an index to copy memory
 causing in an out of bounds memory write error.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled interactive response
 messages length. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
 execute arbitrary code.
