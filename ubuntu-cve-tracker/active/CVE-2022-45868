Description:
 The web-based admin console in H2 Database Engine through 2.1.214 can be
 started via the CLI with the argument -webAdminPassword, which allows the
 user to specify the password in cleartext for the web admin console.
 Consequently, a local user (or an attacker that has obtained local access
 through some means) would be able to discover the password by listing
 processes and their arguments. NOTE: the vendor states "This is not a
 vulnerability of H2 Console ... Passwords should never be passed on the
 command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to
 know that."
