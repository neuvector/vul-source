Description:
 A defect was discovered in the Python “ssl” module where there is a memory
 race condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods “cert_store_stats()” and
 “get_ca_certs()”. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are
 called at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext,
 such as during the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured.
 This issue is fixed in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.
