Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mailman Core before 3.3.5. An attacker with
 access to the REST API could use timing attacks to determine the value of
 the configured REST API password and then make arbitrary REST API calls.
 The REST API is bound to localhost by default, limiting the ability for
 attackers to exploit this, but can optionally be made to listen on other
 interfaces.
