Description:
 A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the HTTP Connection Headers
 parsing in Tinyproxy 1.11.1 and Tinyproxy 1.10.0. A specially crafted HTTP
 header can trigger reuse of previously freed memory, which leads to memory
 corruption and could lead to remote code execution. An attacker needs to
 make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.
