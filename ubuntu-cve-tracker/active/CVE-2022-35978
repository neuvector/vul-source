Description:
 Minetest is a free open-source voxel game engine with easy modding and game
 creation. In **single player**, a mod can set a global setting that
 controls the Lua script loaded to display the main menu. The script is then
 loaded as soon as the game session is exited. The Lua environment the menu
 runs in is not sandboxed and can directly interfere with the user's system.
 There are currently no known workarounds.
