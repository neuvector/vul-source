Description:
 WordPress Core is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and
 including, 6.2, via the ‘wp_lang’ parameter. This allows unauthenticated
 attackers to access and load arbitrary translation files. In cases where an
 attacker is able to upload a crafted translation file onto the site, such
 as via an upload form, this could be also used to perform a Cross-Site
 Scripting attack.
