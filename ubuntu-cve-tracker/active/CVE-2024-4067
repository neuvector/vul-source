 https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/blob/2c56a8604b68c1099e7bc0f807ce0865a339747a/index.js#L448
Description:
 The NPM package `micromatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of
 Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in
 `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By
 passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to
 the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size
 increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the
 application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further
 testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a
 safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to
 greedy matching.
