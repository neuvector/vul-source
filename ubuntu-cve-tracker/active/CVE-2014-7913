Description:
 The print_option function in dhcp-common.c in dhcpcd through 6.9.1, as used
 in dhcp.c in dhcpcd 5.x in Android before 5.1 and other products,
 misinterprets the return value of the snprintf function, which allows
 remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
 (memory corruption) via a crafted message.
