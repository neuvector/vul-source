Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.18,
 Rack::QueryParser enforces its params_limit only for parameters separated
 by &, while still splitting on both & and ;. As a result, attackers could
 use ; separators to bypass the parameter count limit and submit more
 parameters than intended. Applications or middleware that directly invoke
 Rack::QueryParser with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter)
 could be exposed to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be
 abused as a limited denial-of-service vector. This issue has been patched
 in version 2.2.18.
