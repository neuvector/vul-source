Description:
 Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify
 elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit
 encoding of the parameters.  Prior to 3.5.0 and 2.19.5, checking name
 constraints in X.509 certificates is quadratic in the number of names and
 name constraints. An attacker who presented a certificate chain which
 contained a very large number of names in the SubjectAlternativeName,
 signed by a CA certificate which contained a large number of name
 constraints, could cause a denial of service. The problem has been
 addressed in Botan 3.5.0 and a partial backport has also been applied and
 is included in Botan 2.19.5.
