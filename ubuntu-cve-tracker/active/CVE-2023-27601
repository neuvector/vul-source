Description:
 OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
 Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP
 body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in the
 sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function with
 an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\n`). The
 vulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an
 OpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions
 `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also
 discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function
 `codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function
 `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed
 (`\n`): By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the
 server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the
 affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the
 sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation of
 this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function,
 resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue has been fixed in versions
 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.
