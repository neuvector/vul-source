Description:
 Improper permission check in ZooKeeper AdminServer lets authorized clients
 to run snapshot and restore command with insufficient permissions.
 
 This issue affects Apache ZooKeeper: from 3.9.0 before 3.9.4.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.4, which fixes the issue.
 
 The issue can be mitigated by disabling both commands (via
 admin.snapshot.enabled and admin.restore.enabled), disabling the whole
 AdminServer interface (via admin.enableServer), or ensuring that the root
 ACL does not provide open permissions. (Note that ZooKeeper ACLs are not
 recursive, so this does not impact operations on child nodes besides
 notifications from recursive watches.)
