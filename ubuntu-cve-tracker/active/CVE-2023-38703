Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a
 higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media
 transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not
 synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce
 use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have
 SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media
 transport other than UDP. This vulnerability’s impact may range from
 unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory
 corruption. The patch is available as a commit in the master branch.
