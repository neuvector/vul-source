Description:
 FontForge SFD File Parsing Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code on affected installations of FontForge. User
 interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
 must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SFD files. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result
 in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this
 vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was
 ZDI-CAN-28198.
