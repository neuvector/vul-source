Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Moodle 3.10.1 is vulnerable to persistent/stored cross-site
 scripting (XSS) due to the improper input sanitization on the "Additional
 HTML Section" via "Header and Footer" parameter in /admin/settings.php.
 This vulnerability is leading an attacker to steal admin and all user
 account cookies by storing the malicious XSS payload in Header and Footer.
 NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because the "Additional HTML Section"
 for "Header and Footer" can only be supplied by an administrator, who is
 intentionally allowed to enter unsanitized input (e.g., site-specific
 JavaScript).
