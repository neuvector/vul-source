Description:
 A flaw was found in several ansible modules, where parameters containing
 credentials, such as secrets, were being logged in plain-text on managed
 nodes, as well as being made visible on the controller node when run in
 verbose mode. These parameters were not protected by the no_log feature. An
 attacker can take advantage of this information to steal those credentials,
 provided when they have access to the log files containing them. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This
 flaw affects Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform in versions before 1.2.2
 and Ansible Tower in versions before 3.8.2.
