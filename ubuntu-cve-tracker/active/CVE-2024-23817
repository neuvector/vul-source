Description:
 Dolibarr is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship
 management (CRM) software package. Version 18.0.4 has a HTML Injection
 vulnerability in the Home page of the Dolibarr Application. This
 vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags and
 manipulate the rendered content in the application's response.
 Specifically, I was able to successfully inject a new HTML tag into the
 returned document and, as a result, was able to comment out some part of
 the Dolibarr App Home page HTML code. This behavior can be exploited to
 perform various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). To remediate the
 issue, validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially within
 HTML attributes, to prevent HTML injection attacks; and implement proper
 output encoding when rendering user-provided data to ensure it is treated
 as plain text rather than executable HTML.
