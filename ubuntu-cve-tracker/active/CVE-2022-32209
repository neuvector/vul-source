Description:
 # Possible XSS Vulnerability in Rails::Html::SanitizerThere is a possible
 XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
 Rails::Html::Sanitizer.This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
 identifier CVE-2022-32209.Versions Affected: ALLNot affected: NONEFixed
 Versions: v1.4.3## ImpactA possible XSS vulnerability with certain
 configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject
 content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed
 tags to allow both `select` and `style` elements.Code is only impacted if
 allowed tags are being overridden. This may be done via application
 configuration:```ruby# In
 config/application.rbconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["select",
 "style"]```see
 https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-viewOr
 it may be done with a `:tags` option to the Action View helper
 `sanitize`:```<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["select", "style"]
 %>```see
 https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitizeOr
 it may be done with Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer directly:```ruby#
 class-level optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["select",
 "style"]```or```ruby# instance-level
 optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags:
 ["select", "style"])```All users overriding the allowed tags by any of the
 above mechanisms to include both "select" and "style" should either upgrade
 or use one of the workarounds immediately.## ReleasesThe FIXED releases are
 available at the normal locations.## WorkaroundsRemove either `select` or
 `style` from the overridden allowed tags.## CreditsThis vulnerability was
