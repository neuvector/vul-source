 https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/commit/91a654dfa4de0c48aa222b87bfb909f9f21b03e0 (master)
Description:
 ACL configured in ip_allow.config or remap.config does not use IP addresses
 that are provided by PROXY protocol.
 
 Users can use a new setting (proxy.config.acl.subjects) to choose which IP
 addresses to use for the ACL if Apache Traffic Server is configured to
 accept PROXY protocol.Â 
 This issue affects undefined: from 10.0.0 through 10.0.6, from 9.0.0
 through 9.2.10.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.2.11 or 10.0.6, which fixes
 the issue.
