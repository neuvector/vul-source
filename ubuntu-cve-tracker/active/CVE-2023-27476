Description:
 OWSLib is a Python package for client programming with Open Geospatial
 Consortium (OGC) web service interface standards, and their related content
 models. OWSLib's XML parser (which supports both `lxml` and `xml.etree`)
 does not disable entity resolution, and could lead to arbitrary file reads
 from an attacker-controlled XML payload. This affects all XML parsing in
 the codebase. This issue has been addressed in version 0.28.1. All users
 are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround is to patch the library
 manually. See `GHSA-8h9c-r582-mggc` for details.
