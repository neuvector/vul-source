Description:
 graphql-go is a GraphQL server with a focus on ease of use. In versions
 prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a
 bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed
 queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL
 handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn
 could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its
 users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known
 workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from
 your schema which is not recommended.
