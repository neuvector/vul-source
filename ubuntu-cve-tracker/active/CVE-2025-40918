Description:
 Authen::SASL::Perl::DIGEST_MD5 versions 2.04 through 2.1800 for Perl
 generates the cnonce insecurely.
 
 The cnonce (client nonce) is generated from an MD5 hash of the PID, the
 epoch time and the built-in rand function. The PID will come from a small
 set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from
 the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for
 cryptographic usage.
 
 According to RFC 2831, The cnonce-value is an opaque quoted string value
 provided by the client and used by both client and server to avoid chosen
 plaintext attacks, and to provide mutual authentication. The security of
 the implementation
  depends on a good choice. It is RECOMMENDED that it contain at least 64
 bits of entropy.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> The upstream fix for this issue would require introducing a new
 mdeslaur> dependency on the libcrypt-urandom-perl package, which is in
 mdeslaur> universe.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism has been marked as OBSOLETE in 2011
 mdeslaur> by RFC6331, is insecure, and should not be used in production
 mdeslaur> environments.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Since this mechanism is insecure, with or without the fix for
 mdeslaur> this vulnerability, marking proority as "low."
Mitigation:
 The DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism is insecure and has been marked as OBSOLETE
 since 2011. We recommend using a more recent and secure mechanism in
 production environments.
