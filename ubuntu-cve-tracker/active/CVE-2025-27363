Description:
 An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below when
 attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and
 variable font files. The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an
 unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and
 allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed
 long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in
 arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the
 wild.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> per post on oss-security list: "This commit fixes most of the
 mdeslaur> issue - except "limit" is still signed short - but needs to be
 mdeslaur> redone if you're backporting to 2.10.4"
