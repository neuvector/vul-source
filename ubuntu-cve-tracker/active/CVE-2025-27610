Description:
 Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior
 to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, `Rack::Static` can serve files
 under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided, which may expose
 other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability
 occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied
 paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences
 are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the
 designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an
 attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:`
 directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file.
 Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other
 mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static`, or ensuring that
 `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should
 be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server
 would also mitigate the issue.
