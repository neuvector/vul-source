Description:
 The GitHub CLI is GitHub’s official command line tool. A security
 vulnerability has been identified in GitHub CLI that could create or
 overwrite files in unintended directories when users download a malicious
 GitHub Actions workflow artifact through gh run download. This
 vulnerability stems from a GitHub Actions workflow artifact named .. when
 downloaded using gh run download. The artifact name and --dir flag are used
 to determine the artifact’s download path. When the artifact is named ..,
 the resulting files within the artifact are extracted exactly 1 directory
 higher than the specified --dir flag value. This vulnerability is fixed in
 2.63.1.
