Description:
 notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI
 artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. The issue was identified
 during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
 based revocation check feature.
 After retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache
 using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to
 operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and
 destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to
 an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a
 temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually,
 Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the
 dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go
 documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS,
 it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation,
 moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted
 as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like
 RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint
 (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check
 based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature
 verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been
 addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There
 are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
