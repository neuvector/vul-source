Description:
 Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
 reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 2.0.0, 5.0.0, and 6.0.0 and
 prior to versions 4.4.51, 5.4.31, and 6.3.8, some Twig filters in
 CodeExtension use `is_safe=html` but don't actually ensure their input is
 safe. As of versions 4.4.51, 5.4.31, and 6.3.8, Symfony now escapes the
 output of the affected filters.
