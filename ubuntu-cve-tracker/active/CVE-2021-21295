Description:
 Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
 framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol
 servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version
 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. If a
 Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP/2 request, the field
 is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up. This is
 fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP/1.1. If the
 request comes in as an HTTP/2 stream, gets converted into the HTTP/1.1
 domain objects (`HttpRequest`, `HttpContent`, etc.) via
 `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec `and then sent up to the child channel's
 pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as HTTP/1.1 this may result in
 request smuggling. In a proxy case, users may assume the content-length is
 validated somehow, which is not the case. If the request is forwarded to a
 backend channel that is a HTTP/1.1 connection, the Content-Length now has
 meaning and needs to be checked. An attacker can smuggle requests inside
 the body as it gets downgraded from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1. For an example
 attack refer to the linked GitHub Advisory. Users are only affected if all
 of this is true: `HTTP2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec` is used,
 `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to HTTP/1.1 objects,
 and these HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote peer. This has
 been patched in 4.1.60.Final As a workaround, the user can do the
 validation by themselves by implementing a custom `ChannelInboundHandler`
 that is put in the `ChannelPipeline` behind
 `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`.
