 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29424
Description:
 The Net::Netmask module before 2.0000 for Perl does not properly consider
 extraneous zero characters at the beginning of an IP address string, which
 (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is
 based on IP addresses.

Notes:
 seth-arnold> blog.urth.org reports many perl modules affected; I don't
  know if this CVE number applies to something else entirely, all of them,
  or just one of these packages.
