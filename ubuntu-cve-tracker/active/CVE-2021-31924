Description:
 Yubico pam-u2f before 1.1.1 has a logic issue that, depending on the
 pam-u2f configuration and the application used, could lead to a local PIN
 bypass. This issue does not allow user presence (touch) or cryptographic
 signature verification to be bypassed, so an attacker would still need to
 physically possess and interact with the YubiKey or another enrolled
 authenticator. If pam-u2f is configured to require PIN authentication, and
 the application using pam-u2f allows the user to submit NULL as the PIN,
 pam-u2f will attempt to perform a FIDO2 authentication without PIN. If this
 authentication is successful, the PIN requirement is bypassed.
