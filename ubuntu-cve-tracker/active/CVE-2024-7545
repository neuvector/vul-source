Description:
 oFono SimToolKit Heap-based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of oFono. An attacker must first
 obtain the ability to execute code on the target modem in order to exploit
 this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of STK command PDUs. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
 data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage
 this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.
 Was ZDI-CAN-23458.
