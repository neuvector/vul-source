Description:
 The openssl_private_decrypt function in PHP, when using PKCS1 padding
 (OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING, which is the default), is vulnerable to the Marvin
 Attack unless it is used with an OpenSSL version that includes the changes
 from this pull request: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13817
 (rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection). These changes are part of OpenSSL 3.2 and
 have also been backported to stable versions of various Linux
 distributions, as well as to the PHP builds provided for Windows since the
 previous release. All distributors and builders should ensure that this
 version is used to prevent PHP from being vulnerable. PHP Windows builds
 for the versions 8.1.29, 8.2.20 and 8.3.8 and above include OpenSSL patches
 that fix the vulnerability.
