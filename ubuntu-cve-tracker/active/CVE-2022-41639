Description:
 A heap based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in tile decoding code of
 TIFF image parser in OpenImageIO master-branch-9aeece7a and v2.3.19.0. A
 specially-crafted TIFF file can lead to an out of bounds memory corruption,
 which can result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a
 malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.
