Description:
 A heap overflow issue was found in Redis in versions before 5.0.10, before
 6.0.9 and before 6.2.0 when using a heap allocator other than jemalloc or
 glibc's malloc, leading to potential out of bound write or process crash.
 Effectively this flaw does not affect the vast majority of users, who use
 jemalloc or glibc malloc.
