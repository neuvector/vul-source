Description:
 OpenSearch is an open source distributed and RESTful search engine.
 OpenSearch uses JWTs to store role claims obtained from the Identity
 Provider (IdP) when the authentication backend is SAML or OpenID Connect.
 There is an issue in how those claims are processed from the JWTs where the
 leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed, allowing users to potentially
 claim roles they are not assigned to if any role matches the
 whitespace-stripped version of the roles they are a member of. This issue
 is only present for authenticated users, and it requires either the
 existence of roles that match, not considering leading/trailing whitespace,
 or the ability for users to create said matching roles. In addition, the
 Identity Provider must allow leading and trailing spaces in role names.
 OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1 are affected. Users are advised to
 upgrade to OpenSearch 1.3.8 or 2.5.0. There are no known workarounds for
 this issue.
