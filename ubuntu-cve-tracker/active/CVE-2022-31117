Description:
 UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with
 bindings for Python 3.7+. In versions prior to 5.4.0 an error occurring
 while reallocating a buffer for string decoding can cause the buffer to get
 freed twice. Due to how UltraJSON uses the internal decoder, this double
 free is impossible to trigger from Python. This issue has been resolved in
 version 5.4.0 and all users should upgrade to UltraJSON 5.4.0. There are no
 known workarounds for this issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> the embedded ujson code in pandas, eventhough containing similar
 ccdm94> content as the upstream ujson code, seems to have diverged from the
 ccdm94> ujson upstream project (they have fully forked ujson), since pandas
 ccdm94> upstream is maintaining their own ujson bug fixes and changes without
 ccdm94> re-syncing with the ujson upstream project. There is no indication
 ccdm94> the ujson fork, as used in pandas, is vulnerable to the same issues
 ccdm94> as the upstream ujson code.
