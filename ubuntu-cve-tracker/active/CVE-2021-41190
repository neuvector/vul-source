Description:
 The OCI Distribution Spec project defines an API protocol to facilitate and
 standardize the distribution of content. In the OCI Distribution
 Specification version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type header alone was
 used to determine the type of document during push and pull operations.
 Documents that contain both “manifests” and “layers” fields could be
 interpreted as either a manifest or an index in the absence of an
 accompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed between
 two pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content
 differently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to require
 that a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match the
 Content-Type header used during the push and pull operations. Clients
 pulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject an
 ambiguous document that contains both “manifests” and “layers” fields or
 “manifests” and “config” fields if they are unable to update to version
 1.0.1 of the spec.
