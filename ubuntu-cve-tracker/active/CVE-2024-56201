 https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.5
Description:
 Jinja is an extensible templating engine. In versions on the 3.x branch
 prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that
 controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary
 Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the
 vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the
 contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of
 application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications
 which execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose
 the template filename. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.
