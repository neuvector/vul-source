 https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.5
Description:
 Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the
 Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and
 filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if
 Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to
 control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is
 the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability
 impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the
 template author can also choose the template filename. This vulnerability
 is fixed in 3.1.5.
