Description:
 Heap buffer overflow in libr/bin/format/mach0/mach0.c in GitHub repository
 radareorg/radare2 prior to 5.8.6. If address sanitizer is disabled during
 the compiling, the program should executes into the `r_str_ncpy` function.
 Therefore I think it is very likely to be exploitable. For more general
 description of heap buffer overflow, see
 [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html).
