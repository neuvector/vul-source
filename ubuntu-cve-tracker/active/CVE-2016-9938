Description:
 An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 11.x before 11.25.1, 13.x
 before 13.13.1, and 14.x before 14.2.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before
 11.6-cert16 and 13.x before 13.8-cert4. The chan_sip channel driver has a
 liberal definition for whitespace when attempting to strip the content
 between a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than following RFC
 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any
 non-printable ASCII character as if it were whitespace. This means that
 headers such as Contact\x01: will be seen as a valid Contact header. This
 mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem with an
 authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination of valid and
 invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into
 Asterisk without authentication since it believes the request is an
 in-dialog request. However, because of the bug described above, the request
 will look like an out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then
 process the request as a new call. The result is that Asterisk can process
 calls from unvetted sources without any authentication. If you do not use a
 proxy for authentication, then this issue does not affect you. If your
 proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of what dialogs
 are currently valid), then this issue does not affect you. If you use
 chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not affect you.
