Description:
 backintime (aka Back in Time) before 1.1.24 did improper escaping/quoting
 of file paths used as arguments to the 'notify-send' command, leading to
 some parts of file paths being executed as shell commands within an
 os.system call in qt4/plugins/notifyplugin.py. This could allow an attacker
 to craft an unreadable file with a specific name to run arbitrary shell
 commands.
