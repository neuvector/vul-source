Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. Affected versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability
 regarding the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol. HTTP/1.1 is
 a persistent protocol, if both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE)
 header values are present it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two
 entities that parse the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this
 incorrect interpretation. A possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a
 configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE
 headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked, we
 can pass a chunked123 as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this header
 and will parse Content-Length. The impact of this vulnerability is that it
 is possible to bypass any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to other users like
 passing Authentication Headers, also if it is present an Open Redirect an
 attacker could combine it to redirect random users to another website and
 log the request. This vulnerability has been addressed in release 3.8.0 of
 aiohttp. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
 this vulnerability.
