Description:
 A heap-buffer-overflow flaw was found in the cfg_mark_ports function within
 Unbound's config_file.c, which can lead to memory corruption. This issue
 could allow an attacker with local access to provide specially crafted
 input, potentially causing the application to crash or allowing arbitrary
 code execution. This could result in a denial of service or unauthorized
 actions on the system.
