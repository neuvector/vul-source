Description:
 A flaw in Node.js 20's HTTP parser allows improper termination of HTTP/1
 headers using `\r\n\rX` instead of the required `\r\n\r\n`.
 This inconsistency enables request smuggling, allowing attackers to bypass
 proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests.
 
 The issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9, which enforces
 correct header termination.
 
 Impact:
 * This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp`
 v9 upgrade.
