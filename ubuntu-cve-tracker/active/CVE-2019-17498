Description:
 In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in
 packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to
 specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A
 crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a
 denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to
 the server.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled bound checks in
 SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
 cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information.
