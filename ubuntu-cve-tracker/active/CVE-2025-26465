Description:
 The OpenSSH client is vulnerable to an active machine-in-the-middle
 attack if the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled (it is disabled by
 default): when a vulnerable client connects to a server, an active
 machine-in-the-middle can impersonate the server by completely
 bypassing the client's checks of the server's identity.
