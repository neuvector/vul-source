Description:
 A vulnerability was found in OpenSSH when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is
 enabled. A machine-in-the-middle attack can be performed by a malicious
 machine impersonating a legit server. This issue occurs due to how OpenSSH
 mishandles error codes in specific conditions when verifying the host key.
 For an attack to be considered successful, the attacker needs to manage to
 exhaust the client's memory resource first, turning the attack complexity
 high.
