Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. Prior to version 3.10.2, static routes which contain files with
 compressed variants (`.gz` or `.br` extension) are vulnerable to path
 traversal outside the root directory if those variants are symbolic links.
 The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root
 directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default).  It does this by
 resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that path
 relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when looking
 for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and symbolic links are
 then automatically followed when performing the `Path.stat()` and
 `Path.open()` to send the file. Version 3.10.2 contains a patch for the
 issue.
