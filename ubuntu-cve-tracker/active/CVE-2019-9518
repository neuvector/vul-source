Description:
 Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a flood of empty frames,
 potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of
 frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These
 frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer
 spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth.
 This can consume excess CPU.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that Netty incorrectly implements HTTP/2. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
