Description:
 An issue was discovered in QEMU through 5.1.0. An out-of-bounds memory
 access was found in the ATI VGA device implementation. This flaw occurs in
 the ati_2d_blt() routine in hw/display/ati_2d.c while handling MMIO write
 operations through the ati_mm_write() callback. A malicious guest could use
 this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
 service.
