Description:
 Middleware causes a prohibitive amount of heap allocations when processing
 malicious preflight requests that include a Access-Control-Request-Headers
 (ACRH) header whose value contains many commas. This behavior can be abused
 by attackers to produce undue load on the middleware/server as an attempt
 to cause a denial of service.
