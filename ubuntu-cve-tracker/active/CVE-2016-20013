Description:
 sha256crypt and sha512crypt through 0.6 allow attackers to cause a denial
 of service (CPU consumption) because the algorithm's runtime is
 proportional to the square of the length of the password.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> Actually addressing this will likely require every site that
   is using these password storage formats to make plans for an orderly
   transition to argon2 or scrypt or similar before making configuration
   changes. We may mark all of these packages as 'ignored' without any
   further work.
 rodrigo-zaiden> Despite the risks of applying any changes, there are no
   clues that glibc upstream will get this fixed. But just to make sure,
   before marking as ignored, I will mark as deferred as of 2022-06-01
   so we can revisit it in the future.
 mdeslaur> Marking this CVE as ignored as there is no way of fixing this.
