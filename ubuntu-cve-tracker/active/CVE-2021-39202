Description:
 WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in
 PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. In affected versions the
 widgets editor introduced in WordPress 5.8 beta 1 has improper handling of
 HTML input in the Custom HTML feature. This leads to stored XSS in the
 custom HTML widget. This has been patched in WordPress 5.8. It was only
 present during the testing/beta phase of WordPress 5.8.
