Description:
 race in VT-d domain ID cleanup Xen domain IDs are up to 15 bits wide. VT-d
 hardware may allow for only less than 15 bits to hold a domain ID
 associating a physical device with a particular domain. Therefore
 internally Xen domain IDs are mapped to the smaller value range. The
 cleaning up of the housekeeping structures has a race, allowing for VT-d
 domain IDs to be leaked and flushes to be bypassed.
