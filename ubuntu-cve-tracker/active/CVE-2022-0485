Description:
 A flaw was found in the copying tool `nbdcopy` of libnbd. When performing
 multi-threaded copies using asynchronous nbd calls, nbdcopy was blindly
 treating the completion of an asynchronous command as successful, rather
 than checking the *error parameter. This could result in the silent
 creation of a corrupted destination image.
