Description:
 When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL (ie "pip install
 hg+...") with pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision could be
 used to inject arbitrary configuration options to the "hg clone" call (ie
 "--config"). Controlling the Mercurial configuration can modify how and
 which repository is installed. This vulnerability does not affect users who
 aren't installing from Mercurial.
