Description:
 Newtonsoft.Json before version 13.0.1 is affected by a mishandling of
 exceptional conditions vulnerability. Crafted data that is passed to the
 JsonConvert.DeserializeObject method may trigger a StackOverflow exception
 resulting in denial of service. Depending on the usage of the library, an
 unauthenticated and remote attacker may be able to cause the denial of
 service condition.
