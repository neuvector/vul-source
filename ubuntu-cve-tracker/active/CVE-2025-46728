Description:
 cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library.
 Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size
 limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used
 or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send
 a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing
 uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential
 exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or
 unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during
 parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the
 connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a
 Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not
 feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the
 `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request
 body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they
 reach the vulnerable library code.
