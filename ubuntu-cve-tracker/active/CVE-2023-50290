Description:
 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in
 Apache Solr. The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment
 variables available to each Apache Solr instance. Users are able to specify
 which environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed
 to work for known secret Java system properties. Environment variables
 cannot be strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and
 may be set for the entire host, unlike Java system properties which are set
 per-Java-proccess. The Solr Metrics API is protected by the "metrics-read"
 permission. Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only be
 vulnerable via users with the "metrics-read" permission. This issue affects
 Apache Solr: from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to
 version 9.3.0 or later, in which environment variables are not published
 via the Metrics API.
