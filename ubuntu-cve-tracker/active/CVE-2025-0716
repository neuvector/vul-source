Description:
 Improper sanitization of the value of the 'href' and 'xlink:href'
 attributes in '<image>' SVG elements in AngularJS allows attackers to
 bypass common image source restrictions. This can lead to a form of
 Content Spoofing https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Content_Spoofing
 Â and also negatively affect the application's performance and behavior by
 using too large or slow-to-load images.
 
 This issue affects all versions of AngularJS.
 
 Note:
 The AngularJS project is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to
 address this issue. For more information see  here
