Description:
 Asterisk is an open-source private branch exchange (PBX). Prior to versions
 18.26.2, 20.14.1, 21.9.1, and 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14
 and 20.7-cert5 of certified-asterisk, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC
 3428) authentication do not get proper alignment. An authenticated attacker
 can spoof any user identity to send spam messages to the user with their

 trusted entities. Even administrators who follow Security best practices
 and Security Considerations can be impacted. Therefore, abuse can lead to
 spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. Versions
