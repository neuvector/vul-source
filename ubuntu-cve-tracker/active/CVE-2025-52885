Description:
 Poppler ia a library for rendering PDF files, and examining or modifying
 their structure. A use-after-free (write) vulnerability has been detected
 in versions Poppler prior to 25.10.0 within the StructTreeRoot class. The
 issue arises from the use of raw pointers to elements of a `std::vector`,
 which can lead to dangling pointers when the vector is resized. The
 vulnerability stems from the way that refToParentMap stores references to
 `std::vector` elements using raw pointers. These pointers may become
 invalid when the vector is resized. This vulnerability is a common security
 problem involving the use of raw pointers to `std::vectors`. Internally,
 `std::vector `stores its elements in a dynamically allocated array. When
 the array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, the vector
 reallocates a larger block of memory and moves all the existing elements to
 the new location. At this point if any pointers to elements are stored
 before a resize occurs, they become dangling pointers once the reallocation
 happens. Version 25.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.
