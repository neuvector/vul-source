Description:
 ModSecurity is an open source, cross platform web application firewall
 (WAF) engine for Apache, IIS and Nginx. In versions 2.9.11
 and below, an attacker can override the HTTP responseâ€™s Content-Type, which
 could lead to several issues depending on the HTTP scenario. For example,
 we have demonstrated the potential for XSS and arbitrary script source code
 disclosure in the latest version of mod_security2. This issue is fixed in
 version 2.9.12.
