Description:
 An issue was discovered in PostCSS before 8.4.31. The vulnerability affects
 linters using PostCSS to parse external untrusted CSS. An attacker can
 prepare CSS in such a way that it will contains parts parsed by PostCSS as
 a CSS comment. After processing by PostCSS, it will be included in the
 PostCSS output in CSS nodes (rules, properties) despite being included in a
 comment.
