Description:
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue
 was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause
 the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of
 their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with
 proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error
 page was displayed.
