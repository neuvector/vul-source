Description:
 Apache XmlGraphics Commons 2.4 and earlier is vulnerable to server-side
 request forgery, caused by improper input validation by the XMPParser. By
 using a specially-crafted argument, an attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability to cause the underlying server to make arbitrary GET
 requests. Users should upgrade to 2.6 or later.
