Description:
 An attacker can arbitrarily craft malicious DDS Participants (or ROS 2
 Nodes) with valid certificates to compromise and get full control of the
 attacked secure DDS databus system by exploiting vulnerable attributes in
 the configuration of PKCS#7 certificate’s validation. This is caused by a
 non-compliant implementation of permission document verification used by
 some DDS vendors. Specifically, an improper use of the OpenSSL PKCS7_verify
 function used to validate S/MIME signatures.
