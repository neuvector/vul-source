Description:
 Python 3.9.x before 3.9.16 and 3.10.x before 3.10.9 on Linux allows local
 privilege escalation in a non-default configuration. The Python
 multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on
 Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine
 local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user
 on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows
 for local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver process
 is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to
 False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is
 not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only
 Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make
 use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users
 manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in
 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls
 in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.
