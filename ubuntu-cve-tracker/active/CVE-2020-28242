Description:
 An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.37.1, 16.x
 before 16.14.1, 17.x before 17.8.1, and 18.x before 18.0.1 and Certified
 Asterisk before 16.8-cert5. If Asterisk is challenged on an outbound INVITE
 and the nonce is changed in each response, Asterisk will continually send
 INVITEs in a loop. This causes Asterisk to consume more and more memory
 since the transaction will never terminate (even if the call is hung up),
 ultimately leading to a restart or shutdown of Asterisk. Outbound
 authentication must be configured on the endpoint for this to occur.
