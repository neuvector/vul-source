Description:
 TrustedFirmware-M (aka Trusted Firmware for M profile Arm CPUs) before
 2.1.3 and 2.2.x before 2.2.1 lacks length validation during a firmware
 upgrade. While processing a new image, the Firmware Upgrade (FWU) module
 does not validate the length field of the Type-Length-Value (TLV) structure
 for dependent components against the maximum allowed size. If the length
 specified in the TLV exceeds the size of the buffer allocated on the stack,
 the FWU module will overwrite the buffer (and potentially other stack data)
 with the TLV's value content. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a
 malicious TLV entry in the unprotected section of the MCUBoot upgrade
 image. By setting the length field to exceed the expected structure size,
 the attacker can manipulate the stack memory of the system during the
 upgrade process.
