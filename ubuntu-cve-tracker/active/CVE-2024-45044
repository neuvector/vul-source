Description:
 Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data
 for operating systems. When a command ACL is in place and a user executes a
 command in bconsole using an abbreviation (i.e. "w" for "whoami") the ACL
 check did not apply to the full form (i.e. "whoami") but to the abbreviated
 form (i.e. "w"). If the command ACL is configured with negative ACL that
 should forbid using the "whoami" command, you could still use "w" or "who"
 as a command successfully. Fixes for the problem are shipped in Bareos
 versions 23.0.4, 22.1.6 and 21.1.11. If only positive command ACLs are used
 without any negation, the problem does not occur.
