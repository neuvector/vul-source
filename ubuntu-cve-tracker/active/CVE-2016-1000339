Description:
 In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the primary
 engine class used for AES was AESFastEngine. Due to the highly table driven
 approach used in the algorithm it turns out that if the data channel on the
 CPU can be monitored the lookup table accesses are sufficient to leak
 information on the AES key being used. There was also a leak in AESEngine
 although it was substantially less. AESEngine has been modified to remove
 any signs of leakage (testing carried out on Intel X86-64) and is now the
 primary AES class for the BC JCE provider from 1.56. Use of AESFastEngine
 is now only recommended where otherwise deemed appropriate.
