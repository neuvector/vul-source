Description:
 In GnuPG through 2.4.8, if a signed message has \f at the end of a
 plaintext line, an adversary can construct a modified message that places
 additional text after the signed material, such that signature verification
 of the modified message succeeds (although an "invalid armor" message is
 printed during verification). This is related to use of \f as a marker to
 denote truncation of a long plaintext line.
