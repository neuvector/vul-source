Description:
 Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the
 regular expression `block.def` may cause catastrophic backtracking against
 some strings and lead to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS).
 Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked
 and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is
 patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted
 markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a
 reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.
