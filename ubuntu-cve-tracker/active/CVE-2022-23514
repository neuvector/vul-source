Description:
 Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML
 documents and fragments, built on top of Nokogiri. Loofah < 2.19.1 contains
 an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive
 backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may
 lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue is
 patched in version 2.19.1.
