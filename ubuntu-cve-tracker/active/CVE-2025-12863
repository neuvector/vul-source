Description:
 A flaw was found in the xmlSetTreeDoc() function of the libxml2 XML parsing
 library. This function is responsible for updating document pointers when
 XML nodes are moved between documents. Due to improper handling of
 namespace references, a namespace pointer may remain linked to a freed
 memory region when the original document is destroyed. As a result,
 subsequent operations that access the namespace can lead to a
 use-after-free condition, causing an application crash.
