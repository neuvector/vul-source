Description:
 Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through
 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.
 
 
 
 
 Configurations are affected when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form
 of RewriteRule
  or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches
  some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then
  re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable
 substitution. For example, something like:
 
 
 
 
 RewriteEngine on
 RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]
 ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/
 
 
 Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in
 the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and
 cache poisoning. Users are recommended to update to at least version 2.4.56
 of Apache HTTP Server.
