Description:
 URL Restriction Bypass in GitHub repository plantuml/plantuml prior to
 V1.2022.5. An attacker can abuse this to bypass URL restrictions that are
 imposed by the different security profiles and achieve server side request
 forgery (SSRF). This allows accessing restricted internal resources/servers
 or sending requests to third party servers.
