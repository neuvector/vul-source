Description:
 GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. There
 is an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-40590. On Windows, GitPython uses an
 untrusted search path if it uses a shell to run `git`, as well as when it
 runs `bash.exe` to interpret hooks. If either of those features are used on
 Windows, a malicious `git.exe` or `bash.exe` may be run from an untrusted
 repository. This issue has been patched in version 3.1.41.
