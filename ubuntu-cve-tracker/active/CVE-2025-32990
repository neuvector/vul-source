Description:
 A heap-buffer-overflow (off-by-one) flaw was found in the GnuTLS software
 in the template parsing logic within the certtool utility. When it reads
 certain settings from a template file, it allows an attacker to cause an
 out-of-bounds (OOB) NULL pointer write, resulting in memory corruption and
 a denial-of-service (DoS) that could potentially crash the system.
