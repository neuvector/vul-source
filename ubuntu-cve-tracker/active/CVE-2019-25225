Description:
 `sanitize-html` prior to version 2.0.0-beta is vulnerable to Cross-site
 Scripting (XSS). The `sanitizeHtml()` function in `index.js` does not
 sanitize content when using the custom `transformTags` option, which is
 intended to convert attribute values into text. As a result, malicious
 input can be transformed into executable code.
