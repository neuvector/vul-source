Description:
 In Django 3.2 before 3.2.22, 4.1 before 4.1.12, and 4.2 before 4.2.6, the
 django.utils.text.Truncator chars() and words() methods (when used with
 html=True) are subject to a potential DoS (denial of service) attack via
 certain inputs with very long, potentially malformed HTML text. The chars()
 and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and
 truncatewords_html template filters, which are thus also vulnerable. NOTE:
 this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-14232.
