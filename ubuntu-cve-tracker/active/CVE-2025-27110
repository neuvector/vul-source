Description:
 Libmodsecurity is one component of the ModSecurity v3 project. The library
 codebase serves as an interface to ModSecurity Connectors taking in web
 traffic and applying traditional ModSecurity processing. A bug that exists
 only in Libmodsecurity3 version 3.0.13 means that, in 3.0.13,
 Libmodsecurity3 can't decode encoded HTML entities if they contains leading
 zeroes. Version 3.0.14 contains a fix. No known workarounds are available.
