Description:
 A flaw has been found in LibTIFF 4.7.0. This affects the function
 _TIFFmallocExt/_TIFFCheckRealloc/TIFFHashSetNew/InitCCITTFax3 of the file
 tools/tiffcmp.c of the component tiffcmp. Executing manipulation can lead
 to memory leak. The attack is restricted to local execution. This attack is
 characterized by high complexity. It is indicated that the exploitability
 is difficult. The exploit has been published and may be used. There is
 ongoing doubt regarding the real existence of this vulnerability. This
 patch is called ed141286a37f6e5ddafb5069347ff5d587e7a4e0. It is best
 practice to apply a patch to resolve this issue. A researcher disputes the
 security impact of this issue, because "this is a memory leak on a command
 line tool that is about to exit anyway". In the reply the project
 maintainer declares this issue as "a simple 'bug' when leaving the command
 line tool and (...) not a security issue at all".
