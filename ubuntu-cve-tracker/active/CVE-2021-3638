Description:
 An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the ATI VGA device
 emulation of QEMU. This flaw occurs in the ati_2d_blt() routine while
 handling MMIO write operations when the guest provides invalid values for
 the destination display parameters. A malicious guest could use this flaw
 to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.
