Description:
 A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists in
 curl <v7.88.0 that could cause HSTS functionality to behave incorrectly
 when multiple URLs are requested in parallel. Using its HSTS support, curl
 can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP
 step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would
 however surprisingly fail when multiple transfers are done in parallel as
 the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recentlycompleted
 transfer. A later HTTP-only transfer to the earlier host name would then
 *not* get upgraded properly to HSTS.
