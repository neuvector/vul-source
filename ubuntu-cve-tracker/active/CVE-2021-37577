Description:
 Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR Secure Connections pairing and Secure Simple
 Pairing using the Passkey entry protocol in Bluetooth Core Specifications
 2.1 through 5.3 may permit an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle attacker to
 identify the Passkey used during pairing by reflection of a crafted public
 key with the same X coordinate as the offered public key and by reflection
 of the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially
 permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the
 responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session. This
 is a related issue to CVE-2020-26558.
