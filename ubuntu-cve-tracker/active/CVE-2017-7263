Description:
 The bm_readbody_bmp function in bitmap_io.c in Potrace 1.14 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 BMP image. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2016-8698.
