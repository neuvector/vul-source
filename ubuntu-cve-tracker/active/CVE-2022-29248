Description:
 Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client. Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3
 contains a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is
 that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server
 which sets the cookie via the Set-Cookie header, allowing a malicious
 server to set cookies for unrelated domains. The cookie middleware is
 disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this
 issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler
 stack or construct the client with ['cookies' => true] are affected.
 Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple
 domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this
 vulnerability. Guzzle versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contain a patch for this
 issue. As a workaround, turn off the cookie middleware.
