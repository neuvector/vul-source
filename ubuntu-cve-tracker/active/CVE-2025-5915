Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in the libarchive library. This flaw
 can lead to a heap buffer over-read due to the size of a filter block
 potentially exceeding the Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Schieber (LZSS) window. This
 means the library may attempt to read beyond the allocated memory buffer,
 which can result in unpredictable program behavior, crashes (denial of
 service), or the disclosure of sensitive information from adjacent memory
 regions.
