Description:
 Mbed TLS before 3.6.4 allows a use-after-free in certain situations of
 applications that are developed in accordance with the documentation. The
 function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is
 documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that
 the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call
 mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep
 free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only
 on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory
 blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or
 double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and
 x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more
 than one DN).
