Description:
 ruby-saml provides security assertion markup language (SAML) single sign-on
 (SSO) for Ruby. An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in
 ruby-saml prior to versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 due to a parser differential.
 ReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently, the parsers can generate entirely
 different document structures from the same XML input. That allows an
 attacker to be able to execute a Signature Wrapping attack. This issue may
 lead to authentication bypass. Versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 contain a patch
 for the issue.

Notes:
  juliaphoebe> The backport involves introducing infrastructure for the 
    idp_multi_cert mechanism, which touches enough files that the backport
    is unnecessarily risky.
