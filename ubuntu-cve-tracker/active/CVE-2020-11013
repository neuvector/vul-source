Description:
 Their is an information disclosure vulnerability in Helm from version 3.1.0
 and before version 3.2.0. `lookup` is a Helm template function introduced
 in Helm v3. It is able to lookup resources in the cluster to check for the
 existence of specific resources and get details about them. This can be
 used as part of the process to render templates. The documented behavior of
 `helm template` states that it does not attach to a remote cluster.
 However, a the recently added `lookup` template function circumvents this
 restriction and connects to the cluster even during `helm template` and
 `helm install|update|delete|rollback --dry-run`. The user is not notified
 of this behavior. Running `helm template` should not make calls to a
 cluster. This is different from `install`, which is presumed to have access
 to a cluster in order to load resources into Kubernetes. Helm 2 is
 unaffected by this vulnerability. A malicious chart author could inject a
 `lookup` into a chart that, when rendered through `helm template`, performs
 unannounced lookups against the cluster a user&#39;s `KUBECONFIG` file
 points to. This information can then be disclosed via the output of `helm
 template`. This issue has been fixed in Helm 3.2.0
