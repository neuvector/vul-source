Description:
 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored in
 an LDAP directory. LAM's log configuration allows to specify arbitrary
 paths for log files. Prior to version 8.7, an attacker could exploit this
 by creating a PHP file and cause LAM to log some PHP code to this file.
 When the file is then accessed via web the code would be executed. The
 issue is mitigated by the following: An attacker needs to know LAM's master
 configuration password to be able to change the main settings; and the
 webserver needs write access to a directory that is accessible via web. LAM
 itself does not provide any such directories. The issue has been fixed in
 8.7. As a workaround, limit access to LAM configuration pages to authorized
 users.
