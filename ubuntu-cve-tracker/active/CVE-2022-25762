Description:
 If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the
 WebSocket connection closing when running on Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.75
 or Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20, it is possible that the application
 will continue to use the socket after it has been closed. The error
 handling triggered in this case could cause the a pooled object to be
 placed in the pool twice. This could result in subsequent connections using
 the same object concurrently which could result in data being returned to
 the wrong use and/or other errors.
