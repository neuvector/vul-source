Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
 Affected versions of Grafana expose multiple API endpoints which do not
 properly handle user authorization. `/teams/:teamId` will allow an
 authenticated attacker to view unintended data by querying for the specific
 team ID, `/teams/:search` will allow an authenticated attacker to search
 for teams and see the total number of available teams, including for those
 teams that the user does not have access to, and `/teams/:teamId/members`
 when editors_can_admin flag is enabled, an authenticated attacker can see
 unintended data by querying for the specific team ID. Users are advised to
 upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
