Description:
 A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43. It has been declared as
 problematic. This vulnerability affects the function bfd_malloc of the file
 libbfd.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The
 attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather
 high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been
 disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch
 to fix this issue. The code maintainer explains: "I'm not going to commit
 some of the leak fixes I've been working on to the 2.44 branch due to
 concern that would destabilise ld. All of the reported leaks in this
 bugzilla have been fixed on binutils master."
