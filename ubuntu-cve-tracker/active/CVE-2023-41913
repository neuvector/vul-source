Description:
 Buffer Overflow When Handling DH Public Values
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> After the USN was published, it was discovered that the Ubuntu
 mdeslaur> packages aren't built with --enable-tkm, so the vulnerable code
 mdeslaur> isn't built at all. If this is enabled in the future, the
 mdeslaur> jammy and earlier patches (inlcuding esm) need to be fixed to use
 mdeslaur> diffie_hellman_verify_value() instead of
 mdeslaur> key_exchange_verify_pubkey() for those older versions.
 mdeslaur> Marking remaining releases as "not-affected"
