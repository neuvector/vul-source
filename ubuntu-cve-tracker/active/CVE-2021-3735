Description:
 A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device of QEMU. It occurs
 on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while handling a host-to-device
 Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. A
 privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU
 process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The
 highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
