 https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.6.0
Description:
 pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version
 6.6.0, pypdf has possible long runtimes for missing /Root object with large
 /Size values. An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which
 leads to possibly long runtimes for actually invalid files. This can be
 achieved by omitting the /Root entry in the trailer, while using a rather
 large /Size value. Only the non-strict reading mode is affected. This issue
 has been patched in version 6.6.0.
