Description:
 In Yubico pam-u2f before 1.3.1, local privilege escalation can sometimes
 occur. This product implements a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) that
 can be deployed to support authentication using a YubiKey or other FIDO
 compliant authenticators on macOS or Linux. This software package has an
 issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An
 attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged
 user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know
 the user's password.
