Description:
 ESI plugin does not have the limit for maximum inclusion depth, and that
 allows excessive memory consumption if malicious instructions are inserted.
 
 Users can use a new setting for the plugin (--max-inclusion-depth) to limit
 it.
 This issue affects Apache Traffic Server: from 10.0.0 through 10.0.5, from
 9.0.0 through 9.2.10.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.2.11 or 10.0.6,  which fixes
 the issue.
