Description:
 Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation. In Nanopb
 before versions 0.4.4 and 0.3.9.7, decoding specifically formed message can
 leak memory if dynamic allocation is enabled and an oneof field contains a
 static submessage that contains a dynamic field, and the message being
 decoded contains the submessage multiple times. This is rare in normal
 messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed. This is fixed
 in versions 0.3.9.7 and 0.4.4. The following workarounds are available: 1)
 Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof field. This will generate fields
 as separate instead of C union, and avoids triggering the problematic code.
 2) Set the type of the submessage field inside oneof to `FT_POINTER`. This
 way the whole submessage will be dynamically allocated and the problematic
 code is not executed. 3) Use an arena allocator for nanopb, to make sure
 all memory can be released afterwards.
