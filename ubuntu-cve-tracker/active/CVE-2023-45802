Description:
 When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time
 window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately.
 Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could
 send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and
 causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all
 resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before
 that. This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487
 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal"
 HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory
 would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> backporting this to jammy and earlier will likely require
 mdeslaur> backporting the whole 2.0.10 version of the http/2 module as
 mdeslaur> it refactors how connections and streams are handled:
