Description:
 Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. Prior
 to versions 4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final, Netty is vulnerable to
 MadeYouReset DDoS. This is a logical vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol,
 that uses malformed HTTP/2 control frames in order to break the max
 concurrent streams limit - which results in resource exhaustion and
 distributed denial of service. This issue has been patched in versions
 4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final.
