Description:
 xz is a pure golang package for reading and writing xz-compressed files.
 Prior to version 0.5.14, it is possible to put data in front of an
 LZMA-encoded byte stream without detecting the situation while reading the
 header. This can lead to increased memory consumption because the current
 implementation allocates the full decoding buffer directly after reading
 the header. The LZMA header doesn't include a magic number or has a
 checksum to detect such an issue according to the specification. Note that
 the code recognizes the issue later while reading the stream, but at this
 time the memory allocation has already been done. This issue has been
 patched in version 0.5.14.
