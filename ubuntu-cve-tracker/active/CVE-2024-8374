Description:
 UltiMaker Cura slicer versions 5.7.0-beta.1 through 5.7.2 are vulnerable to
 code injection via the 3MF format reader (/plugins/ThreeMFReader.py). The
 vulnerability arises from improper handling of the drop_to_buildplate
 property within 3MF files, which are ZIP archives containing the model
 data. When a 3MF file is loaded in Cura, the value of the
 drop_to_buildplate property is passed to the Python eval() function without
 proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by
 crafting a malicious 3MF file. This vulnerability poses a significant risk
 as 3MF files are commonly shared via 3D model databases.
