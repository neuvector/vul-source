Description:
 Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and
 Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.
 
 The HttpURI class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of
 a URI.  However the behaviour of HttpURI
  differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be
 considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically
 HttpURI
  and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an
 invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may
  be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI
 is used after passing validation checks.
