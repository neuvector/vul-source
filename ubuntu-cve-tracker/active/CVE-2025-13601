Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow problem was found in glib through an incorrect
 calculation of buffer size in the g_escape_uri_string() function. If the
 string to escape contains a very large number of unacceptable characters
 (which would need escaping), the calculation of the length of the escaped
 string could overflow, leading to a potential write off the end of the
 newly allocated string.
