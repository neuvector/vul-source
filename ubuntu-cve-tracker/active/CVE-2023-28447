Description:
 Smarty is a template engine for PHP. In affected versions smarty did not
 properly escape javascript code. An attacker could exploit this
 vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the
 user's browser session. This may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
 user data, manipulation of the web application's behavior, or unauthorized
 actions performed on behalf of the user. Users are advised to upgrade to
 either version 3.1.48 or to 4.3.1 to resolve this issue. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> postfixadmin does not contain embedded copies of smarty in trusty and
 ccdm94> xenial. In bionic, postfixadmin contains an embedded smarty copy at
 ccdm94> version 3.1.29, while in jammy it contains an embedded copy at version
 ccdm94> 3.1.33. In lunar and mantic this copy is at version 4.3.0.
