Description:
 The Node.js Permission Model does not clarify in the documentation that
 wildcards should be only used as the last character of a file path. For
 example: ``` --allow-fs-read=/home/node/.ssh/*.pub ``` will ignore `pub`
 and give access to everything after `.ssh/`. This misleading documentation
 affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and
 Node.js 21. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the
 permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.
