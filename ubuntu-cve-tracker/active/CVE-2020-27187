Description:
 An issue was discovered in KDE Partition Manager 4.1.0 before 4.2.0. The
 kpmcore_externalcommand helper contains a logic flaw in which the service
 invoking D-Bus is not properly checked. An attacker on the local machine
 can replace /etc/fstab, and execute mount and other partitioning related
 commands, while KDE Partition Manager is running. the mount command can
 then be used to gain full root privileges.
