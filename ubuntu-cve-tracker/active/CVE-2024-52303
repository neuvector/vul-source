Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memory
 leak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by
 adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each
 MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to
 exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number
 (100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with
 aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.
