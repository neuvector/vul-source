Description:
 An issue was discovered in matio 1.5.28. A heap-based memory corruption can
 occur in Mat_VarCreateStruct() when the nfields value does not match the
 actual number of strings in the fields array. This leads to out-of-bounds
 reads and invalid memory frees during cleanup, potentially causing a
 segmentation fault or heap corruption.
