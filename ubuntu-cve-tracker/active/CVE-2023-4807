Description:
 Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code)
 implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of
 applications on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64
 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. Impact summary: If in
 an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker can influence
 whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be
 corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC
 (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save the
 contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when
 calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the
 caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their
 previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64
 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. The consequences of
 this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no
 consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of
 non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the
 attacker could get complete control of the application process. However
 given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so the attacker
 cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence, if any,
 would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or
 a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most
 frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated
 encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this
 AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious
 client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used by the server. This
 implies that server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted.
 However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would
 be affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity
 security issue. As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be
 disabled at runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap:
 OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000 The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.
