Description:
 NuProcess is an external process execution implementation for Java. In all
 the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's
 Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+), attackers can use
 NUL characters in their strings to perform command line injection. Java's
 ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start.
 NuProcess is missing that check. This vulnerability can only be exploited
 to inject command line arguments on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch.
 As a workaround, users of the library can sanitize command strings to
 remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution.
