Description:
 An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS 1.3 client
 connects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on its session, the
 server crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs in the second
 session, which is created through TLS session resumption and reuses the
 initial struct WOLFSSL. If the server reuses the previous session structure
 (struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL* ssl) on it, the next
 received Client Hello (that resumes the previous session) crashes the
 server. Note that this bug is only triggered when resuming sessions using
 TLS session resumption. Only servers that use wolfSSL_clear instead of the
 recommended SSL_free; SSL_new sequence are affected. Furthermore,
 wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's compatibility layer and is not enabled
 by default. It is not part of wolfSSL's native API.
