Description:
 Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete
 and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds read
 was found in Exiv2 versions 0.28.5 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is
 triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.
 An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial
 of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running
 Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when
 writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than
 reading the metadata. The bug is fixed in version 0.28.6.
