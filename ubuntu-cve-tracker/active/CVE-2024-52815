Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse versions before
 1.120.1 fail to properly validate invites received over federation. This
 vulnerability allows a malicious server to send a specially crafted invite
 that disrupts the invited user's /sync functionality. Synapse 1.120.1
 rejects such invalid invites received over federation and restores the
 ability to sync for affected users.
