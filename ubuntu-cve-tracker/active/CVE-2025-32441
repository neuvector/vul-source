Description:
 Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.14, when
 using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can
 restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to
 occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the
 beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes
 applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a
 subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests.
 When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker
 can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be
 restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that
 same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit
 access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a
 patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure
 the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged
 out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check
 this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session
 store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept
 session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.
