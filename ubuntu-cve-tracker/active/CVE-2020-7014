Description:
 The fix for CVE-2020-7009 was found to be incomplete. Elasticsearch
 versions from 6.7.0 to 6.8.7 and 7.0.0 to 7.6.1 contain a privilege
 escalation flaw if an attacker is able to create API keys and also
 authentication tokens. An attacker who is able to generate an API key and
 an authentication token can perform a series of steps that result in an
 authentication token being generated with elevated privileges.
