 https://github.com/ros/actionlib/pull/171
Description:
 Use of unsafe yaml load. Allows instantiation of arbitrary objects. The
 flaw itself is caused by an unsafe parsing of YAML values which happens
 whenever an action message is processed to be sent, and allows for the
 creation of Python objects. Through this flaw in the ROS core package of
 actionlib, an attacker with local or remote access can make the ROS Master,
 execute arbitrary code in Python form. Consider yaml.safe_load() instead.
 Located first in actionlib/tools/library.py:132. See links for more info on
