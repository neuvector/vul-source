Description:
 Scala 2.13.x before 2.13.9 has a Java deserialization chain in its JAR
 file. On its own, it cannot be exploited. There is only a risk in
 conjunction with Java object deserialization within an application. In such
 situations, it allows attackers to erase contents of arbitrary files, make
 network connections, or possibly run arbitrary code (specifically,
 Function0 functions) via a gadget chain.
