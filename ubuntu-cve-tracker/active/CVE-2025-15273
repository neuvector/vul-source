Description:
 FontForge PFB File Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code
 Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code on affected installations of FontForge. User
 interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
 must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PFB files. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data
 prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can
 leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
 user. Was ZDI-CAN-28546.
