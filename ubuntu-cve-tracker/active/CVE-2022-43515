 https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBXSEC-125
Description:
 Zabbix Frontend provides a feature that allows admins to maintain the
 installation and ensure that only certain IP addresses can access it. In
 this way, any user will not be able to access the Zabbix Frontend while it
 is being maintained and possible sensitive data will be prevented from
 being disclosed. An attacker can bypass this protection and access the
 instance using IP address not listed in the defined range.
