Description:
 iPerf3 before 3.17, when used with OpenSSL before 3.2.0 as a server with
 RSA authentication, allows a timing side channel in RSA decryption
 operations. This side channel could be sufficient for an attacker to
 recover credential plaintext. It requires the attacker to send a large
 number of messages for decryption, as described in "Everlasting ROBOT: the
 Marvin Attack" by Hubert Kario.
