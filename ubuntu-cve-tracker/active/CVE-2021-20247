Description:
 A flaw was found in mbsync before v1.3.5 and v1.4.1. Validations of the
 mailbox names returned by IMAP LIST/LSUB do not occur allowing a malicious
 or compromised server to use specially crafted mailbox names containing
 '..' path components to access data outside the designated mailbox on the
 opposite end of the synchronization channel. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.
