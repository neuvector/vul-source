Description:
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
 System and Network Security Monitoring engine. The AF_PACKET defrag option
 is enabled by default and allows AF_PACKET to re-assemble fragmented
 packets before reaching Suricata. However the default packet size in
 Suricata is based on the network interface MTU which leads to Suricata
 seeing truncated packets. Upgrade to Suricata 7.0.9, which uses better
 defaults and adds warnings for user configurations that may lead to issues.
