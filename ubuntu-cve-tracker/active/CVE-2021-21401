Description:
 Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in ansi C. In
 Nanopb before versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5, decoding a specifically formed
 message can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the message type
 contains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly contains both a pointer
 field and a non-pointer field. If the message data first contains the
 non-pointer field and then the pointer field, the data of the non-pointer
 field is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer value. Such message
 data rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted
 data is parsed. This has been fixed in versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5. See
 referenced GitHub Security Advisory for more information including
 workarounds.
