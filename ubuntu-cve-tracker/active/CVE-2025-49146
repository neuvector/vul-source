Description:
 pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. From 42.7.4 and until
 42.7.7, when the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is configured with channel binding
 set to required (default value is prefer), the driver would incorrectly
 allow connections to proceed with authentication methods that do not
 support channel binding (such as password, MD5, GSS, or SSPI
 authentication). This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept
 connections that users believed were protected by channel binding
 requirements. This vulnerability is fixed in 42.7.7.
