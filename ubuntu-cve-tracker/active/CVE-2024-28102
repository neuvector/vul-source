Description:
 JWCrypto implements JWK, JWS, and JWE specifications using
 python-cryptography. Prior to version 1.5.6, an attacker can cause a denial
 of service attack by passing in a malicious JWE Token with a high
 compression ratio. When the server processes this token, it will consume a
 lot of memory and processing time. Version 1.5.6 fixes this vulnerability
 by limiting the maximum token length.
