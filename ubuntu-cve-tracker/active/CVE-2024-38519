Description:
 `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` are command-line audio/video downloaders. Prior
 to the fixed versions,Â `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` do not limit the
 extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames
 being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since
 `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` also read config from the working directory (and
 on Windows executables will be executed from the `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl`
 directory), this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.
 
 
 
 
 `yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed
 extensions. `youtube-dl` fixes this issue in commit `d42a222` on the
 `master` branch and in nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later. This
 might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however
 it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to
 upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure
 the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make
 sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive
 locations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binaries
 locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output
 template (`-o "%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of the
 media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid the
 generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to
 not load config from common locations.
