Description:
 This affects the package latte/latte before 2.10.6. There is a way to
 bypass allowFunctions that will affect the security of the application.
 When the template is set to allow/disallow the use of certain functions,
 adding control characters (x00-x08) after the function will bypass these
 restrictions.
