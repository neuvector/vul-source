Description:
 A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the CacheCleaner component of
 Robocode version 1.9.3.6. The recursivelyDelete method fails to properly
 sanitize file paths, allowing attackers to traverse directories and delete
 arbitrary files on the system. This vulnerability can be exploited by
 submitting specially crafted inputs that manipulate the file path, leading
 to potential unauthorized file deletions.  https://robo-code.blogspot.com/
