Description:
 Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit.
 Prior to versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2, if a SIP request is
 received with an Authorization header that contains a realm that wasn't in
 a previous 401 response's WWW-Authenticate header, or an Authorization
 header with an incorrect realm was received without a previous 401 response
 being sent, the get_authorization_header() function in
 res_pjsip_authenticator_digest will return a NULL. This wasn't being
 checked before attempting to get the digest algorithm from the header which
 causes a SEGV. This issue has been patched in versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2,
 and 22.5.2. There are no workarounds.
