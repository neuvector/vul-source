Description:
 Spotipy is a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. The
 `CacheHandler` class creates a cache file to store the auth token. Prior to
 version 2.25.1, the file created has `rw-r--r--` (644) permissions by
 default, when it could be locked down to `rw-------` (600) permissions.
 This leads to overly broad exposure of the spotify auth token. If this
 token can be read by an attacker (another user on the machine, or a process
 running as another user), it can be used to perform administrative actions
 on the Spotify account, depending on the scope granted to the token.
 Version 2.25.1 tightens the cache file permissions.
