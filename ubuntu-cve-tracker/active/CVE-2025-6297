Description:
 It was discovered that dpkg-deb does not properly sanitize directory
 permissions when extracting a control member into a temporary directory,
 which is
 documented as being a safe operation even on untrusted data. This may
 result in leaving temporary files behind on cleanup. Given automated and
 repeated execution of dpkg-deb commands on
 adversarial .deb packages or with well compressible files, placed
 inside a directory with permissions not allowing removal by a non-root
 user, this can end up in a DoS scenario due to causing disk quota
 exhaustion or disk full conditions.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This issue only results in temporary files being left behind
 mdeslaur> when manually extracting deb packages with the dpkg-deb tool.
 mdeslaur> Contrary to the CVSS score, this is a rather unimportant issue.
 mdeslaur> Marking as low priority.
