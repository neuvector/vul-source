Description:
 A flaw was found in the FreeIPA API audit, where it sends the whole FreeIPA
 command line to journalctl. As a consequence, during the FreeIPA
 installation process, it inadvertently leaks the administrative user
 credentials, including the administrator password, to the journal database.
 In the worst-case scenario, where the journal log is centralized, users
 with access to it can have improper access to the FreeIPA administrator
 credentials.
