Description:
 A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RGW in versions before

 The greatest threat to the system is of availability.

 not properly handle GET requests for swift URLs in some situations,
 leading to an application crash. An attacker could use this to cause
 a denial of service.
