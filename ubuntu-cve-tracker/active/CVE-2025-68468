Description:
 Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network
 via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In 0.9-rc2 and earlier, avahi-daemon
 can be crashed by sending unsolicited announcements containing CNAME
 resource records pointing it to resource records with short TTLs. As soon
 as they expire avahi-daemon crashes.
