Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. With a crafted username or a table
 name, it was possible to inject SQL statements in the tracking
 functionality that would run with the privileges of the control user. This
 gives read and write access to the tables of the configuration storage
 database, and if the control user has the necessary privileges, read access
 to some tables of the MySQL database. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5),
 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18)
 are affected.
