Description:
 Recent x86 CPUs offer functionality named Control-flow Enforcement
 Technology (CET). A sub-feature of this are Shadow Stacks (CET-SS). CET-SS
 is a hardware feature designed to protect against Return Oriented
 Programming attacks. When enabled, traditional stacks holding both data and
 return addresses are accompanied by so called "shadow stacks", holding
 little more than return addresses. Shadow stacks aren't writable by normal
 instructions, and upon function returns their contents are used to check
 for possible manipulation of a return address coming from the traditional
 stack. In particular certain memory accesses need intercepting by Xen. In
 various cases the necessary emulation involves kind of replaying of the
 instruction. Such replaying typically involves filling and then invoking of
 a stub. Such a replayed instruction may raise an exceptions, which is
 expected and dealt with accordingly. Unfortunately the interaction of both
 of the above wasn't right: Recovery involves removal of a call frame from
 the (traditional) stack. The counterpart of this operation for the shadow
 stack was missing.
