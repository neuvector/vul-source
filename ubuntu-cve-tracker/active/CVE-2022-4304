Description:
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption
 implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a
 network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
 decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of
 trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding
 modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection,
 RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to
 the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a
 client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the
 server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently
 large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret
 used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
 application data sent over that connection.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> Due to the substantial code changes required to fix this side
 mdeslaur> channel issue and others like it in the 1.0.2 and earlier
 mdeslaur> codebases, we will not be fixing this issue in bionic and
 mdeslaur> earlier to not introduce possible regressions.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The commit was later reverted, and a more simplified fix was
 mdeslaur> used, see:
