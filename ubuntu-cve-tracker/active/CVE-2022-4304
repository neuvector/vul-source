Description:
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption
 implementation
 which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
 Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker
 would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for
 decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,
 RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.
 
 For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send
 an
 encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
 genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to
 send
 trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them.
 After a
 sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the
 pre-master
 secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
 application data sent over that connection.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> Due to the substantial code changes required to fix this side
 mdeslaur> channel issue and others like it in the 1.0.2 and earlier
 mdeslaur> codebases, we will not be fixing this issue in bionic and
 mdeslaur> earlier to not introduce possible regressions.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The commit was later reverted, and a more simplified fix was
 mdeslaur> used, see:
