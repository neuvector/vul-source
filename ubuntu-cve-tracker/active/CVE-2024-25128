Description:
 Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of
 Flask. When Flask-AppBuilder is set to AUTH_TYPE AUTH_OID, it allows an
 attacker to forge an HTTP request, that could deceive the backend into
 using any requested OpenID service. This vulnerability could grant an
 attacker unauthorised privilege access if a custom OpenID service is
 deployed by the attacker and accessible by the backend. This vulnerability
 is only exploitable when the application is using the OpenID 2.0
 authorization protocol. Upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 4.3.11 to fix the
 vulnerability.
