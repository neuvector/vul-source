Description:
 In qutebrowser versions less than 1.11.1, reloading a page with certificate
 errors shows a green URL. After a certificate error was overridden by the
 user, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow
 (colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However, when the affected website was
 subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green
 (colors.statusbar.url.success_https). While the user already has seen a
 certificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl_strict to false,
 which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of
 security. This has been fixed in 1.11.1 and 1.12.0. All versions of
 qutebrowser are believed to be affected, though versions before v0.11.x
 couldn't be tested. Backported patches for older versions (greater than or
 equal to 1.4.0 and less than or equal to 1.10.2) are available, but no
 further releases are planned.
