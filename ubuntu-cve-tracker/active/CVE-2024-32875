Description:
 Hugo is a static site generator. Starting in version 0.123.0 and prior to
 version 0.125.3, title arguments in Markdown for links and images not
 escaped in internal render hooks. Hugo users who are impacted are those who
 have these hooks enabled and do not trust their Markdown content files. The
 issue is patched in v0.125.3. As a workaround, replace the templates with
 user defined templates or disable the internal templates.
