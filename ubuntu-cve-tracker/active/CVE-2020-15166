Description:
 In ZeroMQ before version 4.3.3, there is a denial-of-service vulnerability.
 Users with TCP transport public endpoints, even with CURVE/ZAP enabled, are
 impacted. If a raw TCP socket is opened and connected to an endpoint that
 is fully configured with CURVE/ZAP, legitimate clients will not be able to
 exchange any message. Handshakes complete successfully, and messages are
 delivered to the library, but the server application never receives them.
 This is patched in version 4.3.3.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that ZeroMQ mishandled certain network traffic. An
 unauthenticated attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a
 denial-of-service and prevent legitimate clients from communicating with
 ZeroMQ.
