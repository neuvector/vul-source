Description:
 A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind
 2.0.0 through 2.9.10. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or
 for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the
 service has the apache-log4j-extra (version 1.2.x) jar in the classpath,
 and an attacker can provide a JNDI service to access, it is possible to
 make the service execute a malicious payload.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled 
 deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
 arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.
