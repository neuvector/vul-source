Description:
 WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in
 PHP and paired with a MariaDB database. On a multisite, users with Super
 Admin role can bypass explicit/additional hardening under certain
 conditions through object injection. This has been patched in WordPress
 version 5.8.3. Older affected versions are also fixed via security release,
 that go back till 3.7.37. We strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates
 enabled. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
