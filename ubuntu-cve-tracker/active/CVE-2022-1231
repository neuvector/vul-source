Description:
 XSS via Embedded SVG in SVG Diagram Format in GitHub repository
 plantuml/plantuml prior to 1.2022.4. Stored XSS in the context of the
 diagram embedder. Depending on the actual context, this ranges from
 stealing secrets to account hijacking or even to code execution for example
 in desktop applications. Web based applications are the ones most affected.
 Since the SVG format allows clickable links in diagrams, it is commonly
 used in plugins for web based projects (like the Confluence plugin, etc.
 see https://plantuml.com/de/running).
