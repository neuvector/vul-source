Description:
 A flaw was found in ansible. Credentials, such as secrets, are being
 disclosed in console log by default and not protected by no_log feature
 when using those modules. An attacker can take advantage of this
 information to steal those credentials. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality. Versions before ansible 2.9.18
 are affected.
