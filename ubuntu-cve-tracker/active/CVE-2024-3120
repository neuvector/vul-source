Description:
 A stack-buffer overflow vulnerability exists in all versions of sngrep
 since v1.4.1. The flaw is due to inadequate bounds checking when copying
 'Content-Length' and 'Warning' headers into fixed-size buffers in the
 sip_validate_packet and sip_parse_extra_headers functions within src/sip.c.
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
 cause a denial of service (DoS) via crafted SIP messages.
