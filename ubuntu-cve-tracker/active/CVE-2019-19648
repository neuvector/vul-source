Description:
 In the macho_parse_file functionality in macho/macho.c of YARA 3.11.0,
 command_size may be inconsistent with the real size. A specially crafted
 MachO file can cause an out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in Denial of
 Service (application crash) or potential code execution.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray| Whilst the description claims code-execution, this is only an
  out-of-bounds read so just a denial of service.
