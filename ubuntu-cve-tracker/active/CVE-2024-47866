Description:
 Ceph is a distributed object, block, and file storage platform. In versions
 up to and including 19.2.3, using the argument `x-amz-copy-source` to put
 an object and specifying an empty string as its content leads to the RGW
 daemon crashing, resulting in a DoS attack. As of time of publication, no
 known patched versions exist.
