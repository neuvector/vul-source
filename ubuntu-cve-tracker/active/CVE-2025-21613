Description:
 go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure
 Go. An argument injection vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions
 prior to v5.13. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow
 an attacker to set arbitrary values to git-upload-pack flags. This only
 happens when the file transport protocol is being used, as that is the only
 protocol that shells out to git binaries. This vulnerability is fixed in
 5.13.0.
