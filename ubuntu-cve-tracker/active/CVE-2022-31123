Description:
 Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization platform.
 Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 are vulnerable to a bypass in the plugin
 signature verification. An attacker can convince a server admin to download
 and successfully run a malicious plugin even though unsigned plugins are
 not allowed. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a
 workaround, do not install plugins downloaded from untrusted sources.
