Description:
 x86 shadow paging arbitrary pointer dereference In environments where host
 assisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging
 (HAP) is unavailable, Xen will run guests in so called shadow mode. Due to
 too lax a check in one of the hypervisor routines used for shadow page
 handling it is possible for a guest with a PCI device passed through to
 cause the hypervisor to access an arbitrary pointer partially under guest
 control.
