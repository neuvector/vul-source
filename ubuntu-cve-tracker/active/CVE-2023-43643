Description:
 AntiSamy is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML
 coming from untrusted sources. Prior to version 1.7.4, there is a potential
 for a mutation XSS (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed
 parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability
 the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file and
 also allow for certain tags at the same time. As a result, certain crafty
 inputs can result in elements in comment tags being interpreted as
 executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized output. This issue has been
 patched in AntiSamy 1.7.4 and later.
