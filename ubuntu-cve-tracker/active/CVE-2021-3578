Description:
 A flaw was found in mbsync before v1.3.6 and v1.4.2, where an unchecked
 pointer cast allows a malicious or compromised server to write an arbitrary
 integer value past the end of a heap-allocated structure by issuing an
 unexpected APPENDUID response. This could be plausibly exploited for remote
 code execution on the client.
