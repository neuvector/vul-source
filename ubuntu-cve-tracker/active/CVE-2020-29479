Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. In the Ocaml xenstored
 implementation, the internal representation of the tree has special cases
 for the root node, because this node has no parent. Unfortunately,
 permissions were not checked for certain operations on the root node.
 Unprivileged guests can get and modify permissions, list, and delete the
 root node. (Deleting the whole xenstore tree is a host-wide denial of
 service.) Achieving xenstore write access is also possible. All systems
 using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the
 default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is
 available. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable.
