Description:
 In Miller (command line utility) using the configuration file support
 introduced in version 5.9.0, it is possible for an attacker to cause Miller
 to run arbitrary code by placing a malicious `.mlrrc` file in the working
 directory. See linked GitHub Security Advisory for complete details. A fix
 is ready and will be released as Miller 5.9.1.
