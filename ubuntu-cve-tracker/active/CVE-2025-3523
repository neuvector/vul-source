Description:
 When an email contains multiple attachments with external links via the
 X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header, only the last link is shown when
 hovering over any attachment. Although the correct link is used on click,
 the misleading hover text could trick users into downloading content from
 untrusted sources. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 137.0.2 and
 Thunderbird < 128.9.2.
