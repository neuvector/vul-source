Description:
 A Use-After-Free vulnerability has been discovered in GRUB's gettext
 module. This flaw stems from a programming error where the gettext command
 remains registered in memory after its module is unloaded. An attacker can
 exploit this condition by invoking the orphaned command, causing the
 application to access a memory location that is no longer valid. An
 attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause grub to crash, leading
 to a Denial of Service. Possible data integrity or confidentiality
 compromise is not discarded.

Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
