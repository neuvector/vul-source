Description:
 Hugo is a static site generator. Starting in version 0.123.0 and prior to
 version 0.139.4, some HTML attributes in Markdown in the internal templates
 listed below not escaped in internal render hooks. Those whoa re impacted
 are Hugo users who do not trust their Markdown content files and are using
 one or more of these templates: `_default/_markup/render-link.html` from
 `v0.123.0`; `_default/_markup/render-image.html` from `v0.123.0`;
 `_default/_markup/render-table.html` from `v0.134.0`; and/or
 `shortcodes/youtube.html` from `v0.125.0`. This issue is patched in
 v0.139.4. As a workaround, one may replace an affected component with user
 defined templates or disable the internal templates.
