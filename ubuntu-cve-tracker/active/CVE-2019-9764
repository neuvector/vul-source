Description:
 HashiCorp Consul 1.4.3 lacks server hostname verification for
 agent-to-agent TLS communication. In other words, the product behaves as if
 verify_server_hostname were set to false, even when it is actually set to
 true. This is fixed in 1.4.4.

Notes:
 alexmurray| Upstream says this only affects 1.4.3 and is fixed in 1.4.4 but it
  is not clear if earlier versions were affected or not so leaving as
  needs-triage for bionic with version 0.6.4~dfsg-3
