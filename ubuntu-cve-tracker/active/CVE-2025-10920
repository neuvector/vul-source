Description:
 GIMP ICNS File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of ICNS files. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can
 result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can
 leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
 process. Was ZDI-CAN-27684.
