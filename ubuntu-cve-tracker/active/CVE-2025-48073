Description:
 OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR
 file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In
 version 3.3.2, when reading a deep scanline image with a large sample count
 in reduceMemory mode, it is possible to crash a target application with a
 NULL pointer dereference in a write operation. This is fixed in version
 3.3.3.
