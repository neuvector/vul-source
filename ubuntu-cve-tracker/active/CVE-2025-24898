Description:
 rust-openssl is a set of OpenSSL bindings for the Rust programming
 language. In affected versions `ssl::select_next_proto` can return a slice
 pointing into the `server` argument's buffer but with a lifetime bound to
 the `client` argument. In situations where the `sever` buffer's lifetime is
 shorter than the `client` buffer's, this can cause a use after free. This
 could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to
 the client. The crate`openssl` version 0.10.70 fixes the signature of
 `ssl::select_next_proto` to properly constrain the output buffer's lifetime
 to that of both input buffers. Users are advised to upgrade. In standard
 usage of `ssl::select_next_proto` in the callback passed to
 `SslContextBuilder::set_alpn_select_callback`, code is only affected if the
 `server` buffer is constructed *within* the callback.
