Description:
 A flaw was found in nbdkit due to to improperly caching plaintext state
 across the STARTTLS encryption boundary. A MitM attacker could use this
 flaw to inject a plaintext NBD_OPT_STRUCTURED_REPLY before proxying
 everything else a client sends to the server, potentially leading the
 client to terminate the NBD session. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to system availability.
