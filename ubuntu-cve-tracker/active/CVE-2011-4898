Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in
 WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier generates different error messages for requests
 lacking a dbname parameter depending on whether the MySQL credentials are
 valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force
 attacks via a series of requests with different uname and pwd parameters.
 NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue; also, it is
 unclear whether providing intentionally vague error messages during
 installation would be reasonable from a usability perspective.
