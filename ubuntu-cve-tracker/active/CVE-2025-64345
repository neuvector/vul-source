Description:
 Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 38.0.4, 37.0.3,
 36.0.3, and 24.0.5, Wasmtime's Rust embedder API contains an unsound
 interaction where a WebAssembly shared linear memory could be viewed as a
 type which provides safe access to the host (Rust) to the contents of the
 linear memory. This is not sound for shared linear memories, which could be
 modified in parallel, and this could lead to a data race in the host. Patch
 releases have been issued for all supported versions of Wasmtime, notably:
 24.0.5, 36.0.3, 37.0.3, and 38.0.4. These releases reject creation of
 shared memories via `Memory::new` and shared memories are now excluded from
 core dumps. As a workaround, eembeddings affected by this issue should use
 `SharedMemory::new` instead of `Memory::new` to create shared memories.
 Affected embeddings should also disable core dumps if they are unable to
 upgrade. Note that core dumps are disabled by default but the wasm threads
 proposal (and shared memory) is enabled by default.
