Description:
 When a transaction is committed, C Xenstored will first check the quota is
 correct before attempting to commit any nodes. It would be possible that
 accounting is temporarily negative if a node has been removed outside of
 the transaction. Unfortunately, some versions of C Xenstored are assuming
 that the quota cannot be negative and are using assert() to confirm it.
 This will lead to C Xenstored crash when tools are built without -DNDEBUG
 (this is the default).
