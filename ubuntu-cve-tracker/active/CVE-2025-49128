Description:
 Jackson-core contains core low-level incremental ("streaming") parser and
 generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. Starting in version
 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.13.0, a flaw in jackson-core's
 `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of
 unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When
 parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception
 message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the
 logical payload start. This results in possible information disclosure in
 systems using pooled or reused buffers, like Netty or Vert.x. This issue
 was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September
 30, 2021, via PR #652. All users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later.
 If upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the
 issue by disabling exception message exposure to clients to avoid returning
 parsing exception messages in HTTP responses and/or disabling source
 inclusion in exceptions to prevent Jackson from embedding any source
 content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.
