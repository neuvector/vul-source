Description:
 slab is a pre-allocated storage for a uniform data type. In version 0.4.10,
 the get_disjoint_mut method incorrectly checked if indices were within the
 slab's capacity instead of its length, allowing access to uninitialized
 memory. This could lead to undefined behavior or potential crashes. This
 has been fixed in slab 0.4.11. A workaround for this issue involves to
 avoid using get_disjoint_mut with indices that might be beyond the slab's
 actual length.
