Description:
 While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to
 KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced. Two
 preconditions are needed to trigger the bug: 1. The administrator decides
 to remove an ACL 2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues
 to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal. When
 those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had
 only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or
 more that would be correct. The incorrect condition is cleared by removing
 all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource.
 Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all
 remain). The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs
 were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to
 availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include
 confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as
 the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the
 migration period.
