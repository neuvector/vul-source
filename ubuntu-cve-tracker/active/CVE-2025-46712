Description:
 Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. In
 versions prior to OTP-27.3.4 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.12 (for OTP-26), and
 OTP-25.3.2.21 (for OTP-25), Erlang/OTP SSH fails to enforce strict KEX
 handshake hardening measures by allowing optional messages to be exchanged.
 This allows a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to inject these messages in a
 connection during the handshake. This issue has been patched in versions
 OTP-27.3.4 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.12 (for OTP-26), and OTP-25.3.2.21 (for
 OTP-25).
