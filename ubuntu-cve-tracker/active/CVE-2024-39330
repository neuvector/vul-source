Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14.
 Derived classes of the django.core.files.storage.Storage base class, when
 they override generate_filename() without replicating the file-path
 validations from the parent class, potentially allow directory traversal
 via certain inputs during a save() call. (Built-in Storage sub-classes are
 unaffected.)
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> upstream advises that only versions 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1 (plus main
  development branch) are affected but it is likely earlier versions may
  also be affected but upstream do not mention this as they are no longer
  maintained by them
Mitigation:
Bugs:
Priority: low
 Does not affect any of the built-in classes
