Description:
 A flaw was found in systems utilizing LUKS-encrypted disks with GRUB
 configured for TPM-based auto-decryption. When GRUB is set to automatically
 decrypt disks using keys stored in the TPM, it reads the decryption key
 into system memory. If an attacker with physical access can corrupt the
 underlying filesystem superblock, GRUB will fail to locate a valid
 filesystem and enter rescue mode. At this point, the disk is already
 decrypted, and the decryption key remains loaded in system memory. This
 scenario may allow an attacker with physical access to access the
 unencrypted data without any further authentication, thereby compromising
 data confidentiality. Furthermore, the ability to force this state through
 filesystem corruption also presents a data integrity concern.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes grub2 and
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned should have same major version Ubuntu Secure Boot
 eslerm> and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel cannot handle new
 eslerm> versions of grub Note that key revocation is required to protect
 eslerm> against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
