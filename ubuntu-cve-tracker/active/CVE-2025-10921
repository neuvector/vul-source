Description:
 GIMP HDR File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the parsing of HDR files. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data
 prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
 vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was
 ZDI-CAN-27803.
