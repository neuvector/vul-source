Description:
 An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the write method of the Buffer
 class in Robocode version 1.9.3.6. The method fails to properly validate
 the length of data being written, allowing attackers to cause an overflow,
 potentially leading to buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution. This
 vulnerability can be exploited by submitting specially crafted inputs that
 manipulate the data length, leading to potential unauthorized code
 execution.
