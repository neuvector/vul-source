Description:
 Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify
 elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit
 encoding of the parameters. A bug in the parsing of name constraint
 extensions in X.509 certificates meant that if the extension included both
 permitted subtrees and excluded subtrees, only the permitted subtree would
 be checked. If a certificate included a name which was permitted by the
 permitted subtree but also excluded by excluded subtree, it would be
 accepted. Fixed in versions 3.5.0 and 2.19.5.
