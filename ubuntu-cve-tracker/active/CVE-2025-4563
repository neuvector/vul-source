Description:
 A vulnerability exists in the NodeRestriction admission controller where
 nodes can bypass dynamic resource allocation authorization checks. When the
 DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate is enabled, the controller properly
 validates resource claim statuses during pod status updates but fails to
 perform equivalent validation during pod creation. This allows a
 compromised node to create mirror pods that access unauthorized dynamic
 resources, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
