Description:
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the way the
 Snort detection engine processes ICMP traffic that could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
 condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
 memory resource management while the Snort detection engine is processing
 ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
 series of ICMP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit
 could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected device,
 causing the device to reload.
