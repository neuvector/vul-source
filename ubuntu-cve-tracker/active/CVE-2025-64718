Description:
 js-yaml is a JavaScript YAML parser and dumper. In js-yaml 4.1.0 and below,
 it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a
 parsed yaml document via prototype pollution (`__proto__`). All users who
 parse untrusted yaml documents may be impacted. The problem is patched in
 js-yaml 4.1.1. Users can protect against this kind of attack on the server
 by using `node --disable-proto=delete` or `deno` (in Deno, pollution
 protection is on by default).
