Description:
 A temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava,
 allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data
 in a temporary directory created by the Guava API
 com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like
 systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker
 with access to the system). The method in question has been marked
 @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android
 developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by
 Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we
 recommend migrating to the Java 7 API
 java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures
 permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system
 property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately
 configured.
