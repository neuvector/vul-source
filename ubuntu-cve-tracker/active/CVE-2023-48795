Description:
 The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in
 OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass
 integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension
 negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with
 a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or
 disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet
 Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake
 phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an
 effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with
 Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and
 (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects

Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Per upstream openssh developers:
  While cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack
  is fortunately very limited as it only allows deletion of
  consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of
  the protocol prevents user user authentication from proceeding and
  results in a stuck connection.
  The most serious identified impact is that it lets a MITM to
  delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
  starts, allowing the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke
  timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5. There is no
  other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity.
 mdeslaur> snapd aonly uses the terminal sub-package, not the ssh
 mdeslaur> part of golang-go.crypto, so it is not vulnerable
 sbeattie> putty fixes include some refactoring commits that are used
  by the added strict kex mode support
 mdeslaur> openssh-ssh1 is only provided for compatibility with old devices
 mdeslaur> that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. We will not be
 mdeslaur> providing any security support for the openssh-ssh1 package as
 mdeslaur> it is insecure and should be used in trusted environments only.
 jdstrand> snapd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto
 jdstrand> lxd in 18.04 LTS and earlier contains an embedded copy of
 jdstrand> golang-go.crypto
 sbeattie> proftpd-dfsg contains an ssh implementation in mod-sftp
  (distributed in proftpd-mod-crypto/proftpd-basic)
 mdeslaur> per Debian, libssh2 older than mantic isn't vulnerable as it
 mdeslaur> doesn't support ChaCha20-Poly1305 and CBC-EtM.
 ccdm94> libssh will be marked as not affected for bionic and earlier as per
 ccdm94> the above note. ChaCha20-Poly1305 and CBC-EtM are present only in
 ccdm94> libssh 0.8.0 (released 2018-08-10. Bionic is version 0.8.0, but
 ccdm94> based on commit 94fa1e38, which was released 2017-08-25) and later.
 ccdm94> Patches provided by upstream do not apply cleanly to versions in
 ccdm94> bionic and earlier as several functionalities are not present in
 ccdm94> these versions of the code (making backports a more likely to
 ccdm94> introduce regressions) further supporting the defined not affected
 ccdm94> status.
