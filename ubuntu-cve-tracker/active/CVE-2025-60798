Description:
 phpPgAdmin 7.13.0 and earlier contains a SQL injection vulnerability in
 display.php at line 396. The application passes user-controlled input from
 $_REQUEST['query'] directly to the browseQuery function without proper
 sanitization. An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
 execute arbitrary SQL commands through malicious query manipulation,
 potentially leading to complete database compromise.
