Description:
 PyDrive2 is a wrapper library of google-api-python-client that simplifies
 many common Google Drive API V2 tasks. Unsafe YAML deserilization will
 result in arbitrary code execution. A maliciously crafted YAML file can
 cause arbitrary code execution if PyDrive2 is run in the same directory as
 it, or if it is loaded in via `LoadSettingsFile`. This is a deserilization
 attack that will affect any user who initializes GoogleAuth from this
 package while a malicious yaml file is present in the same directory. This
 vulnerability does not require the file to be directly loaded through the
 code, only present. This issue has been addressed in commit `c57355dc`
 which is included in release version `1.16.2`. Users are advised to
 upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
