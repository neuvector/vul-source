Description:
 In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is
 vulnerable to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows
 non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount
 option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse
 configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system,
 accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file
 system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.
