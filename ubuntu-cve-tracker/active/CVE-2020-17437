Description:
 An issue was discovered in uIP 1.0, as used in Contiki 3.0 and other
 products. When the Urgent flag is set in a TCP packet, and the stack is
 configured to ignore the urgent data, the stack attempts to use the value
 of the Urgent pointer bytes to separate the Urgent data from the normal
 data, by calculating the offset at which the normal data should be present
 in the global buffer. However, the length of this offset is not checked;
 therefore, for large values of the Urgent pointer bytes, the data pointer
 can point to memory that is way beyond the data buffer in uip_process in
 uip.c.
