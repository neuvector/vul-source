Description:
 A memory leak could occur when a remote peer abruptly closes the socket
 without sending a GOAWAY notification. Additionally, if an invalid header
 was detected by nghttp2, causing the connection to be terminated by the
 peer, the same leak was triggered. This flaw could lead to increased memory
 consumption and potential denial of service under certain conditions.
 
 This vulnerability affects HTTP/2 Server users on Node.js v18.x, v20.x,
 v22.x and v23.x.
