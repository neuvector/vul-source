Description:
 OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
 Prior to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP
 body is sent multiple times to an OpenSIPS configuration that makes use of
 the `stream_process` function. This issue was discovered during coverage
 guided fuzzing of the function `codec_delete_except_re`. By abusing this
 vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects
 configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as
 the function `codec_delete_except_re`. This issue has been fixed in version
 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.
