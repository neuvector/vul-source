Description:
 An access control vulnerability was discovered in Grafana OSS where an
 Organization administrator could permanently delete the Server
 administrator account. This vulnerability exists in the DELETE
 /api/org/users/ endpoint.
 
 The vulnerability can be exploited when:
 
 1. An Organization administrator exists
 
 2. The Server administrator is either:
 
    - Not part of any organization, or
    - Part of the same organization as the Organization administrator
 Impact:
 
 - Organization administrators can permanently delete Server administrator
 accounts
 
 - If the only Server administrator is deleted, the Grafana instance becomes
 unmanageable
 
 - No super-user permissions remain in the system
 
 - Affects all users, organizations, and teams managed in the instance
 
 The vulnerability is particularly serious as it can lead to a complete loss
 of administrative control over the Grafana instance.
