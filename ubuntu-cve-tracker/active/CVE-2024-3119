Description:
 A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in all versions of sngrep since
 v0.4.2, due to improper handling of 'Call-ID' and 'X-Call-ID' SIP headers.
 The functions sip_get_callid and sip_get_xcallid in sip.c use the strncpy
 function to copy header contents into fixed-size buffers without checking
 the data length. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 code or cause a denial of service (DoS) through specially crafted SIP
 messages.
