Description:
 Apache XML Security for C++ through 2.0.4 implements the XML Signature
 Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig) specification without protection against an
 SSRF payload in a KeyInfo element. NOTE: the project disputes this CVE
 Record on the grounds that any vulnerabilities are the result of a failure
 to configure XML Security for C++ securely. Even when avoiding this
 particular issue, any use of this library would need considerable
 additional code and a deep understanding of the standards and protocols
 involved to arrive at a secure implementation for any particular use case.
 We recommend against continued direct use of this library.
