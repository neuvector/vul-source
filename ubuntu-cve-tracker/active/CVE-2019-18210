Description:
 Persistent XSS in /course/modedit.php of Moodle through 3.7.2 allows
 authenticated users (Teacher and above) to inject JavaScript into the
 session of another user (e.g., enrolled student or site administrator) via
 the introeditor[text] parameter. NOTE: the discoverer and vendor disagree
 on whether Moodle customers have a reasonable expectation that anyone
 authenticated as a Teacher can be trusted with the ability to add arbitrary
 JavaScript (this ability is not documented on Moodle's Teacher_role page).
 Because the vendor has this expectation, they have stated "this report has
 been closed as a false positive, and not a bug."
