Description:
 It was identified that if a cross-cluster API key
 https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.14/security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key.html#security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key-request-body
 restricts search for a given index using the query or the field_security
 parameter, and the same cross-cluster API key also grants replication for
 the same index, the search restrictions are not enforced during cross
 cluster search operations and search results may include documents and
 terms that should not be returned. This issue only affects the API key
 based security model for remote clusters
 https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.14/remote-clusters.html#remote-clusters-security-models
 that was previously a beta feature and is released as GA with 8.14.0
