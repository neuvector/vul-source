 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7953-1
Description:
 In PHP versions:8.1.* before 8.1.34, 8.2.* before 8.2.30, 8.3.* before
 8.3.29, 8.4.* before 8.4.16, 8.5.* before 8.5.1, the getimagesize()
 function may leak uninitialized heap memory into the APPn segments (e.g.,
 APP1) when reading images in multi-chunk mode (such as via php://filter).
 This occurs due to a bug in php_read_stream_all_chunks() that overwrites
 the buffer without advancing the pointer, leaving tail bytes uninitialized.
 This may lead to information disclosure of sensitive heap data and affect
 the confidentiality of the target server.
