Description:
 CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A
 cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the core HTML
 parsing module in versions of CKEditor4 prior to 4.24.0-lts. It may affect
 all editor instances that enabled full-page editing mode or enabled CDATA
 elements in Advanced Content Filtering configuration (defaults to `script`
 and `style` elements). The vulnerability allows attackers to inject
 malformed HTML content bypassing Advanced Content Filtering mechanism,
 which could result in executing JavaScript code. An attacker could abuse
 faulty CDATA content detection and use it to prepare an intentional attack
 on the editor. A fix is available in version 4.24.0-lts.
