Description:
 A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43 and classified as
 problematic. Affected by this issue is the function link_order_scan of the
 file ld/ldelfgen.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory
 leak. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is
 rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has
 been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a
 patch to fix this issue. The code maintainer explains: "I'm not going to
 commit some of the leak fixes I've been working on to the 2.44 branch due
 to concern that would destabilise ld. All of the reported leaks in this
 bugzilla have been fixed on binutils master."
