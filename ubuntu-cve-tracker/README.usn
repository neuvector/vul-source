USNs need a consistent voice and feel for the benefit of our users.

This document consolidates rules, guidelines and examples applying to USN
sections.

* General rules for the description

For every CVE involved in the USN, the description should be like:

[<name> discovered that <pkg>....] <problem>. <kinds of exploits possible>.
<result>

The first sentence explains the problem in the package. The second one explains
how an attacker could possibly exploit such problem, resulting in a security
issue.

Limit the length of each line in the description to 75 characters.

** Discoverer
For the discoverer <name>, check $UCT for the Discovered-by field. If it’s
empty, look for the discoverer in bugs, patches, etc. We only use real names
(not nicknames or organizations) in credits and be aware that the patch
supplier is not always the discoverer. If there is no discoverer available,
simply use: "It was discovered that <pkg> ..."

** Affected packages
For <pkg>, use the upstream package name in the title, description and
isummary (issue summary) sections. This not always matches with the ubuntu
source package name being patched. Only mention the package name, not affected
versions.

Make sure the source package description was properly set for every affected
release (i.e. the value for the usn.py --source-description argument in the
generated usn shell script is set). If it was not automatically populated, make
sure the source package is present in $UCT/meta_lists/package_info_overrides.json
and add it if it is not.

** CVEs references
If the USN involves multiple CVEs, write one paragraph for each one. Add
(CVE-XXXX-XXXX) at the end of each description, after the final dot.

If the description is identical for multiple CVEs, consolidate all into one
paragraph and list the CVEs in the brackets. e.g. (CVE-XXXX-XXXX, CVE-XXXX-XXXY)

If the USN has a single description (either only one CVE is being fixed or multiple
CVEs are being addressed that all share the same description) do not add the CVE
number(s) at the end of the description.

If a CVE only affected some of the releases mentioned in the USN, suffix the
paragraph with the sentence `This issue only affected <releases>.`, e.g.:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

If a CVE is only patched for some of the releases mentioned in the USN, suffix the
paragraph with the sentence `This issue was only addressed in <releases>.`,
e.g.: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

** Terms
Spell out terms. Instead of using "DoS", use "denial of service".

Don't capitalize terms. Instead of using "Denial of Service" use "denial of
service".

Avoid non-inclusive terms and phrases. Use "allowlist" in place of "whitelist"
and "denylist" or "blocklist" in place of "blacklist". Find alternative terms in
https://git.launchpad.net/usn-tool/tree/woke.yaml The scripts involved in the
USN publication process will use this suggestions to report possible
non-inclusive terms being mentioned.

** Vulnerability explanation

Be specific, but not overly detailed. Avoid being too technical. Use "under
certain circumstances" instead of detailing specific files, functions, etc.

Write the description in past tense. e.g.: "MySQL had a vulnerability" vs
"MySQL has a vulnerability".

If possible, fill in details on the adversary, e.g:
<An unprivileged || A privileged> <local || remote> attacker <with
x privileges>. If a live connection is needed for the vulnerability to be
exploited, use "authenticated user" instead of "attacker" to give a better
sense of the scope.

If the vulnerability requires user action, one possible template is:
If a user <or automated system> were tricked into <opening a specially crafted
<file type> || performing <action>> an attacker could possibly use this issue
to <result>.

For <kinds of exploits possible>, generally try to be as specific as possible.
Add: "<adversary> could possibly use this issue to ..." since we cannot confirm
how the adversary will take advantage of the vulnerability.

If the impact is not clear, use the following generic statement:
"resulting in <result>, or another unspecified impact".

** Regressions

Make sure the USN title is <pkg> regression. The description should say:
USN-XXXX-1 fixed <vulnerabilities | a vulnerability> in <pkg>. Unfortunately
that update <problem> and could introduce a regression. This updated fixes the
problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details: <USN-XXXX-1 description>


* General rules for the summary

If several CVEs are fixed in the USN, keep the summary as "Several issues were
fixed in <pkg>" (even if all CVEs share the same description).

Otherwise the summary should be written as: <pkg> could <result> if <condition>

* General rules for the title

<pkg> should respect the upstream name. If more than one CVE is fixed, make
sure the title is in plural: <pkg> vulnerabilities

* General rules for affected binaries

Even though more than one binary can be generated as part of the source package
update, the USN should only list the binary/binaries that are indeed affected
by the CVE/CVEs being fixed for every release.

* Examples

Memory management
-----------------
<name> discovered that <pkg> did not properly manage memory <condition>.
<kinds of exploits possible>. <result>

It was discovered that HTMLDOC did not properly manage memory under certain
circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted HTML
file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause HTMLDOC to
crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code
