Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> texmaker added an embedded copy of libtiff in bionic
 mdeslaur> Per the tiff developers, this API can't perform restrictions on
 mdeslaur> imagewidth and imagelength, as high values are also valid.
 mdeslaur> Application developers should be using the
 mdeslaur> TIFFOpenOptionsSetMaxSingleMemAlloc() API.
 mdeslaur> The upstream bug is likely to get closed, and this CVE rejected.
 mdeslaur> Marking as deferred for now.
