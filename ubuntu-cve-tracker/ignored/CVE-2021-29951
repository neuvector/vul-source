Description:
 The Mozilla Maintenance Service granted SERVICE_START access to
 BUILTIN|Users which, in a domain network, grants normal remote users access
 to start or stop the service. This could be used to prevent the browser
 update service from operating (if an attacker spammed the 'Stop' command);
 but also exposed attack surface in the maintenance service. *Note: This
 issue only affected Windows operating systems older than Win 10 build 1709.
 Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects
 Thunderbird < 78.10.1, Firefox < 87, and Firefox ESR < 78.10.1.
