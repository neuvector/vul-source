Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java
 Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 7 and earlier, Java System Development
 Kit (SDK) and JRE 1.4.2_12 and earlier 1.4.x versions, and SDK and JRE
 1.3.1_18 and earlier allow attackers to develop Java applets that read,
 write, or execute local files, possibly related to (1) integer overflows in
 the Java_sun_awt_image_ImagingLib_convolveBI, awt_parseRaster, and
 awt_parseColorModel functions; (2) a stack overflow in the
 Java_sun_awt_image_ImagingLib_lookupByteRaster function; and (3) improper
 handling of certain negative values in the
 Java_sun_font_SunLayoutEngine_nativeLayout function.  NOTE: some of these
 details are obtained from third party information.
