Description:
 httpTokenCacheKey uses path.Base to extract the expected HTTP-01 token
 value to lookup in the DirCache implementation. On Windows, path.Base acts
 differently to filepath.Base, since Windows uses a different path separator
 (\ vs. /), allowing a user to provide a relative path, i.e.
 .well-known/acme-challenge/..\..\asd becomes ..\..\asd. The extracted path
 is then suffixed with +http-01, joined with the cache directory, and
 opened. Since the controlled path is suffixed with +http-01 before opening,
 the impact of this is significantly limited, since it only allows reading
 arbitrary files on the system if and only if they have this suffix.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
 mdeslaur> 
 mdeslaur> Warning: do not include nullboot in the list of no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuilds after fixing an issue in golang.
 alexmurray> Only affects golang on Windows so golang on Ubuntu is not affected
