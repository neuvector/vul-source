Description:
 Wasmtime is a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime's
 filesystem sandbox implementation on Windows blocks access to special
 device filenames such as "COM1", "COM2", "LPT0", "LPT1", and so on, however
 it did not block access to the special device filenames which use
 superscript digits, such as "COM¹", "COM²", "LPT°", "LPT¹", and so on.
 Untrusted Wasm programs that are given access to any filesystem directory
 could bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special device
 filenames with superscript digits, and through them gain access peripheral
 devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped to those
 devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other
 device connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB
 serial ports. Patch releases for Wasmtime have been issued as 24.0.2,
 25.0.3, and 26.0.1. Users of Wasmtime 23.0.x and prior are recommended to
 upgrade to one of these patched versions. There are no known workarounds
 for this issue. Affected Windows users are recommended to upgrade.
