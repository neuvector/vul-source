Description:
 Improper sanitization of the value of the 'href' and 'xlink:href'
 attributes in '<image>' SVG elements in AngularJS's 'ngSanitize' module
 allows attackers to bypass common image source restrictions. This can lead
 to a form of  Content Spoofing
 https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Content_Spoofing  and also
 negatively affect the application's performance and behavior by using too
 large or slow-to-load images.
 
 This issue affects AngularJS versions greater than or equal to 1.3.1.
 
 Note:
 The AngularJS project is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to
 address this issue. For more information see  here
