Description:
 An out-of-memory flaw was found in libtiff that could be triggered by
 passing a crafted tiff file to the TIFFRasterScanlineSize64() API. This
 flaw allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted
 input with a size smaller than 379 KB.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> texmaker added an embedded copy of libtiff in bionic
 rodrigo-zaiden> fix in documentation only, marking all Ubuntu releases as
  ignored, as the fix in Documentation won't be of any usage in backports.
  if that is not the case, I'll be happy to move it back to an active status.
Mitigation:
