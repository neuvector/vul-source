Description:
 OpenSSH portable 4.1 on SUSE Linux, and possibly other platforms and
 versions, and possibly under limited configurations, allows remote
 attackers to determine valid usernames via timing discrepancies in which
 responses take longer for valid usernames than invalid ones, as
 demonstrated by sshtime.  NOTE: as of 20061014, it appears that this issue
 is dependent on the use of manually-set passwords that causes delays when
 processing /etc/shadow due to an increased number of rounds.
