Description:
 Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. To handle dependencies that come
 from a Git repository, Poetry executes various commands, e.g. `git config`.
 These commands are being executed using the executable’s name and not its
 absolute path. This can lead to the execution of untrusted code due to the
 way Windows resolves executable names to paths. Unlike Linux-based
 operating systems, Windows searches for the executable in the current
 directory first and looks in the paths that are defined in the `PATH`
 environment variable afterward. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary
 Code Execution, which would lead to the takeover of the system. If a
 developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist
 their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use
 their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability
 requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a
 remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when
 dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe. The victim could
 also not protect themself by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that
 might be present in the directory, because the behavior is undocumented.
 Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.
