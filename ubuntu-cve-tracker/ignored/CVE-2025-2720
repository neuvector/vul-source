Description:
 Rejected reason: ** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs:
 none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further
 investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: According to
 the code maintainer the call of the POC is invalid because the buffer
 pointed to by "data" must have "len" valid bytes. The docs were updated to
 make that clear.
