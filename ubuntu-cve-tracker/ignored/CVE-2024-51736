Description:
 Symphony process is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which executes
 commands in sub-processes. On Windows, when an executable file named
 `cmd.exe` is located in the current working directory it will be called by
 the `Process` class when preparing command arguments, leading to possible
 hijacking. This issue has been addressed in release versions 5.4.46,
 6.4.14, and 7.1.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.
