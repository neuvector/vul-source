Description:
 OpenSSH through 9.6, when common types of DRAM are used, might allow row
 hammer attacks (for authentication bypass) because the integer value of
 authenticated in mm_answer_authpassword does not resist flips of a single
 bit. NOTE: this is applicable to a certain threat model of attacker-victim
 co-location in which the attacker has user privileges.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices
 seth-arnold> that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not
 seth-arnold> provide security support for this package if doing so would
 seth-arnold> prevent access to equipment.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The researchers used a modified version of sshd to make this
 mdeslaur> vulnerability easier to demonstrate. There is no indication
 mdeslaur> the openssh package in Ubuntu can be exploited in the same way.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The upstream OpenSSH developers have chosen to ignore this issue
 mdeslaur> as this vulnerability isn't exploitable in practice, and needs
 mdeslaur> to be addressed by the hardware platform, not in OpenSSH itself.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Since there is nothing actionable here for Ubuntu, I am marking
 mdeslaur> this issue as ignored.
